football,"Inter-bound Stefan De Vrij was at the centre of a wild collapse as Lazio surrendered a Champions League place to Inter

Stefan De Vrij folded himself up small and hid his face underneath a training top, but he could not stop the cameras from honing in on him as he sat for the final time in Lazio’s home dugout. The curtain was coming down on the 2017-18 Serie A season, and the team whose shirt he was still wearing had just lost its Champions League spot to the one he will play for next year.A messy situation under any circumstances, but even more so for how events unfolded. Lazio had led 2-1 with 12 minutes remaining against Inter, in a game they only needed to draw. That was before De Vrij gave away a penalty, scything down Mauro Icardi. The Argentinian converted, and the Nerazzurri went on to win 3-2.Of course, there was more to it than that. Between Inter’s goals, Senad Lulić got himself sent off for a needless second yellow. Even before the penalty, Lazio’s manager, Simone Inzaghi, had ceded the initiative by taking off lone striker, Ciro Immobile, and sending on a full-back, Jordan Lukaku. There were echoes here of Inter’s collapse at home to Juventus last month.We might also point out that De Vrij was forced into his desperate challenge as a result of team-mates’ mistakes. Éder was granted too much space as he played a ball over the top to Icardi, whose run should have been tracked by Bastos. Thomas Strakosha could have been out quicker to close the angle too, but instead De Vrij was left scrambling.He might have been better served by keeping his feet, but would critics have been mollified if doing so had allowed Icardi to breeze past and bury a shot from open play? De Vrij, solid otherwise, was caught making a split-second decision for which there might not have been a right answer. The greater question is whether he ought to have been on the pitch in the first place.Then again, the dilemma facing Inzaghi was hardly straightforward. Lazio were without two key men – Luis Alberto and Marco Parolo have combined for 15 goals and 20 assists, before we even get into their broader contribution – and with Immobile only just back from injury. To deprive himself of De Vrij, his best centre-back, on top of that could hardly be done lightly.Inzaghi’s comments at the start of the week suggested he was considering his alternatives. It was only after a reported meeting between the defender and a group of the team’s ‘senators’ – senior players including Immobile, Parolo, Lulić, Lucas Leiva, and Ştefan Radu – that the final decision was made. The manager might also have considered how De Vrij saved Lazio from a potential defeat in their previous game, against Crotone, with a goal-line clearance.He refused to throw De Vrij under the bus, reminding reporters his team had opportunities to seal the deal sooner. Fourth place was theirs to lose after Inter lost at home to Sassuolo. If Lazio had just beaten Crotone – themselves relegated this weekend –Sunday’s match would have been a dead rubber.Instead, it is an occasion that may haunt this club for years to come. This has been an exceptional campaign for Lazio, whose 89 goals scored were both a club record and the most in Serie A. Inzaghi’s team also beat Juventus to the Supercoppa,reached the Coppa Italia semis as well as the quarter-finals of the Europa League.None of this was expected of a team whose budgetlags behind Inter, Juventus, Roma, Milan and Napoli. Credit is due to Inzaghi for forging a clear identity – that of a side who relinquish possession in favour of devastatingly direct counters – and sporting director Igli Tare, for building a squad so deep that Felipe Anderson, scorer of his team’s second goal on Sunday, can no longer hold down a regular starting spot.Lazio have, in Inzaghi’s words, “come one centimetre away from everything”. They exited the Coppa Italia on penalties, and the Europa League after blowing a three-goal aggregate lead in Salzburg – conceding three in five second-half minutes. Even in Serie A, they still finished levelwith Inter, behind them only by virtue of head-to-head results.Not that the Nerazzurri will feel much sympathy. The Stadio Olimpico will forever be the ground where they lost a title on 5 May 2002, with Lazio twice coming from behind to win 4-2 despite having nothing to play for on what was the final weekend. Inter, who began that day in first place, were overtaken by Juventus and Roma.Their fans, nevertheless, have a long-standing gemellaggio (twinning) with Lazio’s, which permitted a convivial atmosphere on Sunday. The number of Inter supporters attending the game was estimated at between 12,000-15,000.They celebrated long into the night, and will no doubt carry on into the summer. Inter have not played in the Champions League since 2011-12. To return to that competition is a critical element of the business plan drawn up by their Suning ownership group and might also have been the difference between hanging on to Icardi – who finished level with Immobile as Serie A’s top scorer on 29 – or seeing him depart.“Finally, all these goals are worth something,” said Icardi. He has scored 100 in five league seasons with Inter. Asked about De Vrij, he dismissed any suggestions of a conspiracy: “I don’t think he did it on purpose. Every professional tries to do things to the best of their ability, so if something like this happens it’s just fate.”Not everyone in Rome was feeling so generous, though De Vrij’s late substitution did not bring down the universal cacophony of jeers some might have expected. He has been a committed servant and key figure for Lazio these last four years. And now, in part thanks to his own foul, he is off to play in the Champions League for someone else.• Some way to sign off for Milan, who thrashed Fiorentina 5-1 to tie down sixth and spare themselves Europa League qualifying in July. It also guaranteed that Atalanta return to Europe, despite losing to Cagliari.• Crotone were unable to repeat last season’s great escape, losing 2-1 to Napoli. Walter Zenga appeared legitimately crushed, describing himself as “dead” and lamenting with understandable bitterness how direct rivals had put together runs of two or three wins at the end. • As for Napoli, victory meant they become the first team to break the 90-point barrier and not win a Scudetto. Whether Maurizio Sarri will still be in charge next season remains to be seen. The manager said he still needs to speak to his family, but owner Aurelio De Laurentiis indicated there was no more time for stalling.• And finally, farewell to Gigi Buffon – for Serie A, at least. There’s no way I could say everything that needs to be said in the few words left to me here, but this league will not be the same without the greatest keeper I’ve had the privilege to watch. Here’s hoping the next adventure proves as eventful and entertaining as the past 23 years.Juventus 2-1 Verona, Lazio 2-3 Inter, Sassuolo 0-1 Roma, Milan 5-1 Fiorentina, Cagliari 1-0 Atalanta, Chievo 1-0 Benevento, Napoli 2-1 Crotone, Spal 3-1 Sampdoria, Udinese 1-0 Bologna, Genoa 1-2 Torino."

Gianluigi Buffon is in advanced talks with Paris Saint-Germain over a move to the Ligue 1 champions that could mean he earns €7m a season.Buffon left Juventus at the end of the just-completed Serie A season following a glittering 17-year spell in Turin. Having arrived from Parma for a then world-record fee for a goalkeeper (£23m), the 40-year-old helped Juve win nine Serie A titles, as well as a further two chalked off following the Calciopoli scandal. During that time he also won the World Cup with Italy and established himself as arguably the best goalkeeper of his generation.Buffon said last week he had received offers to play elsewhere and it transpires one of those is from PSG. The French side are determined to win the Champions League and feel Buffon can provide experience and defensive nous alongside the attacking riches provided by Neymar and Kylian Mbappé.The goalkeeper held talks with PSG in Paris on Monday and will have further discussions on Tuesday. The club, who recently appointed Thomas Tuchel as manager, are prepared to hand the veteran a contact until 2020.Buffon is believed to be keen on the move and is likely to make a decision either way shortly."

On windswept astroturf around the corner from Anfield stadium, 34 men with a combined age of well over 2,500 were being put through their paces before their weekly walking football game. “Come on lads,” says their coach, Bill Bygroves. “Get those hips going. Pretend you’re dancing with your girlfriend — or boyfriend. That’s right, Jim. On your toes. Very nice. Can you believe he’s 90? Look at him go!”On the sidelines, one of England’s most successful players of all time winced as he stretched out his calves. “I think I’ll give this bit a miss today,” says Phil Neal, as men 20 years his senior followed orders to sit down with a ball between their feet. “I was at Kenny Dalglish’s golf day yesterday so I’m a bit worn out.” When he first turned up to the walking football sessions at Anfield sports and community centre last year, the other players thought they were dreaming. Surely that wasn’t Phil Neal lining up for selection. The Phil Neal. The only player to appear in all four of Liverpool’s European Cup victories between 1977 and 1984. Only Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs have won more trophies than his 23. The unforgiveable bubble perm had long given way to a shiny bald head but it was unmistakably him, the defender they nicknamed Mr Consistency.His new team-mates weren’t starstruck for long, despite many of them standing in the Kop during Neal’s heyday. Before he had a chance to get his bearings he’d been nutmegged by Tommy Doran, a 73-year-old retired builder. Until seizing that golden opportunity, Doran’s proudest footballing moment was aged eight, when an impromptu game in the Anfield car park with 50s Liverpool legend Louis Bimpson left him with a broken wrist.“Phil Neal is an idol of mine,” says Joe Blundell, 81. “I was amazed to see him here, but you quickly realise how ordinary he is.” He wondered whether the current generation of Liverpool stars would be doing the same in their dotage. “The money is so high now they live in another sphere, don’t they?” Maybe Mo Salah would, he mused. “He’s building a school and a hospital back home in Egypt, isn’t he?”Neal, along with his old team-mate Alan Kennedy, had been invited along by Bygroves, who doubles as Liverpool FC’s chaplain and was signed by Bill Shankly as a schoolboy. If it began as a charitable gesture it soon became a genuine passion for both veterans: Kennedy got so into the rapidly growing sport that he was recently selected for England’s first over 60s walking football team, alongside Bobby Charlton’s younger brother Tommy, 73.Both Kennedy and Neal are now regulars at Bygroves’ sessions, an initiative of Red Neighbours, Liverpool’s community outreach programme. Neither are paid to attend. The sessions are free, apart from the tea and biscuits afterwards. “I only joined up so I could give Phil Neal the runaround,” says Tony Perischine, a 74-year-old Evertonian, who plays with his brothers, aged 64 and 70. “Oi,” yells Bygroves, as Neal misses a pass. “Just ‘cos you’ve played in five Champions League finals doesn’t mean you don’t have to pay attention, mate.”At 67, Neal is one of the younger members of the Red Neighbours walking football squad. Though he doesn’t look it, Jim Mounsey, 90, is the oldest. Rules dictate that no one is allowed to tackle him or any of the octagenarians once they have the ball, but Mousney still looks sharp and scored a tidy penalty when the Guardian was in the stands. He joined up after a friend spotted a flyer in the local clinic and suggested he give it a go. He’d been looking for a way to keep fit after his local swimming baths shut down and now relishes the game. “I still feel the impulse to kick the ball,” he says.The sessions have been life-changing for Sol Sorsky, who is 82. When he started, in January, he couldn’t even kick the ball. He was not allowed to play at school — “I wore glasses and lads with glasses couldn’t play football” — and was dangerously overweight. “Everyone says I look fitter. I’m much happier. One of the other lads said to me the other day, ‘no offence but when you first came here you were a doddery old man. Now you’re a rottweiler!’”The social aspect is as important as the exercise, says Bygroves. Post-match refreshments often turn into a Beatles singalong with ladies from Red Neighbours’ walking netball team, who practise inside at the same time. The men even have their own supporters: Liz Hayes, 68, and Edith White, 79, who cheer from the sidelines.Neal insists he gets a decent workout from walking football, though he is trying to learn to take things a little easier: “My brain still thinks I’m a Liverpool full-back but my body has other ideas.”The non-contact rules dictate that he can’t tackle as hard as he did in his prime, and running is strictly forbidden. “But yes, you do let some of them get past. At 90, you deserve a clear chance at goal. You can still be as competitive as Klopp’s boys whatever your age.”"
football,"In April Nick Cushing’s charges were on course for the treble of WSL, FA Cup and Champions League. A few weeks later and securing second place is all that remains open to them

When Manchester City announced that their women’s team would be embarking on a ground-breaking tour of the United States this summer a glorious treble remained within the grasp of Nick Cushing’s side.It was April and optimism at the Etihad Campus, where Cushing’s players share many facilities with Pep Guardiola’s Premier League champions, was high. Then the setbacks began. First, City lost an FA Cup semi-final to Emma Hayes’s Chelsea and then Lyon knocked them out at the same stage of the Champions League, before Hayes’s team clinched the Women’s Super League title.Now one final, potentially crushing, disappointment must be avoided. With a renascent Arsenal only one point behind City going into Sunday afternoon’s final round of WSL fixtures, they dare not stumble at home to Everton. A slip could permit Joe Montemurro’s players, who travel to Bristol City, to leapfrog into second place and snatch the division’s last Champions League slot.In March Arsenal beat Cushing’s side in the Continental Cup final, ensuring there would be no repeat of the domestic double secured in 2016, the last full campaign before the game’s switch from a summer to a winter schedule.“It’s been a disappointing season,” concedes City’s England forward Nikita Parris. “But we’re still so close to qualifying for the Champions League. We’ve got a lot of young, developing players so we’re in a good place. Qualifying is massive. We’re determined to do it. It’s what this club needs.”A team apparently running on empty also look in need of a good rest before they face Paris Saint-Germain, North Carolina Courage and Chelsea at the inaugural International Champions Cup in Miami in late July. A training camp in Oregon follows but, for several of Cushing’s players, the American trip comes tightly sandwiched between World Cup qualifiers with England involving away dates in Russia in June and Wales in August.The presence of so many key components of Phil Neville’s squad in their ranks is both a blessing and a curse for City. Tellingly 10 of the starting XI Cushing deployed for the goalless Champions League semi-final first leg against Lyon had been called up by Neville this year, with the Lionesses’ participation in March’s SheBelieves Cup in the United States proving exhausting.For a time before Neville’s appointment City feared losing Cushing to England but the 33-year-old eventually withdrew from the FA’s shortlist, signing a new club contract. Off-pitch turmoil was averted but on it the absence of City’s captain, the centre-half Steph Houghton, with an ankle injury contributed to some vital points being dropped during February.By then the departures last summer of the outstanding England right-back Lucy Bronze to Lyon and the forward Toni Duggan to Barcelona were really being felt. Perhaps inevitably an expertly volleyed goal from Bronze gave Lyon a 1-0 aggregate Champions League win against her old club – the French champions face Wolfsburg in Kiev on Thursday.With City’s new Denmark striker Nadia Nadim struggling, Chelsea have proved the infinitely better-balanced unit. Significantly, the shortlist for the PFA female player of the year comprised five Chelsea stars and City’s Jill Scott. The award was deservedly won by Fran Kirby; the Chelsea forward blessed with a rare ability to play between the lines has barely stopped scoring this season.Hayes, who gave birth to a healthy baby boy on Thursday when Chelsea announced that the other twin she was expecting had sadly “failed to make it”, is undoubtedly an exceptional coach but Kirby’s catalytic presence remains the overwhelming reason for the six-point gap separating the top two.This gulf will not have gone down well with City’s Abu Dhabi-based ownership. Ditto the disappointing average attendances of around 1,500 at the women’s 7,000-capacity Academy Stadium. But next season offers a prospective new dawn and, in Keira Walsh, Mel Lawley and Georgia Stanway, Cushing has three of England’s brightest emerging talents.In 12 months that trio could well be preparing for the 2019 World Cup in France having helped City reclaim the game’s glittering prizes. First though a Champions League place needs guaranteeing."

So numerous are the consequences of a play-off victory, that it is impossible to parse in the aftermath. Best, then, to concentrate on the occasion. Inside a Wembley so loud that eardrums were under threat, and with the temperature rising on the field, Fulham kept their cool. Claiming a first-half lead that they refused to give up under relentless second-half pressure, the Cottagers edged past Aston Villa and have returned to the Premier League.The winning goal was scored by Fulham’s captain, Tom Cairney, and assisted by their teenage prodigy Ryan Sessegnon. To see these two young men celebrate with the trophy, Cairney still taking deep breaths to stay calm some 20 minutes after the final whistle, was a reminder of what this team has achieved. Largely shorn of big names, they have outplayed most of the division this season. Now, in front of 85,243 people, they played like the national stadium was their own back yard, and saw the job to completion.This was a triumph for the club no doubt, but also vindication for their manager, Slavisa Jokanovic. Promoted to the Premier League with Watford three years ago, he left (read: was edged out) before coaching a single game in the top flight.It is unlikely such an outcome will happen again, though. Jokanovic is trusted by Fulham’s owner, Shahid Khan – the man who intends to buy Wembley Stadium for himself – and this time, he will surely be rewarded not with the elbow but a new contract this summer.“It’s not easy to come to this place to decide what we fought for these past few years,” Jokanovic said. “It was a really important victory for us and we deserved it. It’s not easy to play with lots of pressure, with lots of young players, and on the other side lots of experience. It was the first experience for me [of the play-off final], the first for 18-year-old players, but we played with character and expression.“I am personally satisfied because this is our project. This Fulham is my club, my staff, our way for trying to get a team promoted. We needed two-and-a-half years. First year not to be relegated, second to start building the team.“This year we improved a little bit more and came back after a bad beginning. Now we must adapt ourselves, we must know that the Premier League is the most competitive league and we must be clever. I will think about the new season in a few days. But tonight I will drink some beers.”The decisive goal came in the 23rd minute, with Sessegnon cutting in off his inside-left position to meet a forward pass from Kevin McDonald. The teenager took a heavy first touch but was alert enough to chase it down. He won a 50-50 with Conor Hourihane to recover possession, and then turned and sized up the situation in an instant. He picked out the perfect pass between John Terry and Alan Hutton. Cairney read it, ran onto it and calmly placed it under the Villa goalkeeper Sam Johnstone from 10 yards out.Villa had only flickered in the match to this point and had no response for the rest of the first half. Words were shared in the dressing room and Steve Bruce’s men returned to give it their all in the final 45 minutes. They were led by Jack Grealish, Villa’s own young talisman, who reminded everyone of the potential that has always been in his play.A solo slalom from the 22-year-old on the hour nearly ended in the most glorious of equalisers, but after beating four Fulham defenders his shot was deflected into the body of goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli.Fulham were reduced to 10 men with 20 minutes remaining, after Denis Odoi was dismissed for a second caution for fouling Grealish, a marked man throughout. It presented a potential opportunity for Villa to exploit, but they spurned it by throwing too many attackers on the field and losing their composure. Fulham’s, for their part, never wavered for a moment.“They set out to rough up Grealish, it was part of their game plan,” said a shell-shocked Steve Bruce. “But we didn’t do enough around Grealish. The second half was much better from us but to be brutally honest it wouldn’t have been too hard.“The feeling now is utter disappointment for everybody and the next hard part is where we go from here. But let’s not forget we’re Aston Villa, we’re a proud club, a big club with big history. I’m really upset for everyone but I’ll roll my sleeves up and go for it again.”Time ticks on and those questions about next season will soon press for both clubs. But matches of this scale do not come along for these clubs or their supporters that often. The task is to make the most of them and, regardless of the outcome, both teams can feel they did their best."
football,"Burnley, Huddersfield and Brighton to be relegated? It felt like the right answer at the time

Every year we step up and make bold predictions about the Premier League season and every year we are proved a little bit right and more than a little bit wrong. Burnley, Huddersfield and Brighton fans, we apologise. Manchester City fans, we told you so.What we said: “Pep Guardiola appears to have addressed last season’s defensive frailties but will they have time to defend if the manager sticks to an attacking philosophy?”What happened: City managed just 12 clean sheets in Guardiola’s first season in charge but signings such as Ederson, Kyle Walker and Danilo meant his side were just as competent in defence as they were in attack in 2017-18. They were our favourites to win the Premier League title but the records they have broken in the process has surprised everyone.What we said: “Manchester United have to be true contenders for the Premier League title. This is the minimum demand and undeniable truth facing José Mourinho as he embarks on a second campaign leading the record 20-times champions.”What happened: Manchester United never really contended for the league but they did finish second – “best of the rest” as Mourinho put it – and they made it to the FA Cup final.What we said: “While these are exciting times for a club on the rise, Tottenham are also entering a period that will call for patience. Optimism is high after they finished second for the first time in the Premier League, allowing them to claim supremacy of north London at last, but a sense of perspective will also be required during what could be an awkward season. The potential dilemma for Tottenham is they will exist in something akin to a state of limbo for a year, stuck between their past and future.”What happened: Worries that Tottenham were to be stuck between the old and new White Hart Lane having temporarily moved to Wembley were averted under Mauricio Pochettino. The lack of silverware is still a concern, but Champions League qualification was always a near certainty.What we said: “In Coutinho, Salah, Mané, Firmino, Daniel Sturridge – who had earned Klopp’s approval with his sharpness this summer only to suffer a thigh injury while scoring in the 3-0 defeat of Bayern – Solanke, Divock Origi and the fit-again Danny Ings, Liverpool boast a formidable range of strikers. They will be needed.”What happened: We knew Liverpool had goals in their squad but who could have foreseen the genius of 32-goal Mohamed Salah? We predicted Liverpool would finish outside of the top four but unfortunately were not asked about their Champions League performance.What we said: “Antonio Conte has said he wants to avoid a Mourinho-style second season following Chelsea’s title triumph, something he should manage to achieve.”What happened: Expect the unexpected at Chelsea. A damning 3-0 defeat to Newcastle on the final day confirmed that they will be playing in the Europa League next year.What we said: “Arsenal continue to make defiant noises but some uncertainty is inevitable surrounding all those important players going into the final year of their deal. Alexis Sánchez is the most critical situation because of his status as goal-getter-in-chief and shiniest star, with Mesut Özil and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain just behind. The purchase of Alexandre Lacazette is a promising one.”What happened: Sánchez left, Oxlade-Chamberlain left and so did Arsène Wenger.What we said: “They will again be looking to average around a point a game, which may or may not be enough to keep them up. It all depends on the teams around them, though Burnley seem happy enough to embrace that challenge. Unlike many teams who have been in their situation before, the Clarets appear comfortable in the knowledge that if the worst came to the worst, another season in the Championship would not kill them.”What happened: Sean Dyche’s team will be playing in the Europa League next season, along with Chelsea and Arsenal, and not in the Championship as predicted.What we said: “Koeman’s hope is that the winning mentality of Rooney and others will rub off on the young talent he regularly deployed last season, and who now find the competition for a starting role fiercer than ever.”What happened: The joy was short lived. Ronald Koeman was replaced by Sam Allardyce as manager and their spending failed in an underwhelming season that did not yield Europa League qualification as expected.What we said: “The prospect of aiming at little more than serene top-flight mediocrity may seem uninspiring for the 2015-16 champions but it is hard to see how Craig Shakespeare’s side can consistently trouble the top teams.”What happened: Shakespeare achieved uninspiring mediocrity and was fired, with Claude Puel drafted in to bring some stability.What we said: “As long as Rafa Benítez remains in charge of Newcastle a potentially very exciting future beckons.”What happened: Rightly predicted as the best finishers from the newly promoted teams, Newcastle were quickly assured of their safety from relegation and finished the campaign with an impressive 3-0 win against Chelsea.What we said: “Never before has this club enjoyed a fifth successive campaign among the elite. More to the point, in Frank de Boer they have appointed a manager of status charged with making them feel they truly belong. There is risk involved in this team’s pursuit of progression. Alan Pardew had attempted to transform a side whose forte was counterattacking effervescence into a more possession-based team. Those intentions were well-meaning and born of long-term vision, that desire to evolve, but results suggested their implementation was far from smooth.”What happened: Frank de Boer was sacked just four games into the season and Roy Hodgson came in to oversee an impressive charge up the table.What we said: “Bournemouth have made relatively light work of exceeding expectations since promotion to the Premier League in 2015, reaping the rewards of Howe’s thirst to improve and evolve.”What happened: Stability under Eddie Howe has become the normality for Bournemouth; another season of Premier League football awaits.What we said: “Slaven Bilic’s side will hope for a smoother second season at the London Stadium but, with a shift in transfer policy and doubts over the manager’s tactics and future, it is hard to detect a clear plan at the club.”What happened: Slaven Bilic lost his job with West Ham in the relegation zone. His replacement, David Moyes, helped keep them up.What we said: “Marco Silva has already shown the common touch with fans, which suggests his new club can put the unloved Walter Mazzarri era behind them.”What happened: Few forecasted that Silva would lose his job by January, but Javi Gracia has steadied the ship.What we said: “The size of the task facing Brighton & Hove Albion needs no introduction but a little context might help. Their first Premier League opponents, Manchester City, handed over more money for a pair of glistening full-backs this summer than the £93m Brighton paid for their impressive Amex Stadium.”What happened: Like Newcastle and Huddersfield, newly promoted Brighton bravely battled the threat of relegation and secured their place in next year’s Premier League. Chris Hughton achieved his remit of securing top flight football for another year with relative ease.What we said: “David Wagner ranks his team as the biggest underdogs in Premier League history but, with the German in charge, they should be optimistic rather than fearful.”What happened: Huddersfield drew with Chelsea and Manchester City in the final week of the season to stay up.What we said: “It is happening again, with Southampton a victim of their own success. Virgil Van Dijk, a steal for the £11.5m they paid Celtic two years ago, has excelled, quickly establishing himself as one of the best defenders in the Premier League, in the same way Sadio Mané did as a winger or Victor Wanyama as a holding midfielder, both of whom moved on. As with Mané, Dejan Lovren and Nathaniel Clyne the next step seems increasingly inevitable – although this time it dare not be Liverpool.”What happened: Van Dijk went to Liverpool, Mauricio Pellegrino was sacked and Southampton were nearly relegated.What we said: “Swansea’s prospects for the season are likely to depend heavily on how astutely the club reinvest the biggest transfer fee in their history.”What happened: Gylfi Sigurdsson’s departure damaged the Swans’ chances of survival and continued the forecasted decline from 8th at the end of the 2014-15 season. A relegation fight was always on – a battle that they lost after defeat to Stoke City.What we said: “Stoke are the Premier League’s hard core. Unlikely to challenge for silverware but unlikely to be relegated either, they exist primarily as a sort of man-trap to keep teams with loftier ambitions on their mettle. Stoke have built their reputation on cutting bigger sides down to size.”What happened: Mark Hughes was sacked in January and replaced by Paul Lambert but they endured a doomed season.What we said: “The problem West Brom have is this: they are more stable than ever, more wealthy than ever, too, but it is difficult to shake the view that they are punching as high as they can.”What happened: Darren Moore won half of his games in charge but it was too little too late after the team’s poor run under Tony Pulis and Alan Pardew."

Shortly after 5pm on Saturday evening the mood at the Riverside is expected to turn almost unbearably poignant. For a few moments at least the impending, potentially season-defining duels, between Adama Traoré and Alan Hutton and Britt Assombalonga and John Terry, will no longer seem to matter quite so much.As Middlesbrough prepare to kick off against Aston Villa in a play-off semi-final which could help transform club finances and individual careers, Leo Percovich is scheduled to complete an emotional journey from Rio de Janeiro to the stadium’s posh seats.Boro’s former goalkeeping coach will be serenaded as fans acknowledge his emotional bravery in travelling so far to thank them for their support in the wake of the car crash in Brazil last December which killed the 50-year-old Uruguayan’s daughters Antonella and Valentina, aged five and 10.Now recovered, physically, from the injuries they sustained as their car plunged off a 20-metre-high bridge, his wife Juliana and son Pietro are scheduled to join Percovich as he pays tribute to those supporters who raised thousands of pounds to help meet their medical costs.Percovich fell in love with the club and the Teesside area during his days as former Boro manager Aitor Karanka’s key lieutenant, happily engaging with fans as the team reached the Premier League two years ago.A message to #Boro's fans from Leo Percovich 💬 #UTB pic.twitter.com/1ExwyavYyiDown in the away dugout, Steve Bruce aims to mastermind the fifth promotion of his managerial career but he, too, may struggle to maintain a brave public face.As Percovich returned to work coaching Fluminense juniors, Aston Villa’s manager was embarking on a “terrible few months” involving the death of his father Joe in February and his mother Sheenagh late last week.For the past three months Bruce has made the eight-hour round trip from Birmingham to the Newcastle hospital where Sheenagh lay seriously ill three times a week but he remains determined to stave off exhaustion long enough to restore Villa to the Premier League.Doing so will involve tactically outwitting Tony Pulis by subduing a winger once happily discarded by Villa but now the subject of £30m transfer market interest from, among others, Chelsea. More immediately Traoré is determined to help Boro through this two-leg semi-final before celebrating a Wembley final victory financial experts estimate would be worth a minimum £170m to a club relegated only last spring.Doing his bit to help secure that windfall, the former Barcelona protege strode to the away end at Ipswich following last Sunday’s 2-2 draw, clutching a large bag filled with replica shirts emblazoned with his name, number and the word “believe”. Traoré distributed them to those who had made the trek south, with his choice of message perhaps instructive. A player never trusted by Tim Sherwood and Remi Garde at Villa and treated with a certain scepticism by Karanka and then Garry Monk on Teesside has morphed into surely the Championship’s most exciting player courtesy of the immense faith Pulis has, somewhat unexpectedly, placed in him.The former West Brom and Stoke manager, by similarly breathing new life into the suddenly free-scoring Patrick Bamford, has duly deconstructed all sorts of received wisdoms about his supposed modus operandi.Granted, Pulis never appears averse to using one pass instead of three, 40% of Boro’s goals come from set pieces and he swiftly installed Ryan Shotton, a physically imposing centre-half blessed with a long throw, at right back, yet his startling reinvention of Traoré and Bamford suggests he is an infinitely more subtly nuanced manager than previously advertised.If Hutton, deputising for the hamstrung Neil Taylor at left-back, will not relish facing Traoré’s scouring pace, Pulis must somehow nullify the gifted Robert Snodgrass’s catalytic attacking midfield talent while keeping his defenders alert to Lewis Grabban’s goal poaching knack.Boro’s “Red Faction” or “Ultras” – AKA the club’s hard-core support – intend to assist by creating a wall of noise as they proudly unfurl their hallmark “The Infant Hercules” banner.That was Middlesbrough’s moniker in the glory days when Teesside loomed large on the world map as a key international industrial centre effectively responsible for coating half the planet in steel and metal. Designed and built by a Middlesbrough firm, the Sydney Harbour bridge is just one element of the enduring legacy of the so called “town that built the world”.Now Pulis hopes its football team can reach and conquer Wembley. “We need the Riverside to be rocking,” he said. “Villa are a massive club with arguably the Championship’s best squad. It’ll be very tough but we’re in good form. I’m looking forward to a tremendous atmosphere.”Bruce senses the mounting adrenaline. “As I always say: ‘You can smell the hotdogs,’” said Villa’s manager. “You can smell a big occasion like this.”"

In many respects, the 2017-18 Ligue 1 campaign represented a return to business as usual. PSG blew their rivals out of the water, reclaiming the title from Monaco, and Lyon and Marseille confirmed that, with their new investors, they are slowly returning to a place where they can challenge for the league title. While the summer transfers of Neymar and Kylian Mbappé caught the eye around the world, this season has been a watershed moment in terms of coaches setting up their sides to play more entertaining, attacking football. From Unai Emery at PSG to Olivier Dall’Oglio at Dijon, managers ensured their teams put on spectacles, representing a definitive departure from a more turgid style of football. There were 1,033 goals scored this campaign (2.72 per match), the highest since the 1982-83 season. So, who deserves special recognition following a truly memorable year?Despite not being shortlisted for this award by the UNFP (the footballers’ union), Gustavo is fully deserving of it, having been Marseille’s midfield lynchpin all season. He has brought a new level of resolve and attacking impetus to the side, with the odd spectacular goal thrown in for good measure. The difference between the Brazilian and the player he replaced, William Vainqueur, was worth far more than the extra 15 points Marseille amassed compared to last season. He has not been as individually brilliant as Neymar or even Nabil Fékir – the other players we considered – but we have chosen Gustavo for his consistency and the way he has improved.This goal combines quality, power and sheer audacity. Taking the ball in his stride from midfield after pressing a Bordeaux throw, Fékir takes aim and delivers a shot from the halfway line, driven with such power that it barely rises on its path into the back of the net. There are several other contenders for this award, including strikes by Malcom, Benjamin Jeannot and Layvin Kurzawa, but Fékir’s goal is without peer.Kylian Mbappé and Malcom had the more eye-catching moments, and the other members of Lyon’s midfield triumvirate – Houssem Aouar and Tanguy N’Dombélé – were more imaginative but, as with Gustavo, consistency has made the difference in this category. Tousart’s steady presence at the base of midfield has been a constant for Lyon this season, no small feat for a player who only recently turned 21. Even as the team has weathered injury and tactical switches aplenty, the former Valenciennes man has been a metronomic presence, flexible, intelligent and superb in the air, allowing Lyon’s attacking football to thrive without sacrificing their defensive shape.Despite taking only one point, Marseille truly re-announced themselves as a force to be reckoned with in this game. A typically raucous crowd at the Vélodrome witnessed a red card for Neymar, who had squared up to Lucas Ocampos, and what they thought was a volleyed winner from Florian Thauvin after Luis Gustavo and Neymar both scored in the first half. A pulsating, eventful encounter ended in irony. With Neymar dismissed, Edinson Cavani was free to crash home a free-kick in injury time to equalise. A month earlier, Neymar’s histrionics over Cavani impinging on what he saw as his responsibility had granted him sole charge of dead balls.Two years ago, Amiens scraped promotion from France’s semi-pro third tier, the Championnat National, finishing third behind Strasbourg and Orleans. A year later they were a place and a division higher and on their way to Ligue 1. In 2017-18, Pélissier managed his greatest achievement: 13th place in the top flight with the league’s smallest budget. Their defence, virtually unchanged from the third division, was the third best in Ligue 1. Incredible.For “season” read “century”. Although Neymar’s first, and hopefully not only, season in Ligue 1 was exhilarating and frustrating in equal measure, the interest and investment it has generated in French football has ignited the entire division. Foreign investors are ready to support Nantes and St Étienne among others this summer, money which may not have emerged otherwise. Neymar’s legacy may prove to be more than PSG’s obliterating the world record fee, whether he stays or not.Régis Gurtner, AmiensBouna Sarr, MarseilleHilton, MontpellierMarcelo, LyonJordan Amavi, MarseilleLuiz Gustavo, MarseilleLucas Tousart, LyonFlorian Thauvin, MarseilleNabil Fékir, LyonNeymar, PSGEdinson Cavani, PSGSubs: Anthony Lopes (Lyon), Prince Gouano (ASC), Ruben Aguilar (Montpellier), Tanguy N’Dombélé (Lyon), Memphis Depay (Lyon), Rony Lopes (Monaco), Karl Toko-Ekambi (Angers).Some controversy still lingers over decision to give Mandanda Ligue 1’s official goalkeeper of the year award but he did regularly pull off the spectacular this season, with Marseille’s leaky defence forcing him into action more frequently than he would have liked. Against Angers early in the season, Romain Thomas appeared to have sent Mandanda the wrong way at a set-piece, but the keeper pulled off a stunning fingertip save, diving to his left to preserve a point at a time in the season when Marseille were yet to become the juggernaut seen in the run-in.It’s always a fiery occasion when these two regional rivals meet, but Fékir ensured there was no love lost after scoring Lyon’s fifth and final goal against the 10 men of Saint-Étienne. After beating Stéphane Ruffier, he strode over to the home end, stripped off his armband and held his jersey aloft in front of the supporters. Sainté had their revenge in a 1-1 later in the season, but Fékir’s hubris was one of the defining moments of the season, increasing his cult status in Lyon and becoming even more hated at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard.Referencing the cult TV series Breaking Bad, Rennes’ massive image of Walter White was superb. The hosts were unable to secure the desired result but their fans’ enthusiasm serves as a fine example of the creativity and passion for the game often on display in western France.Bordeaux’s young winger, Malcom, is undoubtedly very skilled on the pitch, but he is not so good at considering the potential ramifications of his actions on social media. Bordeaux’s 2-0 defeat at Caen in January was their seventh in eight matches, including a painful elimination from the Coupe de France by amateur side Granville. The youngster’s video of him and some of his team-mates laughing and joking after the defeat enraged the club’s fans, with no small amount of justification.“If we go down, you will go down,” chanted Lille’s pitch-invading supporters following their draw with Montpellier in early March. Their cries were directed at owner Gérard Lopez, whose transfer policy had left the club’s top-flight status in doubt, and in this case, despite Lille’s eventual survival, the moment remains an entirely frightening reminder of how closely intertwined violence can be with football in France.The official referee of the season award was not handed out at this month’s glitzy ceremony in Paris as its recipient was to be Tony Chapron, who has been suspended for three months after a bizarre incident in PSG’s 1-0 win over Nantes in January. As PSG counter-attacked the Nantes defender Diego Carlos, in chasing back to defend, accidentally clipped Chapron’s heel. Much to everyone’s amazement, the referee swivelled around and aimed a kick at Carlos as he fell, before sending off the defender. A three-month ban for Chapron was perhaps a little lenient. His fellow officials have rallied around their disgraced colleague in a show of solidarity but he is expected to retire.Another unexpected storyline of this season was the gusto with which the sleeping-giant Olympico derby between Marseille and Lyon returned. Memphis Depay’s late header gave Lyon a brilliant 3-2 win at the Vélodrome in March, but the drama was far from over. The aftermath began as Lyon defender Marcelo left the field, taunting Marseille fans with his No6 shirt, the number of points Lyon had taken from Marseille in this league campaign. It ended with a brawl in the tunnel that involved dozens, including Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas. Adil Rami had to be restrained from attacking Marcelo, whose wife jumped to his defence in a bizarre series of Snapchat stories.Ligue 1 is full of forwards with less than impressive goal records. The continued employment of these wayward strikers remains a mystery. None have been more fortuitous than Nolan Roux. Despite being a regular for a number of sizeable Ligue 1 clubs, including Lille and St Étienne, 30-year-old Roux had never hit double figures. To say his tally of 15 goals for bottom club Metz is a “surprise” is something of an understatement. With promoted Reims already keen on the Frenchman, Roux seems to have, somehow, bought himself another year in France’s top flight.Given the disastrous season Lille have experienced, their players could be forgiven for wanting out. Nevertheless the sight of Lille captain Ibrahim Amadou turning up at Crystal Palace, Peter Odemwingie style, on the final day of the winter transfer window seemed more than a little desperate. A €14m bid had been submitted but, beholden by a transfer ban on incoming players, Lille were reluctant to sell and Amadou left London as the window shut, hood up and empty-handed.• This is an article from Get French Football News• Follow Eric Devin, Adam White and Get French Football News on Twitter"

Stoke City have appointed Gary Rowett as their new manager on a three-year contract after agreeing a compensation package with Derby County.They will be looking to him to bring about an immediate return to the Premier League after replacing Paul Lambert, who left the club last Friday after their relegation to the Championship.“This has come round quite quickly but I am absolutely delighted to make the move to such an ambitious football club,” Rowett told the club’s official website.“This is a club that has been established in the Premier League for some time and the challenge for me now is to get Stoke City back into that division as soon as possible,” the 44-year-old added.Rowett has agreed a move after asking his former club, Derby, permission to talk to the Stoke board on Monday. Rowett led the Rams to this season’s play-off semi-finals, where they lost to Fulham, and previously managed Burton Albion and Birmingham City.“There are certain things to do now and to get right but the undoubted ambition of myself and the people above me is to take this club back up as soon as we possibly can,” Rowett added.“You have to be robust enough to face 46 games, have the correct mentality to approach going to varying grounds, and you have to be ready to match the quality of opponents too because the standard of this league has gone up enormously.”Peter and John Coates, the club’s chairman and vice-chairman, said in a statement: “We are delighted to be able to move so quickly to secure Gary’s services and we are now looking forward to working with him towards our objective of returning to the Premier League as soon as possible.”"

How fitting that Manchester City would finish an extraordinary season with a bang. After plucking Kevin De Bruyne’s exquisite flighted ball out of the summer air with his left foot, the substitute Gabriel Jesus hoisted a wonderful dinked effort into the net with his right, with only two seconds of three added minutes left on the clock, racking up the champions’ 32nd win of the campaign, attaining a landmark and record-breaking century in the process.As Jesus whipped off his shirt, wheeling away before being mobbed by his team-mates, Pep Guardiola, his manager, punched the air with both fists before half of his technical area emptied towards the delirious away support. It had looked as though the 100-point mark would evade them and that they would end the season on something of a bum note until Jesus’s timely reminder that this City side are no ordinary team. “A lot of goals, concede few, lots of points, wins at home, wins away, everything was perfect this season – and finished the way we deserved to finish,” Guardiola said. “Premier League, 100 points, I still cannot believe it, it is a massive achievement.”“One hundred points is a lot, [that is] 50 points at home, 50 points away, it means how stable, how good we were all the season. The numbers are always consequences of what we have done in terms of the way we play, our mentality. You cannot achieve what we achieve in terms of many, many records if you are not a humble team, professional, [that] has that desire to take the ball and win and win and win. It’s massive, it’s a lot of points, it’s now time to rest – except the guys who go to the World Cup – time to rest, enjoy the summer and prepare well for the next season.”One minor worry for Guardiola is that he may be about to lose one of his assistants, with Mikel Arteta of interest to Arsenal, as they search for Arsène Wenger’s successor. “What we have done this season, for all the staff, Mikel, his contribution, was outstanding, amazing. We were together so good, all the staff, Mikel. So if he stays, I will be happiest guy in the world. If he decides to move because he has this offer, this option, I will not say you don’t have to go. I want the best for my friends and he’s a friend of mine and I want the best. If he decides to go, I will be so sad but I will understand his decision, because it’s his career, his life, his family, and I am not right guy to say you don’t have to do that. But hopefully, hopefully he can stay and finish what we have started together in the coming years.”City were made to work for their final win of a brilliant title-winning campaign, though. Southampton were at leisure for long periods, with the defender Wesley Hoedt rattling the crossbar in the first half. Guardiola’s side never really got a grip on the game until Jesus was introduced on the hour mark. Until then the returning Raheem Sterling, who himself struck the woodwork after dancing round the edge of the box, had led a City line that lacked killer instinct in the continued absence of Sergio Agüero. Leroy Sané slid a cross into an empty box before the ball ricocheted towards Fernandino, lurking near the penalty spot, only for the Brazilian to drive over.Guardiola, sleeves rolled up, stalking his technical area, acknowledged something had to change and soon Jesus entered in place of Fabian Delph. It was Southampton who had the next glimpse of goal, though, with Fernandinho clearing off the line from Dusan Tadic, who had beaten the offside trap and twice skirted round Claudio Bravo, with the Manchester City goalkeeper frantically scampering round his box. Then came Brahim Díaz and 17-year-old Phil Foden, for their fifth league appearances of the season – ensuring each of them one of 40 Premier League medals in the process – before Jesus popped up to finish an unforgettable season in considerable style, lifting the ball over Alex McCarthy after latching on to De Bruyne’s brilliant ball.For Southampton, their post-match lap of appreciation must have felt a little bittersweet at the end of an enormous week, in which they secured their league status after a crucial victory at now relegated Swansea City. “Tuesday night was the key one for us but I thought we put in a really professional performance, which I demanded,” Mark Hughes, the Southampton manager said, adding he expects the club’s hierarchy to make a swift decision over his future and whether he will lead Saints next season. “You expect the best team in England to always go to the end. They are an outstanding team.”City, meanwhile, have tied down their goalkeeper Ederson to a new contract which will keep him at the club until 2025."

A long, traumatic season for Steve Bruce could yet deliver a happy ending of sorts as Aston Villa moved to within 90 minutes of a return to the Premier League. For Bruce, who has been through such a distressing time after losing both parents in the last three months, it would be a remarkable achievement if he can see this gruelling campaign through and mastermind his fifth promotion to the top flight.Fulham await at Wembley on Saturday week after Villa, playing with resilience and courage, frustrated a Middlesbrough side that were left to rue the goal that Mile Jedinak headed in at the Riverside in the first leg and the lack of conviction in their attacking play on a night when they started with only one striker and failed to register a shot on target.On an evening gripped with tension from start to finish, the real drama arrived late and left Tony Pulis bemoaning Mike Dean’s failure to send off Sam Johnstone after the Aston Villa goalkeeper, dashing from his line, handled outside the area to prevent Adama Traoré’s shot from looping over his head in the 88th minute. Although John Terry was trying to get back and cover, it was questionable whether the Villa captain would have been able to retrieve the situation, yet Dean decided only to show a yellow card to Johnstone.Stewart Downing’s shot from the free-kick that followed clipped the crossbar and with that Middlesbrough’s hopes of returning to the Premier League at the first time of asking were extinguished. Pulis, in fairness to him, made the point afterwards that Fulham and Villa deserve to be in the play-off final after finishing third and fourth respectively, but there was no getting away from just how frustrated he was with Dean’s interpretation of that controversial incident.“I’m really disappointed. Everybody can see it and everybody understands the rules. And you need the referee to make the correct decision and I don’t think he made the correct decision,” Pulis said. “I know it’s a big game, he’s a Premier League referee with lots of experience and you’d expect him to get those decisions right. I’m not saying it would have made a difference because it was so late in the game, but that doesn’t stop him making the right decision.”Bruce had some sympathy for his counterpart, with the Villa manager conceding“maybe the referee got that one wrong,” yet the truth is that Boro never did enough to win this play-off semi-final. It was not until 20 minutes from time that Pulis showed any real ambition by playing with two up front against a Villa rearguard that were always going to be difficult to break down.“I think what’s got us through is defensively over both games,” Bruce said. “Defensively we’ve been very, very good all season. And if there is any team that deserved to win tonight, I thought it was us. Their goalkeeper made two or three good saves but, the longer it goes on, towards the end, when he hits the crossbar, you think dear oh dear, you can’t put me through that. Thankfully the little bit of luck was with us today.”Lewis Grabban and Jack Grealish came closest to scoring in a game where the stakes were much higher than the quality of the football. The best move of the match saw Albert Adomah, who was a lively presence on the Villa left, swap passes with Grealish before delivering a low cut-back that ended with Grabban’s near-post shot being saved by Darren Randolph. The goalkeeper later clawed away Grealish’s curling 30-yard effort.Middlesbrough, in contrast, created little despite enjoying more possession and pinning Villa back for periods. Traoré showed a few bursts of speed but he was generally well shackled by Alan Hutton, who Bruce described as “absolutely outstanding” over the two legs. Indeed, it was hard to see the visitors scoring from anything other than a set-piece.For Villa, the focus now turns to Fulham and what promises to be a completely different challenge at Wembley, where they will come up against the best footballing side in the Championship. Bruce, however, has history on his side when it comes to the play-offs – he won promotion with Birmingham and Hull via this route – and the vast experience in his dressing room could also be an important factor. “It’s been so valuable to bring those players in to help turn this club around,” he said."

Welcome to theguardian.com review of the 2017-18 Premier League season. We have nominated some contenders for this category but this is just to get the discussion going: offer your suggestions below the line …While compelling arguments can be made for awarding a number of different bosses the accolade of manager of the season, it would seem churlish to overlook the man who masterminded one team’s canter to the title. The choreographer of some of the most breathtaking football ever witnessed in the English top flight, Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City didn’t so much play, as perform what often appeared to be a completely different sport to many of their comparatively clod-hopping rivals. First, some merit badges. Few could have predicted Sean Dyche’s exceptional effort in helping a Burnley side many predicted might struggle to maintain the dizzy heights of seventh place, while not many predicted that David Wagner would keep Huddersfield above the thick black line. Elsewhere, the work of Roy Hodgson at Crystal Palace, David Moyes at West Ham, Rafael Benítez at Newcastle and – in the short time available to him – Darren Moore at West Brom, often in the face exceptionally trying circumstances, was also highly commendable.Nevertheless, in a league so desperately low on quality from sixth place down (Burnley failed to win in 11 matches either side of Christmas and still finished seventh); a division boasting so many teams with no ambition more lofty than the mere avoidance of relegation, simply keeping a team up scarcely justifies a ticker-tape parade when City were sweeping most before them. The scorelines and statistics speak for themselves: 5-0, 0-6, 5-0, 7-2, 0-4, 4-1, 4-0, 5-1, 5-0. Thirty-two wins and just two defeats. An astonishing 100 points acquired and 106 goals scored.Of course there are detractors who suggest that hitting these kind of numbers is easy when you have the ludicrously generous financial backing of City’s owners and perhaps these naysayers have a point. Nevertheless, it is an inescapable truth that those eager to belittle Guardiola’s achievements and dismiss the City boss as little more than a cheque-book manager habitually overlook the comparatively poor purchases made by similarly free-spending sides.With great wealth comes great responsibility and only the most one-eyed fans of the clubs passing for City’s title rivals this season could deny that Guardiola has spent the hundreds of millions put at his disposal exceptionally well. In his two seasons at City, he has spent £20m or more on 10 players. Of that group, John Stones is arguably the nearest thing to a poor investment. The same John Stones who is still only 23 and will almost certainly start for England at the World Cup. We can only speculate, but should City sell any or all of Stones, Aymeric Laporte, Kyle Walker, Ederson, Bernardo Silva, Leroy Sané, Danilo, Benjamin Mendy, Gabriel Jesus or Ilkay Gündoğan , they would almost certainly turn a profit or at least recoup their initial outlay.Perhaps what City’s romp to the title has demonstrated more than anything is Guardiola’s shrewdness in the transfer market is matched by his ability to take a group of excellent footballers and make them better. He has made a mockery of warnings he would be forced to adapt to the Premier League and two seasons in, City’s nearest rivals find themselves in a desperate, unseemly scramble.In assorted competitions, Liverpool, Manchester United, Bristol City and even League One side Wigan Athletic have proved City are far from infallible. Assorted “Einsteins”, including Guardiola himself, are already predicting the champions will not have it all their own way next season, basing their assumption on the notion that at least one team among the chasing posse will regroup, invest, improve and mount a serious challenge. On the evidence of this season, it would be extremely naive to presume the champions won’t return from the close season as an even more irresistible force.Occasionally chippy, sometimes rude and open to accusations of hypocrisy over the manner in which he champions the freedom of one country’s citizens while in the employment of a club whose vast wealth was accumulated on the back of slave labour, it can at times be difficult to warm to Guardiola. He is, however, far from unique among managers in that regard and all of us who have marvelled at some of the extraordinary performances of his Manchester City side on their stately procession to the title can similarly be accused of double standards. As guilty a pleasure as watching City under Guardiola can sometimes be, were we not entertained?"

When Suso arrived in Italy to sign for Milan, in January 2015, there were no fans or journalists at Malpensa airport to greet him. He was a virtual stranger, a low-key signing for a club that were no longer able to reach the heights of previous decades.The Spaniard cost Milan £1m and arrived in Italy having spent the previous four and a half years at Liverpool, a spell that included 21 first-team appearances and one goal, as well as a loan spell at Almería.It was not the signing the Milan fans had hoped for but three years later the Spaniard, now 24, is someone they do not want to lose. Suso has developed into an outstanding player, one of the best in Serie A, and he has hopes of going to the World Cup.He is a different player – and a different person – to the one that arrived in Italy and the transformation has been such that even he sometimes needs to stop to take it all in. “So much has changed. When I arrived here it wasn’t easy: I didn’t play a lot and I had to go to Genoa on loan in order to play.“Milan was always my dream: when I was a kid I watched the great players who wore the shirt and now to be playing here is incredible. I am proud to be able to play for Milan and one day I’ll be able to tell my son: ‘Your father played for Milan.’”The Rossoneri have undergone huge changes in the past few years, being taken over by Li Yonghong in April last year and investing €230m in players last summer. Despite that, they struggled initially and it was only after Gennaro Gattuso took over from Vincenzo Montella as manager in November that the team climbed the table.One day I’ll be able to tell my son: ‘Your father played for Milan.'They are now sixth in Serie A, 11 points behind fourth-placed Lazio. They lost the Coppa Italia final against Juventus 4-0 but at last there are signs that they are about to recapture their former glories.“It hasn’t been an easy season,” Suso says. “There were a lot of expectations on us but we did not start well. After Gattuso took over everything improved and we are working hard to qualify for Europe.“The club changed a lot in the last year and invested heavily in players. It’s never easy when there is such a big change. Compared with the start of the year we have improved a lot. And, importantly, there are a lot of young players at Milan at the moment, which is another reason we need time. But we are on the right path.”Suso and his team-mates have benefited from working with Gattuso, a fiery character who had mixed results as a manager before taking charge of Milan’s first team. The former Milan, Rangers and Italy midfielder had been in charge of Sion (as player-manager), Palermo, Crete and Pisa before returning to Milan to take over the primavera side, as Italian youth teams are known.Partly because of the kind of player he was, Gattuso has earned a reputation for being a great motivator but there have been questions about his tactical nous. Suso, however, paints a picture of a manager who is able to motivate, challenge and improve players.“He is very impressive,” he says. “He works 24 hours a day and only thinks about football. He likes the work, he likes all of it: after many years without playing in Europe we see the light with him. I’m certain he will be a great manager.“He has not been with us for a long time but he has already left a significant mark. Also, his charisma isn’t everything. He is good tactically, in attack and defence. He also knows how to talk to players, he always gets his point across and how a manager communicates with his players is fundamental.”Suso’s form for Milan has led to speculation that he could search for Champions League football but he is in no rush to leave the team that have made him a star. “I’m very happy at Milan,” he says. “Always when there are rumours about me leaving I reiterate that I am happy here and I think the club is with me. I have a release clause [€40m] and that was something both the club and my agent wanted. If the club wants to continue to be among the top sides and count on me then I am here for them.”Suso, born in Cádiz in south-west Spain, was scouted by Liverpool when on international duty for Spain Under-17s and left home for England as a 16-year-old. Although he was happy at Anfield, he admits that it was a big step to take at such a young age. “In a sense I became a man before I became a footballer. It was very hard with the lifestyle and language.“But to this day I remember everything. I did not play that much but I got to know Steven Gerrard and be a team-mate of players such as Luis Súarez, Philippe Coutinho and Jamie Carragher. I’ll never forget my experience at Liverpool.“Premier League football is different, I would call it special: I would like to play for Liverpool again some day. I grew up there and it is a big club.”His former club are taking on Real Madrid in Kiev in the Champions League final on Saturday and for Suso it will be a strange evening. “My heart is torn: if Real Madrid win it will make me happy because it is a Spanish team winning but then if Liverpool win I will be equally happy because it is my former club.”The Champions League is a competition the young Spaniard dreams about, having been close to playing in it when at Liverpool. He was selected in the starting XI against Basel in 2014 – only to suffer an injury in the warm-up. But he is confident he will be back. “This is an important moment in my career and next year will be even more important. I feel like I am only at 60-70% of what I can achieve.”"

Paul Lambert has left his position as Stoke City manager by mutual consent, the club has announced.The Scot replaced Mark Hughes at the bet365 Stadium in January with the brief of keeping the club in the Premier League. Stoke were 18th at the time and ultimately they finished one place lower and were relegated to the Championship having won only once under Lambert.“Stoke City can confirm that Paul Lambert has today left his position as manager by mutual consent,” said a club statement. “We would like to thank Paul for his work over the past four months and wish him well for the future. While he was unable to guide us to Premier League safety, it certainly wasn’t due to a lack of effort, professionalism and dedication on his part.“The club will appoint a replacement as soon as possible in order to give the new manager time to prepare for the challenge of the 2018-19 season in the Championship.”David Moyes and Sam Allardyce, who left West Ham and Everton respectively this week, are among those linked with the vacancy at Stoke, who spent 10 years in the Premier League having been promoted under Tony Pulis in 2008."

The United States national team will be watching the World Cup from their living rooms after disastrously failing to qualify for next month’s tournament in Russia, but in the eyes of former manager Jürgen Klinsmann it’s not for lack of talent.Klinsmann, who has resurfaced in a series of interviews this week after an extended period of radio silence following his removal as USA manager in November 2016, believes the Americans could have reached the semi-finals in Russia.“I realistically saw a group growing into the World Cup 2018 that could go into a semi-final,” Klinsmann told Yahoo Sports in an interview published Thursday.Klinsmann was relieved of his post in November shortly after the US lost successive games to Mexico and Costa Rica early in their doomed qualifying campaign. The team briefly recovered under replacement Bruce Arena and appeared positioned to qualify after earning a rare point at Mexico’s Estadio Azteca, but a stunning final-reel defeat to Trinidad & Tobago, when they needed only a draw with the world’s 99th-ranked team to secure a play-off spot, sealed their fate.Still, Klinsmann believes the United States would have managed to put the moribund qualifying campaign, where they scratched out 12 points in 10 matches, behind them in Russia: “The World Cup has nothing to do with the four years prior to that. It’s a completely new chapter.”He added: “We almost didn’t qualify for Italy in 1990 with Germany ... We had to win our last game against Wales, and I still remember that Mark Hughes missed a 100% chance two minutes before the end of the game. He had a free header and he put it over the bar. If he puts that in, we’re not going to Italy. And then we won the World Cup.”It’s possible Klinsmann’s assessment is grounded in the United States’ track record for punching above their modest weight in major tournaments. USA are one of only eight countries – along with Argentina, Brazil, England, Germany, Mexico, Holland and Spain – to have reached the knockout stage at three of the last four World Cups. They managed to halt Spain’s 35-game unbeaten streak during a memorable run to the 2009 Confederations Cup final and consistently show well in their continental championship.Still, it all feels a bit quixotic after the USA’s failure to survive perhaps the most lenient of World Cup qualifying paths, where the margin for error is as friendly as it gets.Klinsmann oversaw the national team for 98 matches following his appointment in 2011. His 55 victories, against 28 losses and 15 draws, rank second all time behind Bruce Arena’s 83. But his record against opponents ranked in the top 20 of Fifa’s world rankings – two victories, eight losses, two draws and a minus-10 goal differential – was the worst in modern national team history.The gulf in class was showcased at Copa América Centenario in 2016. Although the US reached the semi-final they were thoroughly outplayed when they came up against the best sides in the tournament, losing 2-0 to Colombia and 4-0 to Argentina.Klinsmann said he believes the Copa América experience would have served the players well in Russia.“It was so valuable to play Copa America because it gave the players a sense of where they were, that they can beat South American opponents, good teams like Paraguay, Ecuador,” he said. “I think it was really huge for that group of players.”"

Only time will tell if this highly-charged encounter will help take Fulham back to the promised land of the Premier League. But judging by the electricity that crackled round the old stands of Craven Cottage, there is momentum behind the Cottagers. And they also have Ryan Sessegnon.The teenager scored the first goal of this match and set up the second for Denis Odoi. Kept quiet for much of the game, when his moment arrived in the second minute of the second half, Sessegnon buried it.Fulham had never won a play-off match before, failing on seven occasions against the likes of Grimsby Town and Bristol Rovers. They came into this game having missed automatic promotion at the last and with a 1-0 deficit to overturn. It requires a certain strength of character to flip that kind of record around, and Sessegnon has it. He turns 18 on Friday.Slavisa Jokanovic has been forced to talk about Sessegnon many times already this season, such has been the teenager’s form, with 15 league goals and a place on the PFA young player of the year shortlist already under his belt. The Fulham manager was made to do so again after this match and he put it like this: “He is 17 and he is special. I can’t explain him. I remember what I was like when I was 17, and the level he is at at this age is fantastic. He knows very well what this profession is about; it’s focus and concentration,and he made a great job for us.”Quick to shift the focus away from a player who will surely be linked with every club under the sun this summer and may yet have an outside chance of an England call-up, Jokanovic praised the defensive resolution of his side on the night, observing quite accurately that they stymied any Derby hopes on the counterattack. But this performance was more a vindication of his side’s capabilities on the ball, which Jokanovic has been stressing throughout these past two weeks of relative stress.Making one change from the team that lost on Friday night, with the muscular Aboubakar Kamara for Floyd Ayité, Fulham dominated the ball from start to finish, just as they had at Pride Park. Sessegnon might have opened the scoring within eight minutes, only to see his lofted effort turned over the bar by Scott Carson. The former England keeper was outstanding and made his best save of the game at the very end of the opening period, turning a point-blank Alexander Mitrovic header over the bar with his right hand as he dived to his left.The match was scoreless at half-time but it didn’t feel like Derby were going to leave with a clean sheet and, within two minutes of the restart, Sessegnon made sure they wouldn’t. It came from a Matt Targett cross, the Southampton loanee finding Stefan Johansen in the box. The Norwegian got up and chested down to Sessegnon, who was mystifyingly unmarked. With one touch on his chest and the second with that dynamite left boot of his, the ball was soon lashing the roof of the net. Twenty minutes later, Sessegnon curled a corner to the front post and Odoi arced a wonderful header beyond Carson to give Fulham a leader they never looked like surrendering.Gary Rowett was generous enough to admit his side had had it coming. “It’s a difficult enough task to come here and get a clean sheet‚“ he said, “Never mind to stop them scoring for a second game.” The Derby manager criticised his team for what he saw as succumbing to the pressure of such a high-stakes tie. They struggled to create a chance of note in the match, though the absence of their top scorer Matej Vydra who was left out of the starting XI by Rowett, might have factored into that equation.For Derby that is now three play-off defeats in five years and Rowett has a tricky summer ahead working out how to take his experienced and expensive team that one extra step. For Fulham however, the dream is still alive. Craven Cottage was bouncing throughout the match, quite literally in the case of small crowds balanced precariously on balconies in the corners. The noise was not quite what you’d expect from one of the Football League’s more scenic stadiums, but maybe they felt something special was happening.“If I can find some kind of benefits the I start to be interested in statistics” said Jokanovic who had spent the past fortnight denying their significance. “I know that we haven’t played for 43 years at Wembley.“So we are really satisfied and proud. We know how important it is to get there, but it’s more important to show our quality in the final. Now we must clear our minds, rest our bodies and prepare.”"

Zinedine Zidane has praised his “formidable” opposite number Jürgen Klopp before Real Madrid take on Liverpool in Saturday’s Champions League final.The Frenchman was full of praise for the German manager, who has led Liverpool to two European finals since he took over towards the end of 2015.“I don’t know him personally, I’ve never spoken with him but I’ve seen his work and it’s formidable,” Zidane said. “He has shown it over the years, not only at Dortmund but also now with Liverpool. I respect him a lot for what he’s doing in the Champions League and Premier League.”Zidane said he expected a clash of styles in Kiev on Saturday evening. “I don’t think we play the same kind of football as a team,” he said, adding that Real would be fully prepared and did not expect any surprises.“Everyone speaks about the three up front [Roberto Firmino, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané] and says they’re less at the back, but they’re a team unit. They’ve got to the final and deserve to be there, just like us.”Inevitably talk turned to Cristiano Ronaldo and Salah but Zidane was unequivocal when asked whether he would swap the Portuguese for Liverpool’s Egyptian forward.“Cristiano is the best; he shows it every year,” he said. “Sometimes pressure gets to players and it spurs others on. He is certainly the latter. He’s of maximum importance to us.”Zidane warned Liverpool that Real are as hungry as ever to win the Champions League, rejecting claims that they might have lost their edge, having won the past two finals and three of the last four.“We always have the same desire and nobody can say we don’t,” he said. “We’re in a third final [in a row] and we have the chance to do something historic and win it three times in a row. You can’t say Liverpool have more hunger than us; it simply isn’t true. Nobody can take our hunger away from us. We’re Real Madrid ... We always want more and will always give our all to get more.”"

Rotherham’s hopes of bouncing straight back to the Championship remain alive after they booked their place in the League One play-off final with a 2-0 win over Scunthorpe in the semi-final second leg.The Millers, relegated from the second tier last year, triumphed 4-2 on aggregate after goals either side of half-time by Richard Wood and Will Vaulks at the New York Stadium.That sets up the final at Wembley against Shrewsbury on 27 May, with Paul Warne coming up against his former Rotherham team-mate Paul Hurst, the Shrewsbury manager.For Scunthorpe, who had Rory McArdle sent off in the second half, it is more play-off heartache as they fall at this stage for the second successive season and they must now decide whether to give the caretaker manager Nick Daws the job or look elsewhere.Such a routine night for Rotherham did not look on the cards. Scunthorpe were calm in possession and moved the ball well but only had Hakeeb Adelakun’s low effort, which Marek Rodak saved comfortably, to show for their dominance.Rotherham began to take control and Rory Watson, in for the injured Matt Gilks, made two brilliant saves to keep Scunthorpe level. First he did well to palm away Michael Ihiekwe’s close-range header and then did even better to brilliantly claw out Richie Towell’s curling effort, which looked destined for the top corner.Watson also kept out a low drive from Matt Palmer but he was beaten in first-half added time. Vaulks launched a long throw into the area and Wood climbed highest to nod into the bottom corner.Rotherham were oozing confidence after the restart and put one foot firmly on Wembley Way in the 63rd minute when they went 2-0 up. A flowing move ended up with Josh Emmanuel on the right-hand side and his low cross ended up at the feet of Vaulks, who fired into the bottom corner from eight yards.Scunthorpe found some life and attempted a comeback. Ivan Toney was denied a goal back by a Joe Mattock block, while Cameron McGeehan missed a golden chance when he somehow headed wide from close range. Rodak then had to be quick off his line to save from Duane Holmes before Scunthorpe’s task became harder when McArdle was dismissed for a second yellow card in the 77th minute.Still they pressed and Rodak produced a flying save to deny Holmes, his best of the match. Rotherham held firm, seeing out seven minutes of added time to spark exuberant celebrations."

Considering the vast amounts of money so many people pay to spend their leisure time at football matches, The Fiver struggles to understand why so many of them seem to hate being at them. There are infinitely cheaper ways of reducing oneself to the state of angry, snarling, mouth-foaming maniac over the course of two hours, as anyone who has ever been put on hold by [insert pertinent energy/airline/mobile/insurance company name here] will readily testify. So on a fairly pointless final day of the league season that had about it an air of “School’s Out”, The Fiver’s c0ckles were warmed by almost unprecedented scenes at Huddersfield, where a Premier League football match was staged and almost every single person present seemed deliriously happy.Terriers fans were happy, because their club is staying in the Premier League, having pulled off the admittedly not-quite-as-impressive-when-you-look-at-it feat of not being as rubbish as Swansea, Stoke and West Brom. Arsenal fans were happy because they’re finally getting rid of Arsène Wenger, who in the course of 22 years at the club brought them unprecedented amounts of silverware, but whose most recent triumph at the club involved successfully zipping up his padded overcoat. Wenger was happy, because he would no longer have to contend with the abuse and cat-calls of various ingrates, many of whom have recently been tying themselves in knots in an effort to point out that wishing somebody well for the future having spent three years verbally abusing him in the nastiest possible terms does not make one a hypocrite. And finally, local light aircraft pilots were happy as there were so many planes trailing banners that the sky over the stadium resembled a scene from Dunkirk.In other unprecedented scenes, Wenger engaged in much unWengerlike behaviour: milking applause from all four sides of the ground, bowing with a flourish and gambolling across the pitch and down the tunnel, giving it a McCartney-esque two-thumbs aloft for the last time as Arsenal manager. “I should have announced every week I retire,” he said. “People are so nice since I said that. I think what will remain is the formidable human aspect of the last 22 years – that is special and I will cherish that. I had fantastic human experiences at the club, above the results, it was a human adventure.” On Sunday Wenger found himself drenched in the milk of universal human kindness. It was uncharacteristically warm, gloopy, civilised behaviour unbecoming of a football match and The Fiver didn’t like it.Join Jacob Steinberg from 7.45pm BST for hot MBM coverage of Fulham 2-2 Derby County (agg: 2-3).“Hopeless.

At Southend, he was sacked after a mid-season run of one win in 10; had we had the foresight to get rid just two games earlier then his successor, Chris Powell, would almost certainly have got the same squad into the League One top six.

Real Madrid’s president, Florentino Pérez, said we had heard it all before but we had not, not quite like this. Sergio Ramos had not even collected the European Cup, their third in a row, when Cristiano Ronaldo referred to it in the past – to all of it. “It was nice to be at Madrid,” he said, standing pitchside at the Olympic Stadium, Kiev. Was? “In a few days I will give a response to the fans, because they have always been at my side.” And so a historic moment shifted. The night had yet another narrative.A few minutes earlier a pitch invader had stood between Ronaldo and a goal in the final, which might have helped to bring some of the sentiment to the surface but this, he later admitted, had been brewing for much longer: “When you hold on and hold on, when you have a heart and you’re honest, sometimes you lose control.” The stress on “have” as he stood by the pitch revealed that, while fans have supported him, others have not. There was a reflection of that desire for affection in the remark made by Sergio Ramos shortly after. Literally, it translates as: “Cris likes to let him himself be loved,” and it implies a want, a need, a call for attention, for appreciation.Back in Madrid, at the statue of Cibeles where they celebrate titles, he got that. There were chants of “Ronaldo, stay!” But while the fans’ relationship with him has not always been perfect, when it comes to those whose support he has missed, Ronaldo was thinking principally of Pérez, and it was Pérez who responded. “Now is not the time for individual issues; the club is more important than anyone,” he said.What came next was even more pointed. “I am glad he has five European Cups, like me.” And then he said it: “The same thing is heard every summer and then nothing happens.” They had not expected to hear it now, in the midst of celebration. They also did not expect to hear something similar from Gareth Bale, although that did feel different, Zinedine Zidane saying: “I understand him.”Ronaldo had just won his fourth European Cup with Real Madrid, his fifth in total. This is their fourth in five years. Luka Modric likened it to the Bulls, the Lakers and the Celtics, basketball teams that established a dynasty. “Now you can call this a dynasty too.”Marcelo called it a “special night” but now he was forced to field different questions. They all were. In the post-match press conference Zidane shrugged: “What do you want me to say? I can’t change what he said. But now it’s important to enjoy the moment.”By the time Ronaldo appeared again it was past 1am and that message had clearly been conveyed to him as well. “The timing was not ideal,” he conceded. He insisted he did not want to sully the moment for his team-mates, “the real champions here”, and the contrition seemed genuine. But he was not backing down.“Do you have something important to say?” he was asked. He replied: “Yes, of course; I’m not going to hide that. Maybe it wasn’t the time to say something, to get something off my chest, and I don’t want to throw away the credit that Madrid deserve, because this is something historic. But I won’t hide. I have a week now, to be calm, then I will join up with the national team on 4 June and I’ll say something. It was not the right moment and I didn’t mean to say that [then] but when you’re honest and you have a heart, things come out.”It was nice to be at Madrid. I will give a response to the fans, because they have always been at my sideThings a little like this have come out before, which is what Pérez was getting at. He did not sign Ronaldo but rather inherited a done deal and the relationship has not always been good. Ronaldo has publicly said he was “sad” before, he had felt alone at Fifa galas, during his legal battle with the Spanish tax authorities, and there have been difficulties over contract renewals. One theory is that the pursuit of Neymar has not helped, just as it did not help when Pérez once told Ronaldo that he could go if he brought them money to sign Messi instead.Before Ronaldo last renewed his contract, negotiations had often appeared at breaking point. A year ago A Bola, a Portuguese sports newspaper, claimed he wanted to leave. Ronaldo never denied it but almost three months later he did remind people that the words were not actually his. These words were. “I cannot guarantee I will be at Madrid next season.” He was swift to insist this was not about money – nor jealousy. “I have five Champions leagues, five Ballon d’Ors, I’ve been top scorer six years in a row. Who am I going to be jealous of?”Madrid know how important he is – or the players do, anyway, and so does Zidane – but at some point the club know they will have to confront a post-Cristiano Ronaldo era. His position has ramifications for Bale, too; the departure of one may help prevent the departure of the other. The question embarking on a new era is when and how. Ronaldo is 33 and Pérez is not averse to starting now but Ronaldo has accelerated since he turned 30, becoming more effective than ever.“I know what I give the club,” Ronaldo insisted. Others, he feels, perhaps do not.This has a long way to go, even if in the next few days he does, as promised, make an announcement and even if that does reveal a determination to depart, with everything that implies. Or if he announces a change of heart, a rapprochement. It might be that nothing happens, just as Pérez claimed, but this cannot play out quite like those other times; we have not heard this before.“Where would you be better off than here?” Ronaldo was asked. “Difficult,” he said. “This is the best club in the world but life is not all about glory.”No, but the moment was supposed to be. It was almost 3am when Ramos left the stadium. He dashed past journalists waiting for a word – about the final, about history, about Mohamed Salah, about Bale’s goal, now of course about Ronaldo. He hurried past, grinned, winked and nodded at the huge trophy he carried in his hands, as if to say this is all that matters. And on Saturday night in Kiev it should have been."

Harry Kane has marked his appointment as England’s youngest World Cup captain by insisting Gareth Southgate’s inexperienced side are capable of winning the tournament in Russia.Southgate confirmed to the players his decision to hand Kane the armband in a team meeting on Sunday evening at St George’s Park, though the manager had informed the 24-year-old in March. The Tottenham forward, who has 12 goals from his 23 caps, had emerged as the favourite for a role Southgate has previously shared among his senior players and will travel to Russia confident a squad boasting only five players with World Cup experience can cause a surprise.“I think we can win it,” he said. “We’re not going to be favourites to win it, we know that. But look at this season: no one thought Liverpool would get to the Champions League final. Look at Manchester United in the Sir Alex Ferguson days, with a young team, dominating the Premier League for years. It’s not really an excuse, being young. It could be a good thing. “I believe we can win it. That’s what we’ve got to try and do. Anything else is not good enough, really. I want to win everything I do, it’s in my mindset. So do the players. So that’s what we’re going to try and do. There are some really good teams in the World Cup but those dreams of lifting the trophy are worth fighting for. We’re going to fight and give everything we’ve got.“It’s part of planning for the World Cup, this pressure. You have to deal with it. We have a younger team, a less experienced team, but when we’re out there the fans will expect us to win: especially those first few group games. We expect to, too. That’s part of the experience, playing and coping with that pressure. In the past, we’ve been a bit afraid to say we want to win stuff. We’ve been afraid of the fans’ or media’s reaction. We go into our shells.“But I want us not to be afraid to say we want to win it. We have to be brave. Whether we go out at the group stage or the semi-final, it’s the same: you don’t win the World Cup. So we’ve discussed it as players and shouldn’t have any fear. We want to win it, we’ll go there and do our best to achieve that.”Kane first captained his country in last summer’s qualifying draw in Scotland, when his stoppage-time equaliser secured a point, and has had the armband in three games since. He scored five in those games to suggest the captaincy will not blunt his form as he seeks to make more of an impact this summer than he managed during a scoreless Euro 2016. “I don’t think it’ll be a distraction,” he said. “I’m extremely proud to wear the armband, but I have to go and do my job, work hard for the team, and score my goals as well.’The striker has effectively been chosen ahead of his Tottenham club-mate Eric Dier and Jordan Henderson, who is with Liverpool preparing to face Real Madrid on Saturday and has texted his congratulations.Southgate had promoted the benefits of shared responsibility since taking up the reins in qualifying – Gary Cahill and Joe Hart have also captained the team – as he sought to develop a strong dressing-room culture which would benefit England at a major finals. But it had always been his intention to make a permanent appointment for the tournament.“Harry has some outstanding personal qualities,” said Southgate. “He is a meticulous professional and one of the most important things for a captain is that they set the standard every day. He has belief and high standards and it is a great message for the team to have a captain who has shown that it is possible to be one of the best in the world over a consistent period of time and that has been his drive.“Of course, Harry will need the support of the other good leaders that we have got around him. You don’t become a top team by just having a good captain with good values because that has got to spread right throughout the group but I think he is the one who is ready to take that challenge on.”Kane added: “We don’t have a minimum requirement. It’d be silly to put that on it. We want to win. We’ve had really good teams in the recent past and it’s not gone well in major tournaments. It’s been over 50 years now since we won anything, so no matter how good our teams have been, we’ve not been good enough.“But we’ve got nothing to lose. We have to go there and be free, enjoy it. It’ll be an amazing experience, one we’ll look back on when we’ve retired. We have to give it everything we’ve got. We want to win everything. That’s our mind-set. That’s all we can do. Whether or not we do or not, we’ll have to wait and see, but we’re excited to get out there.”"

Steve Bruce speaks! “We’ve shaded it over the two games. They haven’t had a shot on target. That stood us in good stead. First half, we gave the ball away a bit. Second half, we controlled it. It was agony towards the end. But it means so much. Thankfully it seems we’ve turned the club round a bit. We have to beat a very good team in Fulham. We need a few days to rest.”

Antonio Conte believes Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when he arrived as José Mourinho’s permanent successor almost two years ago, even if they fail to secure Champions League qualification.The FA Cup finalists travel to Newcastle on Sunday retaining only faint hopes of a top-four finish, and with Conte expected to depart in the summer. The Italian had inherited a squad who had finished 10th under Mourinho and, from December 2015, the interim stewardship of Guus Hiddink, and spoke last summer about his desire to avoid enduring another “Mourinho season”.Yet, despite a difficult campaign, he has suggested his second year should not be considered a write-off. “We worked two years, and worked very hard, to try to build something, to create a base,” Conte said. “I think we did this … There are six top teams at the start of the season ready to fight for a place in the Champions League. It [not qualifying] can happen. In the past it happened. Don’t forget two years ago, Chelsea ended the season 10th and not in the FA Cup final, not in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup and they were eliminated in the last 16 against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League.”Asked whether missing out on Europe’s elite competition would hamper Chelsea, Conte said: “Last season, after a 10th-place finish, we won the league. Now, probably, you can finish fifth and start with a bit of an advantage compared to when you finish 10th.”Conte, who will attend Andrea Pirlo’s testimonial on 21 May, suggested he was in the dark as to Chelsea’s end-of-season plans. “I will go to Milan for the game for Pirlo, then we don’t know, at the end of the season, if we have friendly games,” he said. “I don’t know anything about our end of season. For sure in the next week the situation will be more clear.”  "

Pep Guardiola signed a new contract to commit himself to Manchester City for another three years and immediately warned the rest of English football that his intention was to make his record-breaking team even more formidable opponents.Guardiola has agreed a two-year extension to his present deal, which had another 12 months to run, meaning he will have until 2021 to achieve the club’s ambition of winning the Champions League for the first time.“I am so happy and excited,” he said. “It’s a pleasure to be able to work here. I enjoy working with our players every day and we will try to do our best together in the coming years.“I will focus on the desire of my players to become a better team and every day that’s what I will try to do – to improve on the pitch and improve our players. We have a young squad with an average age of 23 and we want to keep taking steps forward and maintain the levels we’ve achieved this season.”Guardiola’s decision to commit himself to a new deal means, in theory, he will spend longer managing City than he did either Barcelona or Bayern Munich.His team won the Premier League by 19 points last season, setting a number of records in the process, and his new deal will almost certainly make him the highest paid manager in English football.“Pep’s contract extension is fantastic news for Manchester City,” Ferran Soriano, the club’s chief executive, said. “We have all been privileged to witness how we have played beautiful football, won titles, broken records and reached the incredible mark of 100 Premier League points. Pep has shown this style can succeed in the Premier League in a way it has never been done before. This season has been another step of our strategic plan and the continuous effort to improve the football we play. We are very pleased with the progress.”Gareth Southgate, the England manager, also paid tribute to Guardiola’s work, describing the 47-year-old Catalan as an inspiration for the whole of English football.“Who coaches our youngest players? It’s dads and parents and the impact of seeing that Barcelona team five to seven years ago was enormous. He’s been an innovator. When I watch kids’ football now, I see them playing out from the back.“I don’t see [coaches] with heads in their hands saying ‘get it forward’. I think that’s an impact of his [Barcelona] team, with the likes of Andrés Iniesta and Xavi.”"

Ivan Gazidis met the higher-ups at Real Madrid in August 2013 with the intention of signing one player – Ángel Di María. The Spanish club would not sell and, what was more, they told the Arsenal chief executive he could not have anybody.Then Gazidis’s stars aligned. Over at the Real training pitches the club’s new manager, Carlo Ancelotti, told Mesut Özil he would not be assured of a starting place. Özil threw his toys and, rather abruptly, Gazidis was told he could take the Germany superstar, which he did.Gazidis is fond of telling the story because it has plenty of zesty ingredients, not least football’s everlasting capacity to surprise. But he tells it, more than anything, because it was a cool thing to have been a part of and, at times like these, even men in his position and with his icy temperament can be touched by a childlike excitement.Gazidis is, first and foremost, a football lover. Born in Johannesburg, he moved to Manchester at the age of four where he supported City and was an outstanding schoolboy player. Having obtained a masters in law, he pursued his career as a lawyer but the bug did not leave him. Gazidis was one of the founder members of Major League Soccer in the United States, and he worked there until 2008.The Özil deal has been one of the high points of Gazidis’s nine and a half years at Arsenal and yet the opportunistic element to it did not seem to fit with his personality. Gazidis is not an off-the-cuff operator. He is a contemplator, a deep thinker, who will calmly consider each decision from every conceivable angle. Perhaps he quickly concluded that Özil was a no-brainer; he did not have to over-analyse this one.Gazidis is primed to announce the most significant signing of his career and, as the process to appoint a managerial successor to Arsène Wenger approached its endgame last week, there was the temptation to wonder, once again, whether he was about to act out of character. The 53-year-old is, by nature, risk-averse and not inclined to roll the dice. And yet he looked set to go for Mikel Arteta – a man with zero experience of being a manager.Gazidis sounds like a marketing executive when he describes Arsenal’s determination to do things their way, even if it means going against the grain. “We zig where others zag,” he once said. They were ready to zig and then some.Something changed over the weekend and, rather than Arteta, Gazidis is now putting the finishing touches to the appointment of Unai Emery, the former Paris Saint-Germain and Sevilla manager – an altogether safer bet, despite his often volatile touchline manner. Many will say the Arsenal squad, so indulged by Wenger, need an iron-fist-in-an-iron-glove kind of guy.The club have attempted a piece of revisionism and who can blame them? There was from the outset only one outstanding candidate for the job, they say, and he is about to get it. Why, then, were discussions so advanced with Arteta that the conversation had turned to his backroom staff? On Sunday night he still expected to be offered the post.Maybe it was a fiendish attempt by Gazidis and his inner circle to throw people off the scent, to use Arteta as a smokescreen for Emery, before dashing his hopes at the last. Or maybe not. It is simply not Gazidis’s style.More likely is that, when push came to shove, Gazidis played the percentages. Emery has experience, pedigree. He is an outstanding candidate because of his body of work over 14 seasons in management, particularly at Sevilla, where he won three Europa Leagues in a row.Why is there still the feeling that Gazidis has somehow copped out; that he has taken the middle ground? Emery does not have the cachet of Ancelotti, Max Allegri or Luis Enrique while, at the other end of the spectrum, neither does the appointment fire the imagination in the same way that Arteta or Patrick Vieira might have done. Arsenal had an interest in Thomas Tuchel but he chose PSG. Now they have the man supplanted by him in Paris.The broader context to the decision-making process has been shaped by Gazidis’s experience of working alongside, or underneath, everybody’s favourite benevolent dictator, Wenger.Gazidis has long advocated a management structure that does not rest on a single point or employee because, when it fails, there is the potential for the whole thing to collapse. He has wanted a broader coalition of talented specialists greater than the sum of its parts and, for so long, his efforts were frustrated by Wenger, to whom the club’s majority shareholder, Stan Kroenke, was in thrall.Wenger had a hotline to Kroenke and he could shape or veto Gazidis’s ideas. Gazidis wanted a director of football but Wenger pushed his friend Dick Law into a position of executive-level authority. Gazidis wanted greater expertise in data and contracts and hired Hendrik Almstadt only for Wenger to say he did not want him. Almstadt ended up going to Aston Villa.Gazidis oversaw the purchase of the data analytics company, StatDNA, but Wenger was not a fan. Gazidis wanted to find a role for Arteta after he retired as a player at the club in 2016 but Wenger had warned that “you cannot create artificial positions”.A criticism of Gazidis is that he picks his battles so carefully he avoids having them at all; that he did not do enough to fight Wenger for so many years and, consequently, the club was allowed to drift. There was the sense he feared that to fall out with Wenger would be to lose his job.But, as the writing came to be writ larger on the wall for Wenger, Gazidis made his move. He said at the end of the 2015-16 season that the on-field under-achievement had to serve as the “catalyst for change” and, since then he has manoeuvred a clutch of new hires into position.Gazidis has overhauled the structures at the club, with the most important appointments being those of Raúl Sanllehí, the director of football in all but name, and Sven Mislintat, the head of recruitment. Huss Fahmy has come in to handle player contracts and Gazidis has finally realised his vision – the creation of a bespoke support system around the manager, whose role is purely to coach the first team. Emery is merely the final piece in the jigsaw, albeit the pivotal one.It was a meticulously orchestrated coup and Gazidis carried it off while showing all the respect in the world to Wenger, who has watched virtually all of his people leave the club. It has felt like a plot-line from Gomorrah, the Neapolitan mafia drama. Gazidis was not always the favourite to outlast Wenger. Now, his position looks stronger than ever.With power comes public profile and Gazidis has never been comfortable with that. He made the decision to step out of the spotlight soon after his appointment at Arsenal, fearing that no good would come from being in the headlines and he very rarely agrees to media interviews.However, when Wenger’s end-of-season departure was announced on 20 April, it was Gazidis who faced the cameras and journalists. By doing so he put himself front and centre of the club’s new era and he has stepped into the line of fire. Gazidis desperately needs Sanllehí and Mislintat to deliver, let alone Emery. Will it work? Will the various cogs click?Gazidis was always going to be judged on The Succession and he has handled part one well enough, even if it was difficult to ease Wenger out and sell it as a mutual decision. The outpouring of love for the Frenchman came to hold sway. Now, part two looms. This is where it gets really interesting."

For years, it was the most authentic experience Major League Soccer had to offer. In many ways, they were US soccer’s marquee club. The usual derision thrown at American teams, the kind that mocks the plastic rivalries and contrived narratives of a soccer-sphere still establishing itself, never stuck on the Seattle Sounders with their decades of history and average home attendance of over 40,000 fans. They set the precedent for what a soccer team could achieve in the States.Making it to the MLS Cup final in back-to-back seasons, winning their first championship in 2016, underlined the stature of the Seattle Sounders. But despite that second MLS Cup final appearance coming just five months ago, a lot has changed. An insipid start to 2018 has seen a groundswell of frustration that had been bubbling under the surface for quite some time. The club is on the brink of a supporter uprising.While disappointing results have been a factor, this unrest has its roots in much more fundamental issues. As some fans see it, the ambition that once saw the Sounders sign a peak Clint Dempsey in a watershed deal for both the franchise and the league has dissipated, encapsulated by comments made by general manager Garth Lagerwey this month. “I think the days of Seattle being the biggest spender in the league are probably behind us,” he said.It was what many supporters feared to be their club’s party line behind closed doors. Lagerwey went on to suggest that Seattle could no longer compete with teams in bigger markets, expressing his view that “the landscape is shifting, it’s changing, and it forces us to be more efficient with some of our decisions, a little bit more strategic.”For many, terms like “more efficient” and “more strategic” read as “cheaper.” This admission from Lagerwey prompted a backlash from some sections of the Sounders support, with the man himself eventually admitting that he “screwed up”. His backtracking did little to appease a wound tight fanbase, though. “The reaction was born out of a larger sense that the Sounders just aren’t doing as much to compete as they once were,” explains Jeremiah Oshan, host of Sounders-focussed podcast, Nos Audietis. “I don’t know if I agree with that sentiment, but Lagerwey didn’t exactly deliver the latest package of frustration with much care.”No fan wants to hear that their team will no longer spend big on players. But perhaps Seattle are looking at how the New York Red Bulls implemented a similar strategy following the introduction of the glitzier, more glamorous New York City FC to MLS in 2015. Thierry Henry was never replaced, with the club focusing on bringing through young talent instead. But they have remained successful, winning the Eastern Conference in each of the two years that followed Henry’s exit, also lifting the Supporters’ Shield in 2015.Some fans see this. “We saw the success Garth had with this at Real Salt Lake,” says Cameron Collins of the Gorilla FC supporters group. “It just takes years to build, so we have yet to see the benefits of it here in Seattle. Because of that, many of the fans are okay with mortgaging the future of the club by signing a DP now who may not be the best fit, and who may leave the club hamstrung when trying to make other moves. My hope is that the fans trust in the system being built and see that the club is trying to create success for years to come. It’s not worth throwing that away in the name of a quick fix now.”All this feeds into a wider discussion around the role of the Seattle Sounders as soccer in the United States and Canada moves into a new era. The introduction of the two Cascadia rivals, Seattle and Portland, was a landmark moment for the development of the league. The Sounders in particular signalled a shift into the third phase of MLS’s development but now, it almost feels as though they have been left behind by the growth they helped push along.Atlanta United and Los Angeles FC have taken MLS to new places, particularly in the case of the former who have replaced Seattle as the seething hotbed of the American game. The sight of 70,000 fans performing the Viking Clap, giving Atlanta United the highest average attendance in MLS in their expansion season, has at least made the CenturyLink Field experience that little bit less novel.From that has born an insecurity in some Sounders fans. “The Sounders are not the team who are the focus of so much outside attention and as much as many of us find that to be a relief, there are others who I think miss being the envy of everyone else,” says Oshan. Indeed, the viral videos of sell-out crowds, of jaw-dropping TIFOs, are not from CenturyLink Field anymore. They’re of a packed out Mercedes Benz Stadium, of ‘The Wall’ at Orlando City games and even of LAFC’s shiny new Banc of California Stadium, with all its mod cons and fancy bathroom fixtures. Seattle is no longer the front MLS puts on for the world.The poor start to the 2018 season isn’t necessarily a reflection of the wider problems the Sounders are facing. Injury has struck down a number of their key players, with Clint Dempsey struggling for fitness, Nicolas Lodeiro suffering a foot injury and Jordan Morris potentially out for the rest of the season. So far, they have been denied the chance to build any sort of rhythm. Will Bruin says Seattle have become “too predictable,” while head coach Brian Schmetzer has confessed to being “pretty frustrated” at the way things are going for his team at the moment. He and about 45,000 home fans.But these are sporting problems, things that can even themselves out over the course of a season, especially one with a playoff format. There is a more fundamental debate taking place at the Seattle Sounders right now, one that concerns the identity of the club as a whole. The crowds still turn up at CenturyLink Field like they always have, despite their poor start there’s still just six points between them and the playoff places, Seattle remain an MLS superclub. But for some, that’s not enough."

Welcome to theguardian.com review of the 2017-18 Premier League season. We have nominated some contenders for this category but this is just to get the discussion going: offer your suggestions below the line …Jürgen Klopp said it best, even if the NBCSN commentator had to apologise for the German’s exemplary deployment of the F-bomb. “You can have a look at this game in different ways,” summarised Klopp after the final whistle brought an end to a wild drama in which Liverpool hit three goals in nine minutes before clinging on frantically to inflict City’s first league defeat of the campaign. “You can look at it as a manager and say ‘OK, we could have done this or that better.’ Or you can have a look at it as a football fan and say ‘What the fuck was that?!’ It was unbelievable. This was a historical game you will talk about in 20 years … people watched this game all over the world and this is why — take your heart, throw it on the pitch and play like this, both teams.”A game of two halves and four teams. Brilliant City swept aside Woeful United to run up a two-goal lead and lay one hand on the title. Then Wonderful United appeared for the second period and blew away Brittle City. No one personified the transformation more than Paul Pogba, invisible in the first half and unstoppable in the second. It only delayed City’s coronation by a week, and United lost at home to West Brom in their next game, but this match gave United fans a tantalising hint of what they could become and City showed how far they still have to go.City did not have to lose to be involved in a classic. This was an awesome demonstration of the success of their evolution since last season. They looked complete, with Benjamin Mendy such a force down the left that it felt tragic when he was struck down by injury a short time later. Watford went into the game in decent form and did not play badly, nor did they have a man sent off as Liverpool had done when losing 5-0 to City a week earlier, but they were torn apart. Sergio Agüero scored an exquisite hat-trick – his third goal was one of the season’s best – the striker skittering past three defenders before guiding the ball past the goalkeeper and into the corner from an acute angle.Chelsea were the reigning champions, Burnley had not won a single away match in their previous league campaign. Naturally, then, on the opening day of this season Sean Dyche’s side raced into a 3-0 lead, with Sam Vokes netting twice and Stephen Ward lashing a ferocious volley into the top corner. Chelsea, reduced to 10 men when Gary Cahill was sent off in the 14th minute, were in the state that Antonio Conte had warned about when complaining throughout the summer, limp and disjointed, the exact opposite of a tight Burnley team who would continue surpassing expectations for the rest of the season. Chelsea threatened to mount a comeback in the second half but lost their heads while Burnley held firm and came close to increasing their lead when Robbie Brady hit a post. Cesc Fàbregas became the second home player to be dismissed when he made a daft lunge towards the end of a dramatic contest.A sodden pitch, action and errors throughout, two late turn-around goals before a controversial stoppage-time equaliser and foul-mouthed recriminations at the final whistle … are what English football’s festive period is all about. In what was already being described as a relegation six-pointer James Collins headed the visitors in front in the seventh minute but Dan Gosling and Nathan Aké crashed in goals to put Bournemouth back on top. The hosts spurned several chances to increase their lead as West Ham seemed to be in danger of being blown away on the seaside. Marko Arnautovic did not seem himself – maybe because the name on his jersey read ‘Arnoutovic’, but he changed shirt at half-time and came to the party just before the end, firing in two late goals to swing things in West Ham’s favour. But in the 93rd minute Aké send a header towards goal and Callum Wilson helped it over the line from close range – with his arm, according to furious West Ham players and staff."

Manchester City have cleared the way for Manchester United to revive their interest in Gareth Bale as the Premier League champions are not interested in signing the Welshman.Bale could depart Real Madrid this summer after he signalled his unhappiness at being dropped by Zinedine Zidane, the head coach, for the 3-1 Champions League final victory against Liverpool in Kiev.Bale scored Real’s winning goals after coming on as a substitute with the match at 1-1. It is understood the 28-year-old is not a potential target of the City head coach, Pep Guardiola. United, though, closely monitored Bale last summer before José Mourinho conceded he would stay at Real on the eve of United’s Uefa Super Cup defeat by the Spanish club in August.Bale’s injury record at Real has been a factor in his losing his regular starting berth under Zidane but this is not of concern to Mourinho or United’s medical department.The player’s representatives will have talks with the Real president, Florentino Pérez, as he remains unsure if his Champions League-winning display has convinced Zidane of his worth.After entering as a 61st-minute replacement against Liverpool the first of Bale’s strikes was an overhead volley. Bale had scored five times in his five appearances before the final and ended the season with 21 strikes in 39 matches.Pérez wields considerable power at Real yet whether Bale remains at the club may depend on Zidane changing the stance that he is no longer an integral part of his plans.If Real had lost to Liverpool the 45-year-old might have lost his job and Bale’s long-term prospects at the club would have appeared brighter. Given Zidane became the first coach to secure a hat-trick of European Cups he seems unlikely now to leave."

Fabian Delph has been given permission by Gareth Southgate to fly home from the World Cup to be at the birth of his third child, and the England manager will allow Phil Jones to do the same and be with his own pregnant wife should he wish.Delph’s wife, Natalie, is due on 30 June, two days after England play Belgium in their final group game in Kaliningrad. The Manchester City player has discussed the situation with Southgate.“Gareth’s been absolutely fantastic,” Delph said. “There’s not just me, there’s Phil Jones as well – I think his wife’s expecting. There’s nothing more important than family to me – it always comes first and always will. If I do have the opportunity to get back [home], I will. But if not, she’s tough, she’ll deal with it. We’re not 100% certain [what will occur] – but because the game is on the 28th there might be an opportunity to fly back and then get back fast.”Delph was called by his wife about another matter after he forgot to bring an essential item to England’s St George’s Park training base. “I met her when I was at Leeds – she’s from Yorkshire so there’s only Yorkshire Tea bags in my house but I forgot them. She rang me saying: ‘You’ve forgot your tea bags.’ One hundred per cent, I will take them to Russia.”Delph’s selection by Southgate was a fitting bookend to a personal season of triumph after Pep Guardiola nearly sold him to Stoke City last summer, and he finished with a Premier League winners’ medal. The 28-year-old made 29 appearances in all competitions, becoming Guardiola’s first-choice left-back after Benjamin Mendy’s serious knee injury in September.“It was tricky for me at the start, because I wasn’t sure where I was going to be club-wise, and there was a lot of talk about me moving on and whether I was going to stay,” said Delph, who is listed by Southgate as a midfielder but emphasised that he is happy to play anywhere.“But I managed to stay at Man City. It was unfortunate for Benjamin Mendy, because there were big hopes surrounding him and with him playing in the team it would have been a different style of football, an exciting style.“But I managed to sneak in there at left-back and managed to get quite a few games. I played there as a young kid but not many times. I played there probably one or two times under Gérard Houllier at Aston Villa, but not really.”Delph joined City from Villa in July 2015 after performing two U-turns, first reversing a decision to leave, then changing his mind again.“I was fully committed to staying at Aston Villa,” he said. “The reason I didn’t was because the signings we were going to bring in to strengthen to guarantee we wouldn’t be fighting relegation – that never happened. The opportunity to go and win the Premier League, to compete in or win a Champions League, was too big an opportunity to miss.“It obviously didn’t go down well because I came out and said I was staying. I spoke to the club and the club came out with a statement and it’s okayed [but] a lot of stuff got mixed up. I’ve never had the opportunity to come out and speak about it. The situation basically was, for three or four years, I was fighting week in, week out to help the team not get relegated and it takes its toll on you.“For me it was the fact that staff would lose their jobs – I had a great relationship with them, the kitchen staff, kit men, cleaners, absolutely everyone. I loved the club so for me to then go was hard.”"

Gary Rowett has asked Derby County for permission to speak to Stoke City regarding their vacant manager’s position.Rowett is highly regarded at Stoke and was a strong contender for the manager’s job four months ago, after Mark Hughes was sacked. Stoke, however, were left frustrated on that occasion and turned to Paul Lambert, who was unable to steer the club away from relegation, winning only two of his 15 matches, which prompted the Stoke board to let him leave on Friday.Stoke are determined to return to the Premier League at the first time of asking and Rowett, who knows the Championship well, could be trusted with the task of delivering promotion. The 44-year-old impressed during his time as Birmingham City manager and he led Derby County into the play-offs this season.He signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract with the club in January but is now keen to move away from the iPro Stadium.“Derby County can confirm that Gary Rowett has asked for permission to speak with Stoke City regarding the vacant manager’s position at the bet365 Stadium,” read a Derby statement. “The club is now in discussion with Stoke and will update our supporters in due course.”Stoke would have to pay sizeable compensation for Rowett, who started his managerial career with Burton Albion, and it remains to be seen how hard Derby would try to keep him."

A hat-trick at the weekend and a total of eight goals in his last 13 matches have not been enough to keep alive Jamie Maclaren’s hopes of representing his country at the World Cup in Russia, with Socceroos coach Bert van Marwijk cutting the striker from his preliminary squad of 32 before heading to a pre-tournament camp in Turkey.Maclaren, who has five international caps to his name, is Australia’s most in-form striker, most recently scoring three times for Scottish Premier League side Hibernian – where he is on loan from German second division club SV Darmstadt 98 – in a 5-5 draw with Rangers on Sunday. But the former Perth Glory and Brisbane Roar player hinted post-match that he already knew his season was over.“Hat-trick on the Final day! Loved being apart of this special group of lads... time to switch off from Football and enjoy a holiday,” he wrote on Twitter.Van Marwijk informed players late last week whether they will be included in a 26-strong group to prepare for the tournament at a camp in Turkey. The Dutchman will then select his final squad of 23 for the tournament in Russia by a deadline of 4 June. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every dayThe omission of Maclaren gives Australia fewer options up front and raises questions as to where they will find goals from once their campaign gets up and running against France on 16 June. Tomi Juric – who has found the back of the net for FC Luzern just twice this year, and seven times all season – is likely to lead the line while veteran Tim Cahill – who is lacking both goals and playing time since leaving Melbourne City and landing at Millwall – is set for a bench role.Bailey Wright and Alex Gersbach were also axed along with Apostolos Giannou, Mitchell Langerak and Aleksandar Susnjar as Van Marwijk confirmed his selections on Tuesday.The dependable Wright, who was a regular member of Ange Postecoglou’s squads, can also feel hard done by. The Bristol City captain played in 12 of Australia’s 22 qualifiers, including both play-off legs against Honduras. But having done the hard grind, he has been overlooked in favour of more mobile options after struggling badly when employed as a right-back in the 4-1 loss to Norway in Oslo.Van Marwijk admitted the decisions were not easy. “It is always a challenging task to reduce a squad, however this is the nature of professional sport at the highest level,” he said. “Overall, I believe we have named a strong and ambitious squad.”Daniel Arzani, Dimitri Petratos, Josh Risdon, Josh Brillante and James Troisi are the only A-League players to be included. But for every hard luck tale there is a feel-good story. Danny Vukovic can look forward to a first World Cup at the age of 33, while 36-year-old Brad Jones will also attend after pulling out of the 2010 tournament after his son was diagnosed with leukaemia.Those free of club commitments will head to the Turkish resort of Antalya where they will begin an intense training camp, which includes a friendly with Czech Republic in Vienna on 1 June. Australia’s last pre-tournament hit-out will be against Hungary in Budapest on 9 June.Should they make the final cut, Cahill and fellow veteran Mark Milligan are in line to attend their fourth World Cup – with Cahill scoring at the previous three.“I am sure that in training in Antalya, and in our match against the Czech Republic, we will see players pushing to go to a higher level as they compete for a place in the final squad,” Van Marwijk said.Goalkeepers: Brad Jones, Mat Ryan, Danny VukovicDefenders: Aziz Behich, Josh Brillante, Milos Degenek, Fran Karacic, Matt Jurman, James Meredith, Mark Milligan, Josh Risdon, Trent SainsburyMidfielders: Jackson Irvine, Mile Jedinak, Massimo Luongo, Aaron Mooy, Dimitri Petratos, Tom Rogic, James TroisiForwards: Daniel Arzani, Tim Cahill, Tomi Juric, Robbie Kruse, Mat Leckie, Andrew Nabbout, Nikita Rukavytsya"

Chelsea celebrated being crowned Women’s Super League One champions with a game to spare after racking up their fourth successive win. The jubilant scenes on the pitch at full‑time made particularly splendid viewing for Emma Hayes, with the Chelsea manager, who is 35 weeks pregnant with twins, watching the victory over Bristol City from the comfort of her own home.Between popping the champagne corks and holding aloft the trophy – their second in 11 days after victory in the FA Cup – Chelsea made sure Hayes was part of it.“Her spirit was here, we Facetimed her as soon as we could and she was in bed, very excited,” Eni Aluko, the Chelsea forward, a late substitute in the 2-0 win, said. “For Emma to have led this team to a double pregnant I think says everything about her character and who she is. It’s a great message to all women around the world, in whatever they are doing, that women can do it.”Drew Spence’s first-half header and a Jonna Andersson strike were enough to seal the title in a game from which they required only a point; simply avoiding defeat was always going to be enough on a balmy evening in Bristol. Chelsea were never really required to turn on the style and, an early Millie Farrow effort aside, they never looked like ceding the chance to seal the crown.Chelsea had stormed to a 6-0 win on the opening weekend of the season in the reverse fixture but the Vixens were determined to prove they are a totally different animal these days – they had won their past two league matches, against Everton and Yeovil Town. In the end Chelsea’s class shone through, with the retiring captain, Katie Chapman, particularly influential.For Chelsea, who also reached the Champions League semi-finals, this sealed another double to go with the one from 2015, and they in turn ousted Manchester City from the throne this time around. “It’s an amazing achievement, we’ve done it again,” Aluko said. “Two doubles in three years is amazing. I am filled with pride; this team has gone up another level this season. I’m just so proud of my team-mates, the club. This team expects silverware and we’ve delivered it.”In Hayes’s absence her assistant Paul Green led the team alongside the first-team coach, TJ O’Leary, and he revealed they were in contact with the 41-year-old throughout. “She was glued in watching at home, occasionally on the phone to give her opinion on things, through one of the coaching staff,” Green said. “She was heavily involved as normal and I’m delighted we have delivered the double for her, given all her hard work. It’s special circumstances, medical teams wouldn’t allow her to travel to our last two away games but I think she’s done brilliantly well to get to this point. The players took care of themselves really.”After the final whistle Hayes tweeted: “Get in. A pleasure to watch that from home. Champions of England, we know who we are.”The trip to Prenton Park to face Liverpool on Sunday will provide her team with a chance to toast a brilliant double-winning campaign and to finish the 18-game WSL 1 season unbeaten. Victory here ensured a fifth trophy under Hayes – and a second in quick succession after sealing the FA Cup against Arsenal at Wembley.In truth Chelsea never looked like losing, with the quality of Ramona Bachmann, the Swiss winger, and Fran Kirby, the PFA player of the year, shining through. A sloppy backpass by Millie Bright afforded Farrow, the former Chelsea striker, a great chance inside five minutes but she poked wide.That jolted Chelsea out of cruise control. Bachmann combined with Spence early on, the latter heading wide before a similar move resulted in the opening goal after 11 minutes. Ji So-yun swept a ball into the box from the right and found Spence, who glanced her header into the net, beyond Sophie Baggaley, the City goalkeeper, who will have been disappointed not to keep it out. After a slow start, that goal settled any nerves, with Chelsea finding their stride.After the break Gemma Davison, another Chelsea substitute, added further guile in search of a second, which came two minutes from time through Andersson, at the end of a low-key second half. Maren Mjelde, the Chelsea defender, made a bruising but fair challenge on Lauren Hemp, while Hedwig Lindahl was forced into a smart stop to deny Liv Fergusson, The City head coach Willie Kirk’s first roll of the dice, a leveller. “We made it difficult for them tonight and we actually had chances to take the lead,” Kirk said. “It was fine margins and we didn’t take our chances.”But when Kirby danced along the right flank, it spelled danger. She picked out the on-running Sweden defender Andersson and, with a rasping shot from distance, Chelsea had wrapped up the title."

The conclusion to a second season at Celtic for Brendan Rodgers delivered the manager’s finest moment. If Rodgers was not revered by Celtic’s followers before, he will be now. This now famous Celtic side, under the guidance of the 45-year-old, has marched into the history books – again and with consummate ease.Jock Stein could not return successive domestic trebles when in charge of Celtic. Neither could Martin O’Neill. No Scottish side had achieved back-to-back clean sweeps until this sunny afternoon on Glasgow’s south side, when Motherwell were left chasing shadows. Sometimes football really is blissfully simple; this encounter perfectly encapsulated what should happen when a dominant force meets the side who finished seventh in the top flight. Any sense that Celtic’s support are growing bored by their monopoly was undermined by the scale – and sound – of their celebrations here.Rodgers, whose career in management lacked tangible reward before the arrival at his boyhood heroes, has now won six domestic trophies from a possible six. But for the European stage, where Celtic have struggled to make an impact under the former Liverpool manager, Rodgers would be running out of targets. Steven Gerrard’s imminent arrival at Rangers has generated considerable interest but the chasm between Celtic and the rest in Scotland should not be underplayed. Occasions such as this only highlight as much, and Rodgers warned he wants more from his team.“I need to push them even harder next season, there is no doubt about that,” said Celtic’s manager. “They don’t get too many pats on the back: this is our job; we are here to win. I think we can be better. We dropped too many points this year, especially at home.“After a successful season like last year, it is easy to go timed and soft. That’s something I was very aware of. It isn’t the punches to the head and the body that stop you, it’s the pats on the back. So we have to continue to work. We’ll go away, recover and come back with big motivation in the summer.”The outcome was apparent from the early stages. It was wholly fitting that Callum McGregor not only set Celtic on course for victory but remained a prominent figure as Motherwell gasped desperately for air. McGregor’s career was not exactly stagnating before Rodgers took office but the improvement in the midfielder has been stunning.There is a legitimate argument that the development of McGregor, James Forrest, Tom Rogic and Kieran Tierney has been far more of a Celtic success story for Rodgers than what he has derived from the transfer market. McGregor was curiously omitted from player of the year lists; there have been few, if any, more consistent players in Scotland this season.Motherwell’s manager, Stephen Robinson, can cite sloppiness in Charles Dunne’s 11th-minute clearance. Still, McGregor had work to do when pouncing on the ball 20 yards from goal. The 24-year-old displayed wonderful technique to slam a half-volley into Trevor Carson’s net via the inside of his right post.Motherwell had not been comprehensively outplayed by this stage but their plan was always likely to collapse with the loss of the opening goal. Their task was to become even more stern before the interval as Olivier Ntcham, now an integral part of Rodgers’s plans after a slow start upon arrival from Manchester City, collected a layoff from Moussa Dembélé before drilling a low finish beyond Carson. With just 25 minutes played, it was impossible to ignore the sense that this tie was over.Motherwell were afforded an opportunity in the 28th minute that they really needed to take. Curtis Main, handed a rare sight of goal as Celtic’s central defence dozed, blazed high over Craig Gordon’s crossbar.Celtic should have been 3-0 up by the interval, Rogic instead putting a tame effort into Carson’s hands.Main was denied by a fine Gordon save, three minutes after the restart, as Motherwell chased salvation. Yet it was Celtic who continued to dominate the ball and, in turn, the match. Rodgers and his players appealed in vain for a penalty as Dembélé tumbled under a challenge from Tom Aldred. The France striker subsequently fired wide from close range, Forrest having created the chance. Dembélé’s next chance saw Carson produce a stunning save to thwart a header.To their credit, Motherwell did not curl into a submissive position and finished on the front foot. Chris Cadden capitalised on slack play by Scott Brown before charging towards the Celtic penalty area. Dedryck Boyata hauled Cadden back, a yard from where a spot-kick would have been awarded. Gaël Bigirimana cracked the resultant Motherwell free-kick against the bar and their chances faded.In what may well be his final Celtic appearance, the excellent Dembélé was denied the goal he appeared desperate for. Another winner’s medal will serve as reasonable consolation. Rodgers has made the receipt of silverware a Celtic formality.The manager said the significance of Celtic’s achievement will take a while to sink in. “It’s an historic day for everyone that is here,” he added. “For us to be the first team to do this is a real privilege and really special.”"

Memories of Dejan Lovren’s last Champions League encounter with Real Madrid and the similarities with Saturday’s final might once have caused him to wince. Today they inspire only belief. “If I see fear in a team-mate’s eyes I will slap him and say: ‘Come on,’” the Liverpool centre-half explains. “But when I look in their eyes now, the young lads and the experienced lads, they are full of confidence. We are not in the final without a reason.” Kiev is an opportunity for Real to see how far Liverpool have come.The Spanish club were the European champions with a forward line of Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema when they handed Lovren and Liverpool a lesson at Anfield in October 2014. The strikers, two of seven Real players that night who could start in Ukraine, both scored as Brendan Rodgers’ team trailed 3-0 by half-time. Liverpool stemmed that onslaught but it was a hugely underwhelming European campaign that is remembered for Rodgers surrendering before the return at the Bernabéu, where he put Philippe Coutinho, Steven Gerrard and Raheem Sterling on the bench in readiness for a league game against Chelsea that also ended in defeat.“The only thing that is similar is the name, Liverpool,” says Lovren, who was omitted from the 1-0 defeat in Madrid. “When you look at the players and everything, we have changed a lot. I think me and [Jordan] Henderson are the only players left who started against them that night at Anfield [Alberto Moreno too]. I am so much more confident in the team now than I was then. I feel the team is ready to battle against every team in the world. We showed that against Man City. Man City showed all throughout this season that they are one of the best teams in the world but they came up against Liverpool. We are a totally different team and nobody played a team like us. Real Madrid didn’t play against us then like we play today. Maybe they are used to this team and they look at images from this game but we are totally different now.”Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool may have closed the gap in class with Madrid but, as four years ago, Lovren believes Real enter the final as favourites, though the Croatia defender offers the proviso that that mantle is based on recent history, not form.From day one up until the final we deserved to be there. Let's make it beautiful until the endThe 28-year-old says: “I prefer that we are the underdogs than the favourites. Even now, in this moment, I would say Real Madrid are the favourite because of their previous experience. You really need to respect a team that has reached the Champions League final three times in four years. We know how hard it is to get to the final – you need to beat everyone and all the best teams to get there and they are not there without a reason.“Do they deserve to be there or not? They won against Juve and they won against Bayern Munich with some decisions that you can talk about but in the end they are still in the final. As some of their players have said, they don’t care how they got there – the most important thing is they got to the final. You don’t need to play the most beautiful football in the final. You just need to win it. And this is how they are doing it.”Few would dispute that Liverpool have played the better and more beautiful football en route to this final. It may not guarantee victory on Saturday but it is why there will be no inferiority complex against a Real team bidding for a third consecutive European crown.“Definitely, definitely,” concurs Lovren when Liverpool’s superior European form is mentioned. “Maybe Bayern Munich against Real Madrid, they played some really nice football, but when you look at the competition in total we definitely deserve to be there. I hope it is our time because from day one up until the final we deserve to be there. Let’s make it beautiful until the end.”Klopp has lost his past five cup finals. “Of course you ask yourself: ‘Is it really possible to lose it again?’” Lovren says. “But in football you never know. When you look at all the teams Klopp has managed they are all really different. Maybe they have a similar style but they are different players. If you asked me a year ago or two years ago, then I would say Real Madrid really deserved to win the Champions League. But when I look at the situation now and look at who plays better, it is definitely Liverpool. Because of how we showed the quality in many games people talk like: ‘You will win it, you will win it.’ Of course it’s not easy to say that but I am really confident we will give everything in the final.”Lovren has enjoyed a fine Champions League campaign for Liverpool, which is not always a popular opinion to express, with his partnership with Virgil van Dijk a major factor in the knockout phase while the front three have dominated the goals and the headlines. A European Cup winner’s medal would be testament to his improvement and refusal to give in to often fierce criticism.Asked how he has retained belief throughout a testing Anfield career, Lovren replies: “Your words. When you say I am not good enough I will just show you I am good enough. Simple as that. At 12 years of age I wrote down: ‘One day I will be one of the best defenders in the world.’ I wrote it under my table in my apartment in Croatia where I grew up and where I did my homework.“People laughed at me. They mocked me at school and said I could not play like a defender, that I don’t have a left foot, that I am not quick enough. All these small things pushed me to be better. I struggled a lot in my life from day one but you know there is belief within me and it will never go from me. It is always there, especially now.”"

Stewart Donald, the new owner of Sunderland, has raised the startling possibility of Chris Coleman returning as manager after revealing he will pay Ellis Short £40m for the now League One club over the next two years.The former Eastleigh owner, speaking for the first time since the Football League ratified his takeover, said that all previous debts had been erased and Sunderland would benefit from a “pretty hefty” third tier transfer budget. He then proceeded to refuse to rule out the chance of Coleman making an extraordinary comeback.“The budget’s going to be pretty hefty for League One,” he said. “It’s going to be a lot more than any of the teams that got promoted last season had. I’m sure it’s a budget one or two Championship clubs would like.”As a key part of his manifesto for change, Donald hopes to name Sunderland’s a new manager in the next week but maintained he had nothing to do with Coleman’s controversial sacking in April. “That was all Ellis,” he said. “It wasn’t us and I wouldn’t rule out potentially talking to Chris. We wouldn’t necessarily exclude Chris. When I look at the list of people who have applied I think Chris would be potentially in the three or four we’d like to speak to.”It is only the second time in their history that Sunderland have fallen into the third tier and a club relegated from the Premier League just 12 months ago desperately craves a new dawn.Around £35m worth of top-flight parachute payments will help but there are concerns about the longer-term funding. Donald conceded that he is not currently backed by an international consortium but is in partnership with Charlie Methven, a public relations expert. The pair are actively seeking outside investment.Nonetheless they are adamant the agreement with Short means the new regime will start on a healthy financial note and that arrears recently understood to be in excess of £100m have been eliminated. “We’ve given Ellis £40m and in return Ellis has tidied up his debt and that’s now gone,” said Donald. “Ellis was very clear he didn’t want the debt, but we didn’t want the debt either so we refused that. Sunderland is now debt-free.”Initially Donald and Methven did not want to buy Sunderland until further investors were on board but they were eventually persuaded to act quickly. “The timescale was getting very crunched and anything that delayed the takeover was going to have a material impact on this summer’s business,” said Methven. “We took advice … and what became clear was that it would be quicker and more straightforward if the club was simply taken over by Stewart.“There are other people we both have in mind who have further capital and contacts that could be useful for the club going forward. Considerable investment is needed. This is an organisation that has become used to failure and there needs to be a quick turnaround. But Stuart will be the major shareholder whatever happens.”"

Players at this summer’s World Cup finals could be given red cards for off-the-ball incidents spotted by the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), football’s rule-making body the International Football Association Board (Ifab) has confirmed.The controversial VAR system will be used for the first time at a World Cup in Russia, with Fifa having selected 13 dedicated officials for the tournament last month.In addition to existing powers, new regulations which come into force on 1 June will enable them to alert the referee to any incidents that have been missed – even if play has restarted. That means an offender can subsequently be sent off at any time during the match.Ifab’s technical director, David Elleray, told the Times: “If there is something away from the action that has been missed and it later comes to the attention of the VAR or the assistant VAR, then they can inform the referee and he can send the player off, even if it is later in the match. We do not anticipate this happening very often … this would only be for serious red-card offences.”"

Carlo Ancelotti, the former Chelsea manager, has agreed to replace Maurizio Sarri as Napoli’s coach. The Italian, who has also managed Real Madrid and Juventus but was sacked by Bayern Munich last September, has signed a two-year deal with the Serie A club on a reported salary of €6m (£5.27m) a season.Ancelotti had been linked with the Italy national team but that post went to Roberto Mancini.Sarri’s departure from the club he guided to second place in Serie A could turn out to be the another move in the managerial carousel that sees him installed as Chelsea manager should Antonio Conte make his widely anticipated exit from Stamford Bridge this summer. However, sources in Italy say that the 59-year-old Sarri is mulling over an offer from Zenit St Petersburg, understood to be worth around £5.2m a year.It is believed that Sarri’s preference would be to join Chelsea but it is not clear that he is the club’s top target. There have been suggestions that Napoli would waive compensation for Sarri from Chelsea if David Luiz were allowed to join them for a cut-price fee, probably less than £15m.Following Sunday’s 2-1 home victory over Crotone, which saw Napoli end the season with 91 points, Sarri told La Gazzetta dello Sport: “Everything in life ends and it is better to finish things after writing a beautiful story. I don’t know if I will stay, I have to talk about it with my family.“The situation is complicated. You can’t say you’re ready to go and try again with this squad when you don’t know that everyone will remain here. I don’t know if the club will manage to keep the players who have release clauses when offers will come in from big clubs. What I do think is that I could not go directly to another Italian team, and that if I had to make a change I would prefer to go abroad.”"

“It’s hard not to think about it,” Andy Robertson says as he looks forward to the Champions League final after the Liverpool left-back has reflected for 45 minutes on his uplifting story from being a Celtic reject and relegated with Hull City a year ago to facing Cristiano Ronaldo and Real Madrid in Kiev this Saturday. “When you’re lying in bed you just think: ‘What if?’”Robertson’s freckly face breaks into a helpless smile. He has fought hard to reach this point but the 24-year-old Scot allows himself to enjoy the fleeting anticipation of Liverpool possibly becoming European champions for a sixth time with Robertson as one of their new cult heroes. “That’s natural,” he says during a break at Liverpool’s training camp in Marbella. “Real Madrid have been to three finals in the last four years so they’ll do the same.”He taps his temple thoughtfully. “But the head is the worst part of the body because it can let you wonder. It’s about making those happy thoughts a reality. Of course we believe we can win it – but we know how hard a task we face.”Robertson’s emergence as one of the stories of the season was sealed against a previously rampant Manchester City in the quarter-finals. Liverpool tore City to shreds in the first leg, with Robertson full of high-energy commitment throughout both games, and secured a 5-1 aggregate win. He was then outstanding, home and away, in the semi-final against Roma.“Everyone is nervous in these games but it’s about using your nerves in the right way. Some people shy away from it but others use the nerves in a very positive way. Against City at Anfield, all 11 of us stood up to the pressure. And in the second game we showed a side we’ve not always shown. After the worst-possible start [conceding an early goal] we defended really well and gave them no chances.”Robertson is an enjoyable interviewee because, amid Champions League fervour, he remains grounded and chockful of amusing anecdotes about how different his life was a few years ago. In 2013, while playing as an amateur for Queen’s Park and working part-time for the Scottish FA at Hampden Park, he would take telephone bookings on the phone for games and concerts. He also worked on match days.“I once showed Vincent Kompany to his seat,” he says, imagining how bemused he would have been then had he known that four-and-a-half-years later he, rather than the Belgium international and Manchester City captain, would appear in a Champions League final. “Scotland played Belgium and I was told to show [the injured] Kompany to his seat and give him a programme. He won’t remember it.”Mo Salah is the player of the season but Robertson represents another incredible bargain. Having been part of two relegated Hull teams, while winning promotion from the Championship in his middle season, Robertson was signed last summer for an initial fee of £8m. The response from Liverpool’s supporters was underwhelming. Eleven months later Robertson is an Anfield favourite, alongside Salah, and they share a hospitality box.“Mo’s family and friends have been lovely to my family. We come from completely different backgrounds but they get on so well. My family got a picture with him when Mo walked in last Sunday [after Salah had been awarded the Golden Boot].”Robertson and his girlfriend Rachel are parents to Rocco, who “will be nine months on the day of the final. Rachel was the year below me in school [near Glasgow], but we hung about with the same friends. We got together when I was 19. She always winds me up. There was a memory on Facebook from eight years ago and I wished her happy birthday just after midnight. She says now: ‘Yeah, that was you trying to get in early doors.’ Obviously, being a proud man, I denied it. But she might have a point.”Beneath the chuckling self-deprecation there are serious points to make about Robertson’s conviction. “I always believed in my ability,” he says intently. “I just had to work hard and be patient and, yeah, at times it didn’t look likely. You need a wee stroke of luck but every chance I’ve been given, I’ve taken.”Robertson was cut from the Celtic academy for being too small at 15. “If you’re let go from Celtic, the club you support, and go to Queen’s Park, people think it’s a disaster. I don’t think I cried but I was very upset. As a young boy your dream has been taken away. But I had good people around me and it was probably the best thing that happened.”Three years later, Robertson was playing for Queen’s Park in the lowest tier of Scottish professional football. “At Queen’s Park you just got your travel expenses so I found a job on the tills at M&S on Sauchiehall Street in Glasgow.”A newspaper recently dug out a Robertson tweet from just before then in August 2012: “Life at this age is rubbish with no money. #needajob.” Robertson looks embarrassed but points out: “Life is like that for many young people.”He had made his Queen’s Park debut against Berwick in the Irn-Bru Cup in July 2012, in front of a crowd of 372. “Rangers were in our division then and so we also played at a full Ibrox – 50,000 – and it was a great experience. We got beaten 2-0 but it was tight until the 87th minute. I missed a glorious chance which I’m always reminded of by old team-mates. I then got offered my first professional contract at Dundee United [in 2013]. The manager Jackie McNamara had been a great full-back [at Celtic] and he helped me.”In July 2014, Robertson moved to Hull for £2.85m. “I got off to a flyer but then I injured my ankle. I couldn’t get back in the team and we got relegated. But the Championship season was massive. Steve Bruce really put his trust in me and I learnt so much. But the gaffer fell out with the club and we went into the Premier League with 12 players. Then in January we had a wee turnaround when Marco Silva came in. He was brilliant but couldn’t keep us up.”Robertson joined Liverpool last July and recalls the impact Jürgen Klopp had on him. “When you meet a new manager you’re nervous and this was even more so because our gaffer is world famous. But he gave me one of his hugs and relaxed me from day one. The gaffer really wants to know you. I sat down with him and he told me about his past and I told him about mine. We both had to battle for everything. He liked my story and that helped.”His man-of-the-match debut against Crystal Palace won approval from the Kop. “People were doubting me but I played quite well and I think the fans took to me. But my problem was Alberto [Moreno] was playing very well. It was frustrating but I had to watch and wait.”Robertson only played three of the first 12 Premier League games and he was often not even in the squad. “The manager said: ‘We’ve got James Milner on the bench and he is so versatile. You need to learn how we play and improve defensively’. Such good communication really helped. It was unfortunate for Alberto he got injured and over the Christmas period I was the only left-back. Bournemouth away [a 4-0 win in mid-December] was a big performance. The gaffer was really happy with me.”Liverpool then went to Arsenal and a madcap game ended 3-3 after the visitors shipped three goals in five minutes. Gary Neville expressed reservations about Robertson but six months later the Sky pundit picked the Liverpool left-back in his team of the season. “He’s a great pundit,” Robertson says, “and to make his team of the season means I changed his mind.” Robertson shares Klopp’s social conscience – even if he is uncomfortable that a personal gesture to a young supporter became public knowledge. When he heard that a seven-year-old Liverpool fan had donated his pocket money to a food bank, Robertson wrote to the little boy and sent him a shirt signed by Roberto Firmino because “nobody wants the left-back’s shirt.”“It gathered pace [when his letter turned up on Twitter] which I didn’t want. The food bank is something I’ve always supported because there’s no excuse for anyone to go without food.”For his 21st birthday, Robertson asked his family and friends to donate to their local food bank rather than buy him anything. “A normal 21st birthday present is a bottle of vodka or champagne and during the season I don’t drink. At the end of the season I have a few beers with my old man. So if someone wants to buy me a bottle of vodka I’d rather they donate the £20.”It’s striking that Robertson asks me to downplay the food bank story – and a compassion that feels natural and low key to him.There will be nothing low key about Kiev. How does he feel about facing Ronaldo in the final? “It’s a great challenge but the problem with Real Madrid is that they’re all fantastic players. If you focus on Ronaldo then somebody else will pop up. But we’ll have a game plan and look at all of their strengths and weaknesses.”A year ago Robertson was facing another season in the Championship but, on Saturday night, an incredible turnaround will be complete. “Football is full of highs and lows but when people retire they often say: ‘I wish I’d enjoyed it more.’ I’m now playing at one of the biggest clubs in the world in a Champions League final. Of course there’s still that pressure but you need to enjoy it. I will.”• Main portrait by Andrew Powell"

After weeks of quiet rumblings, it is now being widely reported that the announcement that former England captain Casey Stoney will be the manager of the new Manchester United women’s team is imminent.When United revealed their intention to relaunch a women’s side and bid for entry into the new Women’s Championship (second tier) for the 2018-19 season, it was clear that the job would be highly sought after.United will not be confirming the news until the Football Association reveals the league status of the teams that have applied in the second round for the Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship, expected on Sunday. The FA have confirmed that there are up to four places available in tier one and five in tier two. With 15 teams fighting it out for those nine places, there is likely to be disquiet if United are handed a spot at the expense of a longer-established team. Yet they are not the only side who are benefiting from the changes. Other teams will be moving up, with Brighton & Hove Albion having already been granted a move into the top flight.In 2014, when the Women’s Super League structure was revamped and expanded, Manchester City were parachuted into tier one at the expense of Doncaster Rovers Belles. It is a move which still causes consternation, yet few would question the evident benefits of City’s investment in women’s football in recent years.With professional women’s football now on the cards, the introduction of a team from one of the biggest and most widely supported clubs in the world will have many positive implications, and with the women’s game very much still at the beginning of a journey, memories of the start will likely be short.How United go about setting up their team will help, and bringing in Stoney is a very smart move for the club, Stoney herself, and women’s football in England.While the 36-year-old’s managerial experience is limited to a brief spell as player-manager at Chelsea in 2009, she has slowly worked her way through her coaching badges, has led training sessions with development teams at Liverpool – where she ended her playing career – and has been vital to Phil Neville as an assistant coach in his first few months in charge of the Lionesses.Stoney knows football and is brilliant at reading the game, but she also knows the women’s game inside out. During a lengthy playing career which included spells at Arsenal, Charlton, Lincoln, Chelsea and Liverpool, she has experienced it all, from winning trophies to clubs folding. Stoney is also a proven leader having captained many of the sides she played for, alongside raking up 130 caps for England, preceding Steph Houghton as captain of the Lionesses and leading Team GB at the 2012 Olympics.United handing such a well-liked and respected member of the women’s football community, pinpointed by many as a future England manager, the chance to build a squad from scratch will earn them considerable credit. They are taking a chance on her potential and have picked her from a rumoured four-strong shortlist.They also stand to benefit greatly from her profile, both from a marketing point of view – Stoney is a role model and was one of the first gay players in the women’s game to speak publicly about her sexuality – and on the pitch. The respect she garners professionally will mean she has no problem recruiting talent to her new project.For Stoney, this is an opportunity that would be hard to rival. She has the chance to build from the bottom up, without the baggage accumulated by previous managers, at a club with resources and a top-class youth set-up already established. If United are granted the tier-two license they’ve bid for, Stoney has the profile to recruit players from tier one and abroad to balance a squad being built to not just earn top-flight status but be able to compete for trophies.There are a host of former United academy prospects who have gone on to leading clubs such as England and Manchester City midfielder Izzy Christiansen, Everton defender Gabby George, 18-year-old City forward Ella Toone, Liverpool’s Ellie Fletcher and Emily Ramsey, Juventus’s Katie Zelem and Chelsea keeper Fran Kitching, and there may well be an attempt to lure some of them back to their roots.The one down side to the potential move is the short-term loss to England. Though there can be little doubt this is a appointment that will have been supported by Neville. He will certainly miss Stoney’s experience but having her managing at what will likely become one of the biggest women’s teams in the country is something England will hopefully eventually benefit from.• Arsenal’s late attempt to unseat Manchester City from next season’s Champions League failed as the Cityzens beat Everton 3-0. Arsenal thrashed Bristol City 6-1 but finish a point behind Manchester City in third. Chelsea looked like they had thrown away the chance to finish the season unbeaten when goals from Jess Clarke and Niamh Charles saw them 2-0 down at Liverpool. Eni Aluko pulled one back - the Blues’ 100th goal of the season- before Ji So-yun scored twice to hand Chelsea victory and an invincible season.• Women in Football has launched a campaign aimed at changing the landscape for women working in the industry. The #WhatIf campaign encourages businesses and individuals to pledge a way in which they could contribute to an improvement for women and girls in the industry. The initiative was trending on Wednesday’s launch night as people tweeted their pledges, including:Sky Sports – #WhatIf Sky Sports committed to including female talent as studio pundits on Gillette Soccer Specials from the 2018-19 season onwardsTwitter - #WhatIf Women in Football had its own emoji on Twitter• England goalkeeper Siobhan Chamberlain has announced she is leaving Liverpool after two years and described the season as “frustrating”. In barbed comments, she said: “It’s important for me to know I’m in an environment that challenges me every day,” and “I also want to know I am part of a project that’s doing the most it can to develop the women’s game.”• Lyon dropped their first points of the season as they were held to a 0-0 draw at Paris Saint-Germain in their final game before Thursday’s Champions League final. Dzsenifer Marozsan had a penalty saved by PSG goalkeeper Christine Endler in the 70th minute. Meanwhile, their opponents in the final, Wolfsburg, won the DFB Pokal (German Cup) 3-2 on penalties against Bayern Munich after a 0-0 draw. Caroline Graham Hansen scored the winning kick in front of 17,692 fans. However, Wolfsburg will no doubt be ruing having to go to extra time and penalties ahead of Thursday."

Arsenal have moved to appoint Unai Emery as the successor to Arsène Wenger. The club have conducted a thorough recruitment process as they look to replace Wenger – their manager of almost 22 years – who departed at the end of the season and Mikel Arteta had been considered as the favourite for the past week or so.However, the signs on Monday were that Emery, the former Paris St-Germain and Sevilla manager, was set to be chosen. The club have spoken to him and a decision is expected to be confirmed later in the week.Emery is a safer bet in terms of his experience and, in the end, it is this factor that has swayed the decision of Ivan Gazidis, the Arsenal chief executive, who has led the recruitment drive. Arteta, the former Arsenal player, who is now a member of Pep Guardiola’s coaching staff at Manchester City, has not yet managed a club whereas Emery has been in the business since 2005, when he cut his teeth at Lorca Deportiva in his native Spain.The 46-year-old has gone on to take charge at Almería, Valencia, Spartak Moscow, Sevilla and, most recently, PSG – clubs of mounting profile – and he has impressed Gazidis, even though he is not fluent in English.The 46-year-old's managerial career began in Spain's second division and has taken him to Russia, France and major European honoursWhile Arsène Wenger is being unveiled at Arsenal, Emery settles in at Toledo in Spain's second tier after leaving his first club, Real Sociedad. Emery, a left-sided midfielder, also turned out for Racing Ferrol, Leganés and Lorca Deportiva before a knee injury ended his playing career at the age of 32.Emery is offered the manager's position at Lorca Deportiva after his knee injury, and goes on to lead the team into Spain's second division. In his first full season, Lorca miss promotion to La Liga by just five points.Emery comes to the attention of Spain's big clubs after guiding Almería to their first promotion to La Liga, and securing an eighth-place finish in the top flight. He is snapped up by Valencia in the summer of 2008.Emery replaces Ronald Koeman at cash-strapped Valencia and sets about returning the club to the Champions League. He leaves Valencia in 2012 after three consecutive third-place league finishes.The first blot on Emery's managerial copy book comes in Russia, where he lasts just six months at Spartak Moscow, and is sacked after a 5-1 derby defeat to Dynamo.After returning to La Liga with Sevilla in January 2013, Emery leads them to three consecutive Europa League titles. Sevilla beat Liverpool 3-1 in Basle to complete the hat-trick in the manager's penultimate game in charge.PSG finish second to Arsenal in their Champions League group, and then thrash Barcelona 4-0 in the first leg of their last-16 tie. On the verge of a European breakthrough, they lose the second leg 6-1 and crash out. PSG also lose out to Monaco in the French title race.Emery wins Ligue 1 and both Cup competitions in France to take his trophy haul at the club to five, but another last-16 Champions League exit leads to his departure at the end of the season.Emery is happy to work within the management structure that Gazidis has put in place at the Emirates Stadium – in which there are prominent recruitment roles for Raúl Sanllehí and Sven Mislintat. He enjoyed eye-catching success at Sevilla, where he won three consecutive Europa Leagues, and he won the championship at PSG in this past season, although his relative failure in the Champions League, in the shape of a last-16 exit against Real Madrid, cost him his job. He has been replaced by Thomas Tuchel – the one-time Arsenal target.Arteta had a meeting with the Arsenal hierarchy last week and he was confident that he would get the job. Guardiola had said he would not stand in Arteta’s way and talks had progressed to the point where the potential make-up of his backroom staff had been discussed.Arteta ticked plenty of boxes for Gazidis, who was looking for somebody to represent the club’s values, including giving youth a chance, and play fast and attractive football.Gazidis had made it clear he was not afraid to make a left-field appointment, noting on the day Wenger’s departure was confirmed that the Frenchman had not been “on many people’s radar screens” in 1996.But Emery, too, ticked the boxes and, crucially, he came to look like less of a gamble. It is understood that Arteta was told his lack of experience came to count against him. Gazidis is not a man synonymous with risk-taking. After careful consideration, analysing each argument from every conceivable angle, he has come to see Emery as the outstanding selection.The new manager is expected to have around £50m, plus money generated from sales, to spend on reshaping the squad, which is broadly in line with what Wenger was granted, annually, in recent seasons. It is not a lavish budget and it is clear that the new man’s coaching skills will have to be up to scratch from the outset.Santi Cazorla, the Arsenal midfielder, had been linked with a possible player-coach role under Arteta but he has now left the club upon the expiry of his contract. He has not played since he injured his achilles in October 2016, although he remains determined to carry on as a player.Gazidis said: “Santi is always one of my favourite players to watch. His natural ability with both feet, his speed of thought and movement were central to our best performances in recent years. He plays with a joy and freedom which is very rare. We wish him well for the future and thank him for his important contribution to our club.”"

Unai Emery declared his intention to turn Arsenal into “the best team in the Premier League and also the world” after being confirmed as the managerial successor to Arsène Wenger on a three-year contract.On a day of hyperbole, the chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, suggested the Arsenal job was the most coveted in football and made it plain that in Emery, the club believed they had the man to rekindle former glories.Emery spoke in English at his unveiling at Emirates Stadium, which was a surprise – it was decent enough – and he described the challenge in front of him as a “dream come true”.The 46-year-old Spaniard’s title is that of head coach and he will concentrate on coaching and man-managing the first-team, while Raúl Sanllehí and Sven Mislintat, whom Gazidis has appointed to recruitment positions, will oversee transfers.Emery has agreed to work within the new structure and he knows the club will operate on a £50m transfer budget next season. He suggested he did not envisage wholesale changes to the squad, which finished sixth in this past Premier League campaign. “This team is a big team, with big players, and we think we need to change little things – a few players.” he said. “The target is to be a candidate and to challenge for the title. It is very important for the club, after two years outside the Champions League, to work this way, to be the best club, the best team in the Premier League and also in the world.”Emery was asked about his style. “My idea is to be protagonists,” he said. “The history here is a team that love playing with possession and I like that personality. When you don’t have possession, I want a squad that are very, very intensive with the pressing. The two things are important for me to be protagonists – possession of the ball and pressing when you don’t have the ball.”Gazidis spoke at length about the process that led to Emery’s appointment – the starting point of which, he said, was that “every coach in the world would be interested in this position. We believe there is not a position in world football that is more attractive than Arsenal.”Gazidis, Sanllehí and Mislintat drew up an eight-man shortlist, which is known to have included the Manchester City assistant coach, Mikel Arteta, and the Juventus manager, Max Allegri. “All of those eight people were interested in the position and all of those eight people took part in extensive, in-person interviews with us,” Gazidis said. “None of them at any stage withdrew their interest.”The announcement that Wenger would step down at the end of the season after 22 years was made on 20 April and Gazidis said the interviews took place between 25 April and Tuesday of last week. The list was whittled down to three and, at that point, Arteta was the favourite. Emery was interviewed on 10 May.But, after a collective brainstorm, Gazidis said that last Friday he, Sanllehí and Mislintat unanimously agreed to recommend Emery to the board. He gave an illustration of the thoroughness when he said the recommendation was supported by a 100-page dossier that contained references, analysis, background information and videos of each of the three contenders in action on the sideline.Gazidis added that trusted, external experts were brought in to offer “unprejudiced opinions” and that, until the end, “Raúl, Sven and I spoke to each other as little as possible because we didn’t want to pollute each other’s viewpoints.”Emery met with the London-based members of the club’s board on Monday before flying to Atlanta that night with Gazidis and Sanllehí to meet the majority shareholder, Stan Kroenke, and his son, Josh. They returned on the Tuesday night red-eye. “All of the board members were energised and enthusiastic about the recommendation,” Gazidis said.Gazidis has restructured the club, particularly over the past season, and he could not have sounded more bullish about Arsenal’s prospects of success, even when it was put to him that Manchester United had struggled after the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson after 26 years. An overriding theme was Emery’s energy and the chemistry that Gazidis has felt with him.“We have a big challenge ahead,” Gazidis said. “But I feel we can face it with confidence. We’ve done an awful lot of groundwork over a number of years. So there’s been some very, very dramatic changes across the club to try to prepare for this moment and to give Unai the support he will need.“Everything in football is a risk. There are no such things as guarantees. That’s why it’s elite competition. But I have every confidence that we’ve done everything we can to give ourselves the best chance of success.”He added: “I do think the new way of working, the new energy – it’s not a criticism of Arsène – I just think that change stimulates the environment and I think it’s going to be very positive.“I could not possibly feel better about this appointment. And the feeling that myself and Unai have between each other – and we’ve spent a lot of time over the last few days together – is I feel better and better about it by the hour.”"

Mario Balotelli has urged Italy supporters to “wake up” after his goalscoring return to the national team was soured by an offensive banner in the stands.Balotelli scored in Roberto Mancini’s first game in charge – a 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia on Monday – but after had a message for supporters that appeared to display a racist message aimed at Balotelli.Fans at the AFG Stadium in St Gallen, Switzerland, unfurled a banner that read ‘Il mio capitano è di sangue italiano’ which translates into English as ‘My captain has Italian blood’. Police later removed it.Balotelli is expected to be in contention for a vice-captaincy role in the absence of Daniele De Rossi and Gianluigi Buffon, after the pair of World Cup winners recently retired from international football. Leonardo Bonucci remains the team’s captain.The 27-year-old former Manchester City striker posted a message on Instagram in response to the banner, writing: “Guys, we’re living in 2018! Wake up! Please stop with that.”Balotelli also paid tribute to the former Fiorentina captain Davide Astori, who died suddenly in March. “I know it’s late and that you’re already there … but I am convinced that you were up there watching the game with my Dad today! This goal, even if it might not mean anything, even if it’s no use to anyone, I dedicate it to you.”It was Balotelli’s first goal for his country in four years, with the striker opening the scoring after 21 minutes. Andrea Belotti, who replaced Balotelli after 58 minutes, doubled Italy’s lead before Yayha Al-Shehri pulled a goal back."

A proposal by the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, to expand the Club World Cup dramatically and to start a league for national teams, for a claimed $25bn from unidentified investors, has met strong criticism from within Uefa.Infantino, who faces re-election next year, presented the proposal in March for a new summer 24-club World Cup every four years, and a “Global Nations League” with a final eight-country round of matches, also every four years. He has told Fifa’s six confederations, including Uefa, that the investors are promising the projected $25bn for four editions of each competition over 12 years between 2021 and 2033. The investors were described as “among the world’s most solid” but are unnamed, as Infantino said he had signed a non-disclosure agreement.Infantino has held talks with seven top European clubs, including Manchester United and Manchester City, about the plan, which could promise participating clubs an average of $94m each. City and United have not commented publicly but senior representatives of Real Madrid and Barcelona have reacted positively.When the proposal was first presented to a Fifa council meeting in Bogotá, Infantino is reported to have said the investors required an answer within 60 days, a deadline that ran out this week. Fifa’s council members asked for more information and widespread objections have since been made to the plan, regarding the impact the club competition and the windfall to already-rich clubs would have on other clubs and leagues, the playing burden on top players – which Fifa believes will not be onerous – and the anonymity of the investors. The Premier League executive chairman, Richard Scudamore, has criticised the presentation of the proposals as a fait accompli and raised concerns about further pressure on players.After a meeting in Lyon on Wednesday before the Europa League final, Uefa’s professional football strategy council (PFSC) said that its members “unanimously expressed serious reservations about the process … and in particular the hasty timing and lack of concrete information”.The PFSC, chaired by the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, incorporates the European Club Association, the European Professional Football Leagues and the European division of the players’ union, Fifpro. Manchester United’s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, is an ECA representative on the PFSC and was party to the critical statement.EPFL’s president, Lars-Christer Olsson, said after the meeting: “Fifa, the governing body of world football, is selling football at great potential cost to its development, without proper consultation and no transparency. We do not know who the investors are or how they have reached $25bn, which does not add up commercially. To use an expression we have in Sweden, this is a ‘black box’.”Infantino intends to continue discussions and to secure agreement before the World Cup starts on 14 June."

Monday’s Under-17 European Championship quarter-final between the Netherlands and Republic of Ireland ended in acrimony after Irish goalkeeper James Corcoran was sent off during the deciding penalty shoot-out.Referee Zbynek Proske from the Czech Republic issued Corcoran with a yellow card after he was penalised for coming off his line while saving Daishawn Redan’s penalty. The save would have levelled the scores at 4-4 and sent the shoot-out into sudden death.The yellow card was Corcoran’s second, and the 16-year-old, who plays for Cherry Orchard FC in Dublin, was duly sent off. Team-mate Oisin McEntee put his shirt and gloves on and went in goal to face the re-take, which Chelsea’s Redan scored to send the Dutch through.The Irish team were furious with the decision, and the senior team’s manager, Martin O’Neill, left the stands to confront the referee.RTÉ’s commentators, and many fans on social media, seemed utterly perplexed at the decision. Many people focused on the fact that Dutch keeper Joey Koorevaar also appeared to be off his line for several of Ireland’s penalty kicks, including the one he saved from Norwich City’s Adam Idah.Ireland have been eliminated in bizarre, controversial fashion at the U17 Euros after goalkeeper Jimmy Corcoran was shown a second yellow card for moving off his line too early during the penalty shootout https://t.co/O48xsGehPh pic.twitter.com/yroYmS84caAccording to the laws of the game, however, the referee was entirely right to caution Corcoran. Law 10 on determining the outcome of a match has a section which covers kicks from the penalty mark, and which explicitly states:If the goalkeeper commits an offence and, as a result, the kick is retaken, the goalkeeper must be cautionedIt is, however, quite a recent change to the laws, introduced by Ifab in March 2016 in a revision of the game’s laws which were, ironically, designed to “reduce controversy and confusion”.At the time, former referee David Elleray said of these particular changes: “We will now also have stronger punishment to halt unfairness with penalty kicks: if the kicker doesn’t behave correctly during penalty kicks, and whether he scores or not it will always be a free kick. And if the goalkeeper moves too early and the kicker does not score, there will be a retake and also a yellow card for the goalkeeper.”Ireland are not the first team to fall foul of the rule change. In November 2017 Qatar’s U19 goalkeeper Shehab Mamdouh was sent off after receiving a yellow card, having made what he thought was a match-winning save during a penalty shootout.Qatar had a much happier outcome than Ireland’s young team, however. Their captain, Nasser Abdulsalam, stepped in to face the re-take, and managed to save it. The shoot-out win ensured that Qatar qualified for the AFC U19 Championship finals. Incredible scenes at Qatar U19s. Keeper saves match-winning pen ✅Ref orders retake ✅Keeper protests and is sent off ✅Captain goes in goal ✅Saves it! ✅pic.twitter.com/NsLhv0QT7VEven before the rule change, referees were always able to issue cautions and red cards during shoot-outs. In a 2003 match, Botswana’s goalkeeper Modiri Marumo was sent off after reacting badly to a pat on the back from opposing Malawian keeper Philip Nyasulu, punching him in the face.None of this will come as any comfort to Ireland, who may well feel that, while the referee obeyed the law of the game, he didn’t obey its spirit. “It was a cruel finish to the tournament,” said manager Colin O’Brien. “The referee had warned the Dutch goalkeeper twice during the shoot-out. We’ve had a really good four games. People at home should remember the football over the way it ended.”The European Under-17 Championship continues on Thursday, with semi-finals between Italy and Belgium in Rotherham, and with the Netherlands facing hosts England in Chesterfield."

Having secured our Premier League status with the great victory against Manchester United last week, myself and the rest of our squad were much more comfortable in our hotel on Tuesday evening as we sat down to watch Swansea and Southampton in their crucial match and see the effect the result would have at the bottom end of the table.As the game progressed and produced a massive win for the Saints, it not only put Swansea in huge trouble but also consigned West Bromwich Albion to their inevitable fate regardless of their outstanding resurgence under Darren Moore.The case of West Brom and especially the superb results they have picked up recently – beating Manchester United away and a strong Tottenham team at The Hawthorns – is a curious one in terms of how a manager can affect his players’ performances so critically and how, in the bigger picture of our national game, we consider and appoint head coaches.Frankly, I’m amazed we are still in the position of discussing whether Moore is the right man for West Brom in the long term because he has gained outstanding performances and results in his short tenure and the players have shown organisation, spirit and togetherness to get close to the seemingly impossible task of survival from such a grim position in the table.As a player I hear and understand the question from supporters who pay their hard-earned money, asking how it is possible for the same group of professionals to play in the way they have under Moore, when previously under Alan Pardew and Tony Pulis (both managers with huge experience) they were losing games on a regular basis without the fight, character and belief they have been displaying recently.I agree that we as players have to be accountable for our individual performances and collective results but in football, as in any other industry, the organisation, tactical plan, culture, inspiration and day-to-day training sessions are laid down by the manager, who has a huge role in defining the confidence levels, belief and spirit within the football club.These elements can make such a big difference on the field of play where instead of players having doubts about where they are heading or even being unclear of the tactical plan, they are instead being led by someone who instils confidence and belief into them and can convey their tactics and methodology concisely and clearly on the training pitch from Monday to Friday, enabling success on a Saturday.Had Moore been appointed 10 games earlier I doubt any of us, with the benefit of hindsight, would have put money on them being relegated this season. This situation draws parallels with a club in Germany two seasons ago when Hoffenheim were in a similarly desperate position to the one West Brom found themselves in, albeit earlier in the season. Staring at relegation and needing something different and fresh, they turned to a 28-year-old coach from their youth ranks to reinvigorate the team’s performances and take them forward.If you fast-forward two years, after not only an improbable “great escape” that year but consistent improvement and qualification into the Champions League play-offs, Julian Nagelsmann is one of the hottest coaching properties in world football. His short period as a manager is recognised in Germany for being innovative, intelligent and fearless – often using young German players but still being ahead of the curve in terms of the evolution of the game.I’m not saying Moore would definitely be of the same mould and ability as Nagelsmann, but why can’t he be? If we look objectively at the recent form and performances of his players the upturn has been nothing short of spectacular and I have said before that if we want our national game to improve and stay ahead we need chances to be given to our next generation of coaches who show they can do the job. Moore has proven that for sure – and in a short space of time.The wider picture of today’s game in our country and the managerial merry-go-round that is being analysed and debated by supporters and the media needs to be challenged.We talk about the increasingly difficult pathways our young players have in making first teams while we also say aspiring coaches who want to manage at the top level should play at lower-level clubs and in under-23 roles. But the sad fact is that even with success in the lower leagues or with under-23 sides these coaches are still not given a chance at the sharp end and instead we appoint “safe, experienced” managers from these shores or big-name coaches from abroad who, not by coincidence, were given a chance to shine much earlier at a higher level by more open‑minded, forward-thinking boardrooms or technical directors.Watching the emotional celebrations at the final whistle at the Hawthorns last Saturday after a last‑gasp win against Spurs I couldn’t help but think the legend Cyrille Regis was looking down from above with pride at his club.This was a man who broke down barriers in terms of prejudice with his grace, poise and skill. I hope West Brom’s directors at least give Moore the deserved opportunity to emulate Regis, having displayed the very same qualities as his hero."

Lucy Bronze has become the first England player to win the BBC women’s footballer of the year award, with Holland’s Euro 2017 winner Lieke Martens and the Australian forward Sam Kerr finishing second and third respectively.Lyon right-back Bronze takes the honour after a stellar 12 months for her country and club, whom she joined last summer from Manchester City. The award, voted for by supporters around the world, was won last year by the Norway striker Ada Hegerberg, who also plays for Lyon.“I really didn’t think I was going to win. It’s definitely special to know that fans and people are behind me,” Bronze said. “[I’m] grateful to win the award, I was very grateful even to be nominated. The people who have been nominated alongside me are really great players and had really great years so it’s really special to have won it this year.”Australian Kerr has had mixed international recognition of late, after being left out of the Fifpro world XI in March – voted on by fellow footballers – while she was also omitted from the final three in last year’s Fifa world player of the year award. However, in 2017 she won the Asian Football Confederation women’s player of the year and was named in the International Federation of Football History world XI.She was named Young Australian of the Year in 2018 and ABC Sports Personality of the Year in 2017 and the striker had a stellar 2017 as top scorer in the competitive National Women’s Soccer League in the United States (17 goals), when she surpassed the league’s all-time leading scorer with 43 goals. She was also Australia’s top scorer in their victorious Tournament of Nations campaign, a moment she names as her highlight of her last 12 months.“I came in and I’d been scoring for my club, but I hadn’t really started scoring for my national team,” she told the BBC. “That tournament just assured me that I can do it at any level. To go on and win the tournament with the Matildas – that was the moment we really believed that we could be the best in the world.”The Matildas will open their Tournament of Nations defence against arch-rivals Brazil on 26 July in Kansas City. They will then travel to Connecticut to take on the USA on 29 July, before finishing their campaign against Asian Cup winners Japan in Illinois on 2 August.Bronze said that moving to the European giants Lyon, who will face Wolfsburg in the Women’s Champions League final on Thursday in Kiev, has taken her game to a new level.“To play with all these players at such a dominant club in women’s football... It’s a great thing and it was something that I always wanted to aspire to, but you never know whether you are capable of doing it until you actually do it,” she said."

This game ended up a celebration of Roy Hodgson, with the affection bellowed by both sets of supporters. The home fans in the Holmesdale end waited until early in the second half to unfurl their banners of appreciation, with the ground then united in chorusing the former England manager’s name. He looked almost sheepish acknowledging all the adulation.West Bromwich Albion remember Hodgson fondly from his time at the Hawthorns, where he ensured survival and then consolidation over a 15-month tenure before taking up the reins of the national side. He has galvanised Palace in similar fashion, with a team who were goalless and pointless after seven matches ending the campaign outside the top half only on goal difference. The rise has been remarkable. Hodgson, Croydon-born and content in familiar surroundings, can plan progression from now.The first task will be to guard against complacency. “We mustn’t start thinking that, just because we’ve finished 11th, that’s our level,” said Hodgson. “That has only really been a product of the last three games [which were all won] otherwise it might have been us going down, and not West Brom. So we have to plan and build on this success. We need a philosophy and a clear idea of where we want this club to go.”Talks with the sporting director, Dougie Freedman, will resume this week to plan for next term, with only Damien Delaney of those players out of contract on 1 July having confirmed he will depart. There must be resolution on the futures of Yohan Cabaye, Joel Ward, Bakary Sako, Julián Speroni and Lee Chung-yong. Ruben Loftus-Cheek will return to Chelsea, leaving a void to be filled in midfield.It would take a mind-blowing offer for Wilfried Zaha for Palace to consider selling their talisman. There is no desire to sell a player who is contracted to 2022 and without whom this team did not muster a point in the 10 games he missed this season. “I understand people coveting Wilfried, but he loves playing for the club, he’s a Croydon boy and I don’t think he’s going to jump at the first opportunity,” said Hodgson. “He knows full well the last thing on anyone’s mind here is letting him go. We don’t need to sell him.”True to form, it was Zaha who eventually opened the scoring here, converting the excellent Patrick van Aanholt’s centre as West Brom struggled to reorganise after the introduction of Christian Benteke. Van Aanholt would add a second soon after, following some slick close passing in a cramped penalty area, rounding Ben Foster to score for the third game in succession.That confirmed the only defeat of Darren Moore’s caretaker stewardship of Albion, but should not detract from the impact he and his staff have made over the last six weeks. “We’ve restored pride in the football club,” said the interim manager. “We stopped the rot and offered hard work and endeavour, and even provided a bit of a feel-good factor. We’ve seen that over the final six weeks of a very difficult campaign.”Moore is a leading candidate to take up the position on a full-time basis, with West Brom hoping to confirm an appointment before the end of the week. Michael Appleton and Dean Smith have also been heavily linked."

Gareth Southgate will have his full squad available for only one pre‑World Cup friendly, against Costa Rica in Leeds on 7 June, with the England manager determined his players should have a week off after the domestic season.Southgate submitted a 35-man provisional squad to Fifa on Monday and will make public his 23-man party for the finals on Wednesday. No major surprises are anticipated with Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who played in the November internationals and has recovered from an ankle problem to impress at Crystal Palace, and the uncapped Trent Alexander-Arnold likely to feature. Newcastle’s Jonjo Shelvey is not expected to be involved.Southgate decided this year that his players should be allowed to go on holiday before the World Cup, a switch in policy from his predecessor, Roy Hodgson, who had requested clubs release members of his squad for a pre‑Euro 2016 training camp on the conclusion of the Premier League season. Players were asked to hand over their passports two years ago to demonstrate their commitment with Hodgson wary some had returned unfit after being permitted to go on family breaks before preparations began for previous tournaments.Those not involved in the FA Cup or Champions League finals have been allowed to take this week off before gathering at St George’s Park on Monday. The contingent from Chelsea and Manchester United will be granted next week off and Liverpool’s Champions League finalists will not be expected to link up until 4 June, missing the Wembley send‑off against Nigeria and ensuring Southgate will have his full complement of players available only for the game against Costa Rica.The decision to grant time off has been welcomed. “A week is the perfect time,” said Harry Kane, who has departed with his family for the Bahamas. “You stay in shape and look forward to meeting up and training hard and getting ready for the friendlies. It’s not enough time to lose a lot of fitness but it’s a good time to refresh mentally.“I’ll spend a bit of time on the beach with the family, chill and I will do a bit in the gym, not too much, and when we meet up we have got plenty of time until the World Cup to get into top shape.“We go through a lot in the season, with your clubs and countries, so you have got to switch off, maybe for me stay away from everything, leave the phone indoors and just chill and spend time with loved ones.”The Football Association will also honour individual players’ fitness and recovery programmes with England departing for St Petersburg on 12 June. The staggered nature of the returns will mean Phil Jones, Jesse Lingard, Marcus Rashford and Ashley Young join up on 28 May. It remains to be seen whether Gary Cahill’s late burst of form at Chelsea will earn him a recall but the former vice-captain and Everton’s Michael Keane are far from certain of their inclusion given Southgate may select Jones, John Stones and Harry Maguire as centre-backs, with Kyle Walker and Eric Dier also capable of playing there.Alexander-Arnold trained with the senior England setup while at St George’s Park with the Under-21s this year and could be picked even with the news positive on Kieran Trippier’s knee injury. Liverpool’s Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain and Joe Gomez have been ruled out through injury but Southgate has made checks on their club-mate Adam Lallana, whose campaign has been severely interrupted by thigh problems.The 30-year-old came off the bench for the last 16 minutes against Brighton on Sunday, his first involvement in six weeks, and he made a solitary league start all season. If selected, he could waive his week off and go straight into training with the squad once Liverpool have returned from Kiev.There had been calls for Shelvey, capped four times, to return to the fold for the first time since September 2015 after some impressive displays as Newcastle secured a top-half finish in the Premier League. Southgate is understood to be less inclined to pick the midfielder with doubts over the 26‑year‑old’s temperament."

“You’ve been great for us but we’re not prepared to renew your contract for next season.” The words I think every player fears and dreads, so when I heard them from my (now former) manager Chris Hughton, I felt a whole range of emotions. I’m at the stage in my career that I knew what might be coming but at the same time you can never prepare for it. I’ve been released and just like every player who has experienced the scenario there is no way to ready yourself.Disappointment is immediate along with the relief of at least knowing the decision. Then you question yourself and you feel failure, worry, fear and anxiety that any person in any line of work would feel when losing their job. I appreciate how privileged I am to do a job I love and get well paid for, and I understand people who say flippantly it’s OK for the likes of me who have had a long career and all the benefits that come with that. But the sheer emotion of having to break the bad news to my wife and children who are happy in the area and at their school and having to come to terms with the fact my chances of playing at the very top level again are extremely slim makes everything daunting, painful and testing.As sportsmen and competitors we have been taught and conditioned to never give up, to keep fighting when things are against you and to have faith in our ability, so when all of those things come to a point when your services are no longer needed, when you’re no longer required, it is an extremely bitter pill to swallow no matter how much you try to prepare and know that day will come. I’ve enjoyed an incredible three years at Brighton, a period of stable improvement year on year. To have gone from the pain of missing out on automatic promotion by one goal, bouncing back and going up the next season and then beating Manchester United at home to ensure we retained our Premier League status has been nothing short of a fairytale.This journey has been led by Hughton, a manager full of humility, respect, empathy and confidence in himself because of his detailed planning and preparation for games. But behind that, supporting him, was a club with synergy where every single member of staff, the players and the supporters were fighting for the same goal. All of them had a shared vision and sense of accountability of where they wanted to go and, more importantly, what needed to be done to get there.It amazes me when we analyse football how little we take into account the human element of the game – we can all talk about systems, tactics and team selections but what actually makes the difference is the people operating on and off the pitch. Are they diligent, resilient, honest, caring and supportive as characters or do they point fingers at the first moment of hardship and worry more about themselves than the benefit of the group?At Brighton we never had that problem. That’s why it worked and I hope the philosophy of person first, player after is continued. There are so many people at the club I want to thank, who I have learned from and benefited from being in their presence. It makes it impossible to name them all but I’m confident they know how grateful I am for their help.I would, however, like to highlight the influence of two who are intrinsic to the wellbeing and success of the club’s players. The captain, Bruno, is the most dedicated, gifted, charismatic and caring footballer I have ever come across. At nearly 38 he is playing for, excelling and leading a Premier League club from a position at full-back where pace and stamina are two of the biggest attributes needed. He is an example that the so-called impossible can be achieved with hard work, confidence and passion, and he sums up everything good about the game we love.The second is one of the “invisible” people who is never mentioned on the pitch but is the oil in the machine and proof it is the work of the collective, not just the “stars” that helps achieve success. Steve Gibbon is the player liaison officer and is a man who fixes every problem possible for a club – his job is to take the pressure off players with anything and everything – and he puts his heart, soul and love of the club first to ensure the players are mentally ready to produce on the pitch. His job is 24 hours a day be it giving lifts to players, helping them find schools and houses or even paying parking fines for them, and his input is just as important as ours on the field of play to make us successful.So while I’m sad at leaving such a wonderful club and while I’m uncertain of my next step in the world of football, I feel blessed to have been part of the journey that has seen Brighton get promoted from the Championship to securing their status in the Premier League.I’m getting to the final stage of completing my Uefa pro licence in coaching and managing may be the next step, though at the moment I’m still open to playing. I will make sure I take heed of the lessons I have learned from my time at Brighton and apply them in the future as a player, coach or manager."

Burnley are looking for their first win in five matches, against Bournemouth, but no one really cares about that at Turf Moor. Three points to see out a memorable season would be nice, but Burnley already have a hugely impressive 54 and have put themselves into Europe for the first time since 1967. No one was expecting that, though as a result Burnley will be expecting interest in Sean Dyche to resurface again over summer. “It’s the price of success,” chairman Mike Garlick said.

Until he was 12, Johan Cruyff lived on the corner of Tuinbouwstraat and Akkerstraat in the working-class Betondorp district of Amsterdam. As well as being a wonderfully creative footballer, who during the mid-1970s became the best in the world, Cruyff was also famously leftwing. He said he could never have played for Real Madrid, because it was the club of General Franco, and became a strong supporter of Catalan independence during his years with Barcelona.Cruyff died two years ago, at the age of 68, but in Betondorp the legacy of his progressive politics lives on. His childhood home at 32 Akkerstraat has recently become available to rent, but there is a strict condition: only those with a household income of less than £36,000 should apply. With its historical associations, the two-bedroom flat would be worth a great deal on the open market, but that is not the way Cruyff would have wanted to play it. Owned by a social housing association, number 32 could be yours for £530 a month.It was on the pavement outside number 32, close to Ajax’s old De Meer stadium, where Cruyff first kicked a ball in earnest. He regularly returned to the area and his institute built a sports facilities nearby, known as the Cruyff courts. But attempts in the past to turn the apartment into a museum dedicated to him and his career, both as a footballer and manager, are believed to have been rejected by the man himself. The housing association says Cruyff’s childhood home features a “nice ground floor with a large garden” and spacious living room suitable for two to three people.The new residents will have to be big Cruyff fans though. Two of the apartment’s four large windows looking on to the street are covered with a dedication to the footballer, including a typically forthright quotation: “When I was young, to play outside was really normal. We wouldn’t think about it. Today kids are playing more with their mobile phones or sitting behind their computers. Because of this, more kids are suffering from obesity and the solution should be very simple. We have to teach children how to move more at school. With just a few alterations we could create for Dutch schoolyards more opportunities for children to play outside together. This can only happen if we do it together.”The flat’s windows are particularly large as the property once doubled up as the family greengrocery business until Cruyff’s father, Hermanus Cornelis Cruyff, died in 1958 of a heart attack, aged 45. Cruyff – a three-time winner of the Ballon d’Or, given to Europe’s best player – later said that his life up to 45 was beset by anxiety that he too would die young. His mother later moved a few blocks away and became a cleaner at Ajax, where her son was already becoming a star player in the youth teams.Students have lived rent-free in the property for the last five years, on condition that they helped in the community.Martin Schill, 71, who has lived opposite the flat for 15 years, said: “The students moved out last week. Before that it was a couple in their mid-60s who had lived there for 30 years. But they got a bit fed up with the constant interest, international interest too at times, so they moved.“A tour guide comes by here, and there is a Johan Cruyff run every year on his birthday from the Olympic stadium to Ajax’s stadium, which passes by the house.”Cruyff, who smoked heavily as a player – even lighting up at half-time – died in March 2016 from lung cancer. He only quit the habit in 1991 after undergoing heart surgery. On the footballer’s death, the Dutch king Willem-Alexander said the Netherlands had lost an icon.Schill said: “There were a thousand people at least out here when he died and it was covered with flowers. I am proud of living here. I like the attention that he gets. Cruyff deserves it and I do think it should be a museum. Apparently that has been raised again, but Cruyff’s wife doesn’t like all the fuss and attention, so it is being rented out.”A sports historian, Jurryt van de Vooren, said it was typical of the man that there was now debate about how to commemorate him. “People debated his football, his management and now his legacy. There has always been something going on with Cruyff,” he said.Ajax’s stadium, Amsterdam Arena, will officially be renamed the Johan Cruyff Arena next season. A square near the Olympic stadium will also no longer be called Stadionplein, but JohanCruijffplein instead.“The renaming of the stadium wasn’t really controversial but it means that it can’t have a commercial sponsor. Some wanted to be able to sell the name,” Van de Vooren said. “The renaming of Stadionplein has upset people because no one was asked about it. People are discovering the name of the area that they live in has suddenly changed.”A petition attracting thousands of signatures has endorsed the need for a tribute to Cruyff, but is demanding that Stadionplein retains its name. “Anything to do with Cruyff is complicated,” said Van de Vooren."

The Royal Wedding won’t be the only ostentatious display of privilege and wealth to be viewed with interest by the great unwashed on Saturday. The tens of thousands of flag-waving, cheering proles that line the streets to Windsor Castle in the hope of stealing a peek at the horse-drawn carriage procession transporting Harry and Meghan to their nuptials, will be matched later in the day by similarly curious hordes eager to rubberneck the FA Cup final between Manchester United and Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley.Quite which event turns out to be the most longwinded and tedious remains to be seen, although having clocked how José Mourinho has set out his stall for most of Manchester United’s other big games this season, The Fiver has a fair idea. But for all that, the fact that he and his opposite number, Antonio Conte, don’t like each other very much ought to lend the occasion considerably more spice and needle than will be on show at Windsor Castle.With United and Chelsea both going into the showdown on the back of disappointing seasons, there is an overwhelming sense that victory will be little more than a consolation prize; worth winning but nowhere near as prestigious as the kind of gaudy pots entitled fans of both footballing superpowers have come to expect. Asked if he thought there was any chance the match might be entertaining, Mourinho adopted the face of somebody who’s just stepped in something soft and very unpleasant left on the pavement by a dog.“I still don’t understand these words entertainment,” he droned. “You think 6-0 is entertaining? I don’t think so. I think entertaining is emotion until the end; is open result until the end; is everybody on their seats until the end … both dugouts nervous and tense with the unpredictability of the result. That for me as a football lover, that’s entertaining so I think it’s going to be entertaining.”Fears that the final might not be all that appeared to be confirmed when Conte added his two cents. “When you play a final the most important things is to win,” he said. “It will be a tactical game.” Windsor or Wembley? Wembley or Windsor? Two big matches scheduled for Saturday, but which will be more attritional for viewers?“There was a pressure here, powerful, never going away. I was fine when I went into the dressing room for the France game but I started to feel this powerful dizziness, overwhelmed, panicked, and they lay me on the physio’s bench. That was the first time but I had nasty episodes like that again. There’s medicine, psychological treatment to overcome the barriers you’ve erected, the fear.

West Ham are weighing up whether to pursue their interest in Barcelona’s Marlon Santos amid reservations about the defender’s capacity to succeed in English football.Manuel Pellegrini wants to strengthen his new side’s leaky defence and West Ham have made contact with Barça about Santos, who impressed on loan at Nice last season. Yet while reports in Spain have suggested the centre-back is on the verge of moving to the London Stadium for £17.5m (€20m), it is understood that West Ham are worried about the 22-year-old Brazilian’s physique.The east London club are pondering whether it would be a gamble to sign Santos, who is 5ft 11in, and senior officials have denied lodging a bid. They have not ruled out a move for the former Fluminese defender but have other targets, including Genoa’s Armando Izzo and Fulham’s Ryan Fredericks, who is yet to commit to a new deal.West Ham finished last season with the joint-worst defensive record in the Premier League, conceding 68 goals, and have released James Collins. Reece Oxford is interested in a move to Borussia Mönchengladbach and Sam Byram could be allowed to leave.Pellegrini is also targeting attacking reinforcements after replacing David Moyes as manager and West Ham are interested in another loan deal for Internazionale’s João Mário. The Portuguese midfielder spent the second half of last season at West Ham and caught the eye, scoring twice in 14 appearances. However, Inter rate him at £26m and could press for a permanent deal.West Ham, who are close to appointing Málaga’s Mario Husillos as their head of recruitment, will resist any attempt by Manchester United to sign Marko Arnautovic. However, they would be willing to listen to the right offer for Michail Antonio, who has attracted interest from Crystal Palace.A number of English clubs have been alerted to the availability of the promising Germany Under 19 international, Aaron Opoku, who has opted against signing professional terms at Hamburg. The 19-year-old has been with the German club since 2011 and impressed in their Under 19s and reserve teams last term. The likes of West Ham, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Everton have been monitoring his progress closely with Opoku keen to continue his development in the Premier League. Any suitors outside Germany would have to pay training compensation to Hamburg – at a price far lower than a normal transfer fee – if they secured the attacking midfielder on a senior contract. Dominic FifieldWolves are take up their option to buy Benik Afobe from Bournemouth for £12.5m. They have until Thursday to complete the transfer under the terms of the loan which brought Afobe to Molineux on 1 February. The striker, who scored six goals in 16 games to help secure promotion to the Premier League, spent a successful year at Wolves before signing for Bournemouth in 2016. David Hytner"

football,"Germany conjured football of a savagery unwitnessed against significant opposition in the tournament’s history
Simon Burnton

When it comes to the World Cup, hosting is supposed to help. Just ask Uruguay (1930), Italy (1934), England (1966), West Germany (1974), Argentina (1978) and France (1998), or Sweden (1958), Chile (1962) and South Korea (2002), who unexpectedly finished second, third and fourth, respectively. Rival teams should be cowed by the passion and the number of home fans, the hosts buoyed.Not this time. “You looked at the faces of the Brazilian players when they walked on the pitch during the World Cup and it looked like they were about to compete in the Hunger Games,” said Zico, great Brazilian midfielder of the 1970s and 80s. “They weren’t enjoying the moment and that made things harder for them. The moment they met a team of the same pedigree they were caught out.”Brazil and Spain are the only World Cup winners not to have won at home, which is particularly surprising as the former have won pretty much everywhere else, and have hosted twice. On the first attempt in 1950 they unexpectedly lost to Uruguay in the final at the Maracanã, a scar on the nation’s footballing psyche that came to be known as the Maracanazo. In 2014 they created another miserable legend, the Mineirazo. This, though, was more than just an upset, different to mere disappointment. This was humiliation.For seven first-half minutes, Germany conjured football of a savagery unwitnessed against significant opposition in the tournament’s history. This was football as blood sport. Between the eighth second of the 23rd minute and the 49th second of the 29th minute Germany, one goal to the good already, scored four more, piercing Brazil’s defence with such frequency and brutality and engendering such horror among onlookers that footage really should be viewed through an opaque shower curtain and accompanied by a screeching Bernard Herrmann score. It was a nation’s dreams being sluiced down the plughole in a stream of saltwater. “I just wanted to give some happiness to my people. To my people, who suffer so much already,”David Luiz said after the game. “I just wanted to see my people smiling.”In the 23rd minute, when Miroslav Klose became the first man to score 16 World Cup goals and put Germany two up, television cameras picked out a female Brazil fan, face painted green and gold, a single tear rolling down her cheek. A minute later Toni Kroos sent a first-time, left-footed shot screaming into the net from the edge of the area, and cameras focused on another female fan, looking at her companion in utter bemusement. It was already too much for one couple of São Paulo. “I was watching at home with my wife and, after the third goal went in, she started to cry,” said Tite, current Brazil coach. “That started me off. The 7-1 is like a ghost. It’s present. People still talk about it, but the more you talk about it, the less likely it is that the ‘ghost’ disappears.”It wasn’t over. From the resulting kick-off Kroos stole the ball from Fernandinho, played a one-two with Sami Khedira and sidefooted in a third. Three minutes later, when Khedira scored the fifth, directors left the fans alone.Meanwhile, on Germany’s bench, coach Joachim Löw had a question for his assistant, Hansi Flick. “Hansi, tell me,” he asked, “is this actually happening?” Löw describes his feelings at this point as “a mix of absolute joy and disbelief. It was 5-0, in a semi-final against the hosts. It was unbelievable”.A little over 15 minutes later Löw gave a half-time team-talk surely unlike any other, one in which he felt compelled to ask his players not to be too good. “I didn’t want anyone to make a fool of the Brazilians in front of an audience of millions,” he said. “The respect the Brazilians showed to us, across the country, was enormous. And for me, it was completely unthinkable that we should humiliate them, or to show arrogance towards them.”Eight years earlier Löw had been assistant manager to Jürgen Klinsmann when the Germans were beaten on home soil in a World Cup semi, by Italy in Dortmund. “In 2006 we experienced for ourselves how painful it can be to miss out on a World Cup final in front of your own fans,” said Löw. In 2014 they mixed cruelty with sympathy.There were two more German goals in the second half, both scored by the substitute Andre Schürrle, though there could have been more: Oscar’s last-minute consolation for Brazil came seconds after Mesut Özil had been one on one with Júlio César, only to miss the chance.It was Brazil’s first World Cup semi-final defeat for 76 years, and their first defeat at home in any competitive match for 39 years. It was their most emphatic defeat of any kind for nearly a century, since Uruguay beat them 6-0 in 1920. In the history of the World Cup, the only other teams to have found themselves five goals down at half-time are Zaire (to Yugoslavia in 1974) and Haiti (to Poland in the same year); this is not the kind of company Brazil are used to keeping.Two members of the team – Luiz Gustavo and Dante – had to go back to Germany to continue club careers. “If I had been in another country, it would have been easier,” Dante said a few months later. “People quickly forget about respect. They forget everything you’ve done. You are alone. You’re playing against people who, as soon as they can, try to hurt you by reminding you of this event. It was painful and hard, but I learned a lot from it. For me, in football, what’s done is done. Today I’m happy. In life, you need to move forwards.”Neymar, Brazil’s forward and talisman, had been injured in the quarter-final against Colombia and watched the semi-final at home. Midway through the second half, with his mother Dona Nadine weeping, Neymar switched off his television. The dream of leading his team to victory – or, given his injury, simply cheering them on from the sidelines – was over.But not for long. Two years later Rio hosted the Olympics, and a younger Brazilian team with Neymar again its figurehead had a chance to make amends. They drew their first two games, against South Africa and Iraq without scoring, towhistles and jeers of a disappointed home support. Then they clicked: Denmark, Colombia and Honduras were beaten by an aggregate of 12-0 and they swept into a final against … Germany.It went, in the end, to penalties; all five Brazilians scored, Neymar the last to do so, and Nils Petersen’s effort was saved. It was a moment of catharsis and, as the players celebrated in a sold-out Maracanã, the fans struck up a particular song, one also heard when Brazil returned to the Estadio Mineirão for a World Cup qualifier three months later, for the first time since the heartache of the semi-final, and thrashed Argentina 3-0: O Campeao Voltou. The champions are back."
football,"In an extract from Grant Wahl’s new book, the Germany and Bayern Munich captain reveals his goalkeeping philosophy and explains his sweeper-keeper role

Sun 20 May 2018 18.57 BST


First published on Sun 20 May 2018 18.00 BST

Modern football has a lot in common with the German autobahn. The speed of the game has no limits these days and the players are like finely calibrated sports cars: faster, sleeker and more powerful than ever. Movement is constant, and yet there remains an order to things, a reminder that even on the edge, there are forces that prevent chaos. No player better illustrates this than Manuel Neuer, the world’s best goalkeeper, who has redefined his position. “I’m a little bit risky, but I’m standing for security and protection, and you have to give your team-mates that feeling as well,” says Neuer, captain of Bayern Munich and Germany. “In life, I’m a guy who likes to drive a car quite fast, but I wear a seat belt at the same time.”Surrounded by Champions League trophies in the Bayern Munich boardroom, the 6ft 4in, 210lb Neuer gives off an aura of physical power, a combination of size, strength and the potential of movement at high speed. Neuer speaks better English than he lets on at first, and he draws a special pleasure from discussing his ultimate fast-lane experience, even if that means taking heart-stopping risks as the last line of defence. “It’s up to me to help my defenders and it’s better for me to get the ball before the striker than to [wait and] have a one-on-one situation in the box,” he says. “That’s more dangerous than to go out, because the striker has the chance to score a goal. If he can’t get the ball, he won’t get any opportunity.”The downside of Neuer’s approach is the football version of hara-kiri. If he misjudges the speed and trajectory of the ball or the striker and arrives too late, he may concede a goal and look silly in the process. “I don’t feel the fear in my head in this moment,” he says. “I am always thinking positive. It’s all about the first step. If I think I will get the ball, I go out. I can’t stop halfway because the goal is empty and the player would have the opportunity to shoot. You make the reaction, and then, of course, you have to be sure to get the ball. But it’s years of practice. You can’t say from one day to the other: ‘Now I will do it,’ you know? You have to feel it.”When Neuer speaks about his goalkeeping influences as a youngster, one revealing aspect is his division between German and non-German keepers and his association of the word “modern” with those who hail from outside Germany. “In Germany, Jens Lehmann was a model style for a German goalkeeper,” Neuer says of the player who spent 10 seasons at Schalke, the club that developed Neuer. “In the international style, my idol was [the Netherlands’] Edwin van der Sar. He was so modern, much more modern than Lehmann. He had another level. He could play with his left and right foot and go out of the box and go out to get crosses. He was present as a personality. Then there was Oliver Kahn: his reflexes, his ambition. He trained hard, and in that sense he was my idol. So I have some different pieces put together. It’s like having a lot of coaches, and you save something from the coach that you think is good for you – and that becomes you.”Of all the goalkeeper coaches Neuer has had over the years, the one he reveres the most is Toni Tapalovic, who was hired by Bayern Munich at Neuer’s request when he joined the club in 2011. Like Neuer, Tapalovic was born in Gelsenkirchen and played in goal for Schalke. The two men are only five years apart in age, and they developed a connection during Neuer’s formative years with the club. “When he was the No 2 goalkeeper [at Schalke], I was very young,” Neuer says. “He knew that I was a little bit better than him, but he always told me that I had to do more. He stayed outside and worked with me when the team was going into the dressing room. And he was my colleague, so we had friendship and cooperation on the pitch. After that, he had a lot of injuries – two shoulders, a knee, hip – and he stopped his [playing] career and started at Schalke to help coach the goalkeepers. I recommended him to Bayern. I think he has brought me to my best level.”A goalkeeper from the age of four, he discovered early on that he had a leading foot and a standing leg, and for him it felt more comfortable to jump to his left than to his right in order to make a save. Dives to his right, he says, would often result in awkward landings that gave him bruises on his right hip.Working with a coach, Neuer had to train himself to explode to his right more easily, just as a right-footed player would work on passing and shooting with his left. Even today, Neuer acknowledges that diving and extending his body to his right to stop a shot won’t look the same as when he does the same thing to his left. “It’s the same power, but it looks different because the body changes when you are up in the air,” he says. “When you are lying down on the grass and need to stand up, you stand up in a different way on each side. It’s not symmetrical. The important thing is that you can jump high and long and stand up quickly. It doesn’t have to look perfect, but it has to be quick.”Yet shot stopping, which was once the hallmark of a proficient goalkeeper, is now a bare-minimum requirement. The 21st-century keeper also needs to organise the back line and set-piece defence, command the box on crosses, disrupt opposing attacks outside the box and initiate his team’s attack.Comfort on the ball with both feet is mandatory, as is the ability to play passes to moving targets over short and long distances, with your feet and with an overhand throw. What’s more, the strategic trend of extreme defensive pressing all over the field means goalkeepers often need to make themselves available as pressure-release valves for defenders needing to get rid of the ball.“To be a modern goalkeeper, I have to think offensively, to initiate our attacking moves safely and securely,” Neuer says. “Both my teams, Bayern and Germany, usually have more than 60% possession. So I have to be outside the box and be involved in the passing game from the back to get the ball to the first, second and third row of players. All these things are incorporated in my game, but I can afford it because I’m in these strong teams.”If you watch Bayern Munich regularly, it becomes clear that Neuer almost never boots the ball aimlessly downfield, like so many other goalkeepers do. Under Pep Guardiola, the word you heard most often from the Bayern players describing their attacking philosophy was “control”. Why would you boom the ball downfield and risk giving up control? “The passing game has become more important,” Neuer says. “We rarely just hammer the ball forward. I probably have twice as many touches of the ball now than I used to have at Schalke.”Bayern Munich’s and Germany’s stranglehold on possession often means Neuer has fewer occasions to demonstrate some of the more traditional goalkeeping skills. But he still has to call upon them at times, knowing that one mistake can turn a game. How does he know when to come out for a cross? The thought process on whether to commit is not much different from deciding whether to leave his box to cut off a through-ball – though there tends to be more human traffic in his path on crosses, requiring him to read even more variables in a split second. “You have to know which players are in your area and whether you have a free way to get to the ball,” he explains. “If I know I can’t get the ball, then I have to stay in.”Television commentators sometimes say goalkeepers should always come out for any cross in their six-yard box. But Neuer argues that is not necessarily the case. “It depends how high the ball is coming into the box,” Neuer says. “If it’s a high ball they can’t reach, you know you can go out. But if it’s a very low ball and a striker is there, it’s very dangerous and you can’t go out.” Even today, there are enough variables that the same keeper who will venture 40 yards from his goal to pick off a through-ball will sometimes refuse to move even six yards, depending on the situation.More commonly, though, Bayern’s and Germany’s obsession with control means the ball is at the other end of the field. Neuer says one of the hardest parts of his job is when he hasn’t faced a shot from the opposition in 45 minutes, and then he’s suddenly called into action. “Sometimes in the winter it’s very cold, you know, especially in Bavaria,” he says, half-smiling but fully serious. “It’s not easy in this moment, because you have to go from 0 to 100.”Such is life on the German autobahn.This is an edited extract from Football 2.0: How the World’s Best Play the Modern Game by Grant Wahl.

Email from Nathan Chehoud:“Just watched the interview, and was impressed with Emery’s balance of passion and pragmatism. Didn’t promise the world overnight, but did promise effort and commitment. And what a great expression – “protagonist”. I’m looking forward to my club being the protagonist in their own story. To being on the front foot, with a clear strategy - from the corporate side all the way through to each player and their individual roles in individual games. Much as I loved the Wenger Era, the last few years didn’t feel like Arsenal were writing their own story – more having it written for them by external factors and internal inertia. This Gunner is excited – and sleepy. It’s midnight in Australia.”

Today has definitely made me more excited for Emery. It’s like there’s an entirely new Arsenal to debate and discuss.True, too. Gazidis underlined that: this is a new page, a club whose inner workings now look unrecognisable to those of a decade, or even five years, ago.

2.53pm BST
14:53

Emery seems like a very ambitious guy, but he also comes across as humble and down to earth, not some egomaniac, which is a big reliefA good take – I doubt that, emotionally, the highs will be too high or the lows too low with Emery.

2.51pm BST
14:51

My take: there wasn’t a huge amount to get worked up about one way or the other, partly because Emery is fairly savvy, partly because he doesn’t speak fluent English and partly because he’s-only-just-arrived-so-give-the-poor-guy-a-chance. But he’s clearly up for the challenge, wants to play energetic and assertive football, and feels he is the right fit for the club. It was a decent enough first outing in front of the media but I suspect that, for the time being, his actions will speak louder than his words.

2.47pm BST
14:47

In the meantime don’t be shy – drop me a line with your responses to all that. Did you like what you heard from Emery?

2.45pm BST
14:45

Incidentally, I felt the most interesting part of that was Gazidis’s outline of the process’s timescale, in that long bit right at the start. Clearly keen to put any idea that Emery wasn’t No 1 choice until very late on to bed ...

2.43pm BST
14:43

That’s it from Emery, and indeed from Gazidis. Top lines to follow ...

2.42pm BST
14:42

Are you relishing beating Guardiola or Mourinho at last? Have you spoken to any other Premier League managers?“In terms of my past experience, it makes me feel stronger and also allows me to have a guide to my future trajectory. Im very excited to be here, against top coaches and top teams, and have to say the Premier League now it right at the top.“I speak with a lot of coaches, those are private conversations, but now that I’m here all information is welcome.”

2.41pm BST
14:41

Mesut Ozil – what do you think of him?“He’s one of the biggest talents at Arsenal and I want talented players here, I want to spend time with him, and all the players. I want to speak with them about how inspired and excited I am to be here and I want the players to feel that as well. This is a wonderful project and we all need to give 100%.”Updated

2.40pm BST

How will you win the Champions League?“All titles are important for us. We can, and want to be, candidates for them. I don’t promise today we will win, but I can promise you we will work hard, will work together, will work with emotion, demanding to find all the objectives.”

2.39pm BST
14:39

What most attracted you to this project? Any other offers? What would be success for you next season?“I had three fantastic meetings in terms of who was at those meetings. First I met with Ivan, Raul and Sven, they analysed me as a person and a coach, and thought I could be an option for this team. I have to say after a three-hour meeting there was fantastic chemistry between us. That came simply from the fact it was Arsenal, a wonderful history, and I hoped there could be a new future for the club. The second meeting was with the owners, the heart of the club, they transmitted what the fans wanted and I felt a positive energy. My third meeting was in Atlanta and again I had a fantastic feeling. Everything has been very positive in terms of the challenge, which makes me very proud and is a great opportunity to grow.“Success would be developing, and that’s about battling for every title. It’s in Arsenal’s history and it’s in my history as well. We want to be among the best teams in Europe. I want the team to make the fans proud of the side. I know they are already but I want to make them even more so.”

2.35pm BST
14:35

Back to Emery – how you describe your style of football?“In my career I am very demanding for all, demanding of the players also. My idea is to be a protagonist for all of the match. We play against teams with this personality, and I think the history here shows they love playing with possession of the ball. I like this, and when you don’t have possession of the ball I want a squad very, very intense in pressing. It’s two things that are very important for me. Being a protagonist, possession of the ball, and pressing.”

2.32pm BST
14:32

To Gazidis – how big is the rebuilding job?“Our players, we believe, will respond to the new energy Unai brings. They will have somebody under whom they can improve their individual and collective games. If they embrace these challenges the players we have today can be more successful. I don’t think anybody thinks sixth place is a position for a club of our stature How big a rebuilding job is a conversation we have begin and we want to be a candidate for the biggest trophies, as Unai said. But it can’t be done in one leap. I strongly think our fans, when they see the energy Unai brings to the club, will embrace it. The challenge is great, we’ve spent a lot of time building to this moment, not just the last month or six weeks. Building up the capabilities of the club, facilities, medical, analytics, scouting, recruitment. We are working in a different way to the past, more of a team effort, supporting Unai’s vision and energy and finding ways to be successful.”Was it too individual in the past?“I don’t say that, I’m not looking backwards, we’re doing it in a new way but you’re never going to hear me being critical of what’s gone before. Now is the time for us to turn a new page and look forward with confidence. There’s a special feeling here and we need to recapture this and push this club forward.”Updated

2.28pm BST
14:28

What are your targets? Do you need to spend a lot?“I believe in the players we have here. We can grow with these players and the objective is to work hard with these talented players, to work to be a candidate for all the titles in the future. Then it’s very important for the club, after two years outside the Champions League, to work towards this, to arrive and be the best team in the Premier League and also the world.”

How passionately did you fight for this job?“In all the meetings with the people – Ivan, Raul, Sven – the connection was very important. We spoke about all they want and I want to work together, on this club, this responsibility. To know my ambition, my passion. It is a big responsibility but I think this feeling is very important and my experiences with big clubs are important. All the conversations are very good.”

2.22pm BST
14:22

Is Jack Wilshere in your plans?“I don’t want to speak about any of the players today. We think we need to change little things. Today I want to work, want to speak globally for the squad.”

2.21pm BST
14:21

How big a challenge is this?“In my career every year I grow up with a new challenge. For me the challenge is a dream come true.”What are your immediate priorities?“Now? To know you. And all the conversations with Ivan and people who work here, to give me all the information about the club. I know all the players, I think they are very important and I want to speak individually with them face to face.”Updated

Now Emery is speaking, thanking people and speaking highly of the conversation he had with the board. “Also thank you Ivan, Raul and Sven. The first meeting with Arsenal personnel was with people who, after three hours, I had a very good feeling that we will work together and create a new present and future for Arsenal.”He also thanks Arsène Wenger for his legacy. “For all coaches in the world you are a reference. I learned with him all the things in football.”“My English is not the very best now and I want to make an effort to speak with you to explain my ambition. I am very excited for this opportunity at a big club, a great city and stadium.”

Ivan Gazidis: “I’m really delighted and excited to announce the new head coach. I know that came as a bit of a surprise, perhaops there were one or two rewrites necessary. But those who know won’t speak and those who speak won’t know. I’ll give you a little insight into the process. We formed a three-person committee of me, Sven Mislintat and Raul Sanllehi. We had some clear criteria: aggressive, entertaining football; personality that fitted with Arsenal’s values; also a record of developing players through detailed tactical instruction and also cultural demand, pushing players.“We looked through and analysed on the basis that every coach in the world would be interested in this position. We don’t believe any position in world football is more attractive. We created an eight-person longlist. All of them were interested and took part in extensive, in-person interviews. None of them at any stage withdrew their interest. So we were in a fortunate position to make our first choice, and that’s what we did. Our first interviewee was conducted on 25th April, our last was conducted on 15th May and we interviewed Unai on 10th May. We made our unanimous recommendation to the board on 18th May, accompanied by a 100-page dossier. We then met with London members of our board on Monday this week. Unai and Raul and I flew to Atlanta and met Josh and Stan Kroenke and flew back on the red-eye last night.“So why Unai Emery? I’ve followed Unai’s career very closely and he’s always ben on my radar screen. He’s got a fantastic record wherever he’s gone and his team’s improve over time. He’s a superb fit with the criteria I laid out. But it’s important to move this beyond the paper exercise and having taken third-person references it was very important to move to personal meetings. Unai was incredibly impressive, he came in extraordinarily well prepared, he had an analysis of all of our individual players, their qualities and how he believes he can help them develop individually and collectively, and also detailed analysis of our off-field team. But this wasn’t a purely technical exercise. What also distinguished Unai was the chemistry between us and feeling for football in the room. His detail, hard work, love for football and will to win made us think this fit was exactly right.”Updated

“I’m pleased we’ve got someone credible enough to take us to the next step,” Ian Wright has said. I mean, that’s the thing: Emery has serially won European trophies with a club that, like Arsenal, hasn’t seriously been troubling the biggest title contenders. The fit isn’t too bad.

An extract from Stan Kroenke’s welcome message:“Several things stood out during his interview and the entire process; his football knowledge, energy, determination and love of the game. His familiarity with our club and our players, the Premier League and the game in Europe were all very impressive. He shares our vision to move forward, to build on the platform created by Arsène Wenger and help this club enjoy greater success.”He may or may not have been first choice but those who’ve seen Emery work closely reckon he’s a top operator.

1.47pm BST
13:47

Arsenal fans, does all this excite you? I’m getting “meh” vibes from a lot of people but I don’t think it is a huge slight on Emery that he only achieved mixed success at PSG. Anyone who goes there is on a hiding to nothing and this season he had to work around the absurd Neymar circus too, which I’d not wish on anyone. Won’t he add to Arsenal the level of attention to detail, particularly when looking at opponents’ strengths and weaknesses, that his predecessor wasn’t so hot on?

1.43pm BST
13:43

“His career speaks for itself. He did it perfectly in Spain with many teams, as well in France. Welcome to England, a good manager is coming.”Not my words: those of Pep Guardiola when pressed on the arrival of his countryman.

Arsenal have a new manager! Yes they do, and what a strange sentence that is to write. Here’s the even more exciting part: he’s about to speak to us, we think at about 2pm UK time, so let’s huddle round the monitor to see exactly what Unai Emery has to say.Should we expect a bold mission statement? A few swift platitudes? A duet with Arsène Wenger? A withering takedown of Neymar followed by a detailed outline for his plans to eke world domination out of Alex Iwobi? We will soon find out. And in the meantime, let me know your reactions to this appointment – which of course was only confirmed this morning. It’s all moved very quickly indeed.Updated

Liverpool will step up their pursuit of Nabil Fekir after the Champions League final as they look to secure the €70m-rated (£61m) Lyon captain before the World Cup.Fekir, who has played as an attacking midfielder and forward for his hometown club, is a major summer target for Jürgen Klopp with the Liverpool manager yet to replace Philippe Coutinho.Liverpool’s finances will also be swelled by around £70m for reaching Saturday’sChampions League final against Real Madrid.Klopp has already signed Naby Keita from Red Bull Leipzig for this summer, with the Guinea midfielder costing £52.75m, but is keen to strengthen his midfield options in order to challenge Manchester City for next season’s Premier League title.The 24-year-old Fekir has enjoyed another excellent season in France and earned a call-up to Didier Deschamps’ World Cup squad. The France international is aware of Liverpool’s interest and, when asked about a possible transfer to Anfield by RTL replied: “Why not?”"
football,"Smaller teams dream of taking on an MLS club in the US Open Cup. But that dream can come at a steep cost
Jeff Rueter

Thu 24 May 2018 10.00 BST

For the US Open Cup, 2017 was the year of the underdog. The hype started early when Christos FC – an amateur club out of Maryland named after a local liquor store – upset two fourth-division sides and a USL team before going out to MLS’s DC United. Upsets continued to prevail, as the USL’s FC Cincinnati beat the Columbus Crew and Bastian Schweinsteiger’s Chicago Fire en route to a quarter-final showdown with then-NASL side Miami FC. Cincinnati won, serving as the tournament’s first non-MLS semi-finalist since 2011.“For these lower-division clubs, the Open Cup is a one-off opportunity to prove themselves,” according to Peter Wilt, who launched Chicago Fire, NWSL’s Chicago Red Stars, and NASL/USL’s Indy Eleven. “That dream of beating the bigger clubs is very fleeting. It’s the one opportunity that you have whenever you qualify, and it’s usually gone after two or three matches.”But that dream can cripple smaller clubs. While the US Open Cup is often compared to England’s famous FA Cup, America’s vast spaces make it a much different proposition. A non-league English club’s away trip may involve a coach trip of a few hours. Teams in the US Open Cup, however, may have to pay for flights across a continent.Meet Minneapolis City SC, known colloquially as the Crows. The team operates on a very small budget (the club spent $46,000 in 2017) and relies entirely on sponsorships and memberships all over the globe at $50 a share. Most of its players are college kids back home for the summer, able to retain amateur status in the offseason. During qualification for the 2018 tournament they played under their club operations name of Stegman’s Soccer Club. In qualification, the team was drawn to Kansas’ Santa Fe Wanderers, a $6,000 trip for Minneapolis. When Santa Fe forfeited, the draw pitted Minneapolis against Aurora Borealis Soccer Club in Illinois, another $4,000 trip via coach buses and hotel to Chicago. When the team won that round, they were in for an even longer trip.“It was a surprise when we were drawn to Rochester, New York” Minneapolis City chairman Dan Hoedeman told the Guardian. “It required a multi-leg flight [it would take 16 hours to drive between from Minneapolis to Rochester non-stop] and they had an awful middle school stadium with limited availability. A lot of our players work 9-5 jobs on weekdays, and Rochester only offered to play on that Sunday afternoon. We were at the point where if our game in Rochester had made it to penalties, we would’ve had to leave to catch our flight.”Stegman’s ended up losing 2-1, conceding deep into the second half. It was a tough result to swallow, and was only made more difficult by the logistics.“If we hadn’t gotten $12,000 in donations, we would’ve had nothing,” club business director Sarah Schreier remarked. “The Rochester flights alone were $10,000 for 20 players. We could barely make it happen, and we both put club expenses on our personal credit cards. We still spent $3,000 on top of the donations.”It’s a regular plight for amateur teams in the States. For those looking to get a crack at the national spotlight – Hoedeman referenced Harpos FC and Christos FC’s magical runs – it requires funding beyond the usual operating budget. Minneapolis City nearly had to stop streaming its games this year to cut costs, but a recent sponsorship allowed those funds to resurface.“I think, to [United Soccer president] Carlos Cordeiro’s credit, he set up a platform that says he’ll invest some of the surplus into growing the Open Cup,” Wilt says. “It’s an area where the investment of US Soccer funding into prize money and promotional efforts can make the tournament more important to more clubs. In turn, it would provide more money to participating teams in terms of ticket sales and ultimately TV deals.”At the moment, the prize money is scant for the US Open Cup. The 2018 champion will win $300,000. The tournament runner-up will receive $100,000 and the team that advances the furthest from each lower division will earn $25,000 (up from $15,000 last year). While it may seem like a good bounty for an amateur side, travel costs completely wipe out the potential payout.“It would’ve cost us $10,000 a game across three games to qualify for the Open Cup,” Hoedeman clarified. “For Christos, that prize probably moved the needle because they didn’t have to travel like we did – they hosted DC United. For us, it was all about travel. People want to see the Open Cup, but $15,000 wouldn’t have even covered our last qualifier.”And so, the money has to come from somewhere. Minneapolis charges $8 per match ticket to non-members, and often gives tickets away for free to local YMCA chapters. Compared to the rising ticket prices across MLS and USL, it’s a pittance of a return. It may be time for US Soccer (operating with a nine-figure surplus at the moment) to look after its smallest teams.“When the specific cases come up that require financial help, it’s the responsibility of US Soccer to come up with a solution,” Wilt upheld. “Whether that’s level across the board with a pre-planned increase of funds or if it’s a fungible pool of money that committee votes on in unusual circumstances, these clubs should be taken care of. The tournament needs to be inclusive, not exclusive.”That inclusivity may be time sensitive. For now, amateur sides are beginning to write off the tournament as a dream too costly to come true, the most expensive adrenaline hit in US soccer. Minneapolis’ players have all expressed interest in giving it another go this fall. “The magic of the cup is a real thing if you’re a player trying to get noticed,” Hoedeman remarked. Still, time will tell if the magic is within reach.“I think the idea of the tournament is really respectable,” Schreier defended. “It gives a nod to players and clubs that are under wraps and are trying to make a go of it. It has the potential to be really awesome. If US Soccer can figure out how to execute what it’s trying to achieve, it could be really special.”"

Defeat hit hard and so did the coach, apportioning blame and pointing the finger; they had let everyone down, he said. It was 2001, Spain had been knocked out of the U17 World Cup, and during the flight home Fernando Torres and Andrés Iniesta, close friends since they had met at 14, decided to put their feelings into words. As they sat on the plane, they wrote a letter outlining everything that had gone wrong. They never posted it but the writing helped and when they touched down back at Barajas airport they swapped shirts, dedicating them to each other. On the shirt Fernando handed to Andrés, it read: “One day you and me will win the World Cup together.”Nine years later, they did. Eight years after that, they bade farewell together. Six hundred kilometres apart but on the same day – the kids, fathers now, who scored the two most important goals in Spain’s history, in Vienna in 2008 and Johannesburg in 2010, played their last games at their clubs. Their paths have not been the same, but their departures shared more than just a date and because there are two of them, friends, team-mates and popular idols, because they leave the country, the loss feels more significant still.Iniesta’s official send-off was on Friday. Samuel Eto’o and Xavi Hernández were among those there; Real Madrid were represented by Emilio Butragueño, video messages were played, Pep Guardiola and Sergio Ramos appearing; and Iniesta’s shirts sold with the number on its side, infinity instead of eight. On the same night, Torres had begun his goodbye from the statue of Neptune in central Madrid, thousands of fans before him, celebrating their Europa League success against Marseille; 55,000 had gathered there where Torres said he had stood himself 22 years before, back when he was 11.But while their departures had been announced some time ago, even though they’d had moments that felt like farewells already, Iniesta dancing his last waltz in the Copa del Rey final, Torres lifting the trophy in Lyon, and although they’d been commemorated three days earlier, this time really was the end.At the Camp Nou, where Xabi Prieto was also bowing out, a huge mosaic read: “Thanks for so much.” Iniesta collected the league trophy at the end of the match. It was the 32nd he has won with Barcelona, the 35th overall. In his farewell letter Torres had said: “Thanks for so much and sorry for [giving] so little.” He won the World Cup with Iniesta, two European Championships as well, but as Atlético celebrated the Europa League success, Torres insisted: “This is the best thing I’ve won, without doubt.” There was a reason for that: he has won only four major club competitions and just one with Atlético – that one.Torres lifted the trophy, captain Gabi inviting him to join him, just as Antoine Griezmann had invited him to. With a couple of minutes to go, Torres was still on the bench; that was when Griezmann ran across and told Atlético’s assistant manager, Germán Burgos, to send him on. In his penultimate game for the club, he won his first title. As he stood before fans the following night he insisted: “For all those kids who have dreams: nothing is impossible, and still less if you’re Atlético.” For years, though, winning anything seemed impossible, which is why they never blamed him for going. In fact, they encouraged him to; they loved him, so they set him free. His only other title was the Second Division, 16 years ago – and that too helps to explain his impact, why Sunday mattered so much. When Torres returned, Diego Simeone insisted he had signed the footballer not the icon, but that is what he is. Just in footballing terms, his departure is not so traumatic. Torres, though, is not just a footballer. He is The Kid from Fuenlabrada, the youth product and fan, who appeared when they were relegated to the second division, the embodiment of hope, their only hope. One little year in hell, Jesús Gil called it, only it turned out to be two but Torres led them back, became the youngest ever captain, and leaving took longer than anyone imagined. He turned down Real Madrid. He embraced and embodied Atlético’s identity, understanding and expressing it better than anyone, the pitch, tone and sentiment invariably perfect.He suffered but waited; when he walked, it wasn’t just with their blessing but their gratitude. He was too good for this team, they knew; they convinced themselves that it was as if he hurt more than they did and didn’t stop supporting him. Liverpool shirts appeared at the Calderón. When he returned with them, both sets of fans chanted his name. When he returned properly, they were delighted. At his presentation over 35,000 were at the Calderón. He was always acutely conscious that he hadn’t actually done very much, almost a little embarrassed at how well they treated him. “You made me the happiest person in the world,” he said on Sunday. “I remember that he asked what he had done to deserve that when he came back,” Gabi said this week. “Well, I ask what we have done to deserve having you as the greatest exponent of Atlético around the world.”A lot had changed since he had been away, since Simeone had arrived. When he scored his first goal Jean-Francois Hernández was among his team-mates; when he scored his 100th, Jean-Francois’s son Lucas was. He’d been away and come back and in the meantime Atlético started to win. He surpassed 100 goals, but from his return until Thursday they didn’t win again. Mostly, he embraced a secondary role, although the sense he could offer more ultimately hastened his departure. He lifted the trophy, delighted, but had only been on the pitch a couple of minutes.Torres talked about the Champions League final in Milan as the game of his life; they were playing Real Madrid, the club where, he once insisted, “they don’t feel their football”, and lost on penalties. But at least they had played in a Champions League final, and that was unthinkable before. Which didn’t hurt any less but shouldn’t be forgotten and he was a reminder, so important precisely because he had been there in the bad times as well as the good. As well? Instead.“Now that we win,” Iñako Díaz Guerra wrote, “we have to remember who we are. And that’s what Fernando’s there for. It’s not that he’s the veteran who came on to waste time and treated it like a gift; it’s not that he’s the star who won the World Cup and the Euros but never felt so fulfilled as when he won the Europa League as a bit-part with Atleti, his Atleti; it’s not a star saying goodbye, it’s our historic memory.”Raised on Germany Street, the country against whom he scored the winning goal at Euro 2008, first taken to the Calderón by his grandfather in January 1995 to see Atlético draw 1-1 with Compostela, Torres recalled going to school in Fuenlabrada, “almost always pissed off because we had lost”, feeling like a lone Atlético in a place dominated by them, wearing his tracksuit in defiance. On Sunday, he walked out for his last ever game, knowing Atlético were going to finish ahead of Real for only the second time this century.Atlético end the season having let in just 22 goals in 38 games. He left after they let in more than a quarter of that in one game. Things had changed, alright. “I never needed a trophy to feel like the most loved player in the world,” he said on Sunday. By then, at last, he had one, 17 years after his debut. Outside the Wanda Metropolitano, a giant shirt was there for fans to sign. Photographs were lined along the concourse outside, an open-air Torres museum. He walked on for the last time as captain, carrying Nora, Leo and Elsa with him, his shirt, like those of all his team-mates, embroidered with the slogan: from Kid to Legend. A huge mosaic delivered the same message. They chanted his name. They lifted from their seats when he raced into the area, only to shoot wide, and again when he put an effort into the side netting. Then it happened: they roared when Ángel Correa laid it on a plate for him to score. There was another when he got the second, racing through to finish. Running into the crowd, he disappeared under the bodies.On his last night at the Calderón, he had scored twice. On his last night as an atlético, here he was again: two goals, ahead of Real Madrid, a winner at last. But going now, just like Iniesta who was in tears in Barcelona. Even the DJ and his abysmal music couldn’t entirely ruin it. There was a guard of honour and a joint ceremony with Prieto at the start. At the end, after he departed with 10 minutes to go, almost ceremoniously handing over the captain’s armband to Leo Messi and sitting in tears on the bench, he was lifted by team-mates and thrown into the air. He took to the microphone to offer one last: “Visca Barca! Visca Catalunya! Visca Fuentealbilla!” “I’ll always tell the story of the day I was at Iniesta’s farewell,” Ernesto Valverde said.In Madrid, they’ll talk of the day the Kid left. Torres went down the tunnel, and returned, team-mates giving him a guard of honour. Opponents Eibar applauded him too. No one had left, the place packed, but there was silence as the video played, a freckled kid with a blond mop appearing on the screen. “I’d like to start with those in the ‘third tier’,” he said, looking up beyond the stand in front, to the heavens, “especially Luis Aragonés, who showed us what Atletico Madrid is, and to my granddad …” His voice broke, tears appeared in his eyes. Gripping tighter, he pressed on: “… who gave his grandson the greatest gift you can give, which is to an atlético …”With every line – his parents, his wife and children, staff, team-mates – Torres seemed to swallow harder and the pauses grew longer, filled with song from the stands. “Today is the last day. It’s been over 400 games and it’s very hard knowing that this is the end,” he said. Then he started crying. As he circled the pitch one last time, they sang Atletico’s theme, a capella. And then, like Iniesta, he was gone.• All that and it comes down to this … nothing, really. For the first time, La Liga went into the final day with everything sorted. There was nothing to play for, unless you count the battle to be best of the Basques – Eibar for the first time. No relegation, no European places, no Champions League, and definitely not the title, which had been wrapped up early enough that they even managed to present Barcelona with their trophy in the season they actually won it.• Speaking of the Basque country, this is the second worst season in Athletic’s history.• It wasn’t just Iniesta, Prieto and Torres saying goodbye – already quite a hit in a single day. Among others, there was also Joaquín Caparrós, Asier Garitano and, although no one said so, Gareth Bale, scoring on what is probably his last game in Spain – at the stadium at which he scored his first.Celta 4–2 Levante, Leganés 3–2 Betis, Las Palmas 1–2 Girona, Málaga 0–1 Getafe, Sevilla 1–0 Alavés, Villarreal 2–2 Real Madrid, Valencia 2–1 Deportivo, Athletic 0–1 Espanyol, Atlético 2–2 Eibar, Barcelona 1–0 Real Sociedad.Champions: BarcelonaOther Champions League places: Atlético, Madrid, ValenciaEuropa League: Villarreal, Betis, Sevilla.Relegated: Deportivo, Las Palmas, Málaga.Top scorer: Messi, 34.Top scoring Spaniard: Iago Aspas, 22.Zamora: Jan Oblak."

“I’ve recently discovered that, in Nigeria, Dundee United is slang for ‘idiot’ or ‘fool’, apparently the result of a disastrous tour in 1972,” mails Nicholas Reid. “Are there any similar examples of football club names becoming slang terms around the world?”It’s true: Dundee United is slang for idiot in Nigeria. This peculiar fact came to British attention in 2010, during a BBC documentary about the Nigerian capital Lagos. A local man, Chubby, told the filmmakers how life in Lagos is not for the foolish. “Anybody who came to Lagos and he didn’t learn sense, he cannot get sense ever,” said Chubby. “Because here if you are a fool, they will learn you how to get sense. If you are a ‘Dundee United’, when they start to pour shit on you, you will get sense.”As this article in the Scotsman explains, many believe this stems from a disastrous tour in 1972. There is also a suggestion that, when Nigeria were based at Dens Park during the Under-16 World Cup of 1989, some mischievous Dundee fans decided to enrich their vocabulary.That’s one of the better examples of a club team becoming slang around the world. Another comes from Korea, as explained by Oliver Trenchard. “There is a phrase in Korea called ‘Leeds Days’ (리즈시절) that refers to a person or thing’s heyday,” says Oliver. “It relates back to the turn of the century when Leeds and more specifically Alan Smith were enjoying considerable success in Europe, and the fact they dropped off after that heyday.”You’re probably all familiar with the appropriation of Bristol City. The Turkey national team has also unwittingly provided football with soupçon of erotica. “The national team has made its way into the Turkish language with the phrase ‘Milli olmak’, which refers to a player’s first international call-up,” says Önder Susam. “It is used for a man who’s had sex for the first time. It’s use as an innuendo can be seen here as Rıdvan Dilmen bursts into laughter upon hearing the question ‘When did you get your first call-up?’.”Peter Svensson reminds us that, in Denmark, a ‘rigtig Jesper Olsen’ (a real Jesper Olsen) refers to an egregious mistake in any walk of life. That stems from his notorious backpass at the 1986 World Cup, which led to the most exciting team in the competition being pumped 5-1 by Spain. Although poor Loris Karius had the worst night of his life on Saturday, it could be worse. His name may be mud, but at least it’s not slang. Do you have any other examples? If so, you know what to do.“Hull finished this season 18th in the Championship with a goal difference of 0, while the team directly below them, Birmingham, had a goal difference of -30,” mails Christopher Harding. “Is this the largest goal difference, um, difference between two teams finishing next to one another?”Most of you pointed out this season’s 39-goal gap between Manchester City (+79) and Manchester United (+40). But that’s small beer in the magical world of goal difference difference. “Recently Celtic won the Scottish Premiership in 2014 with a +77 goal difference,” says Sean De Loughry. “Second placed Motherwell had a +4 goal difference. That’s a difference of 73 goals.”“They can’t hold a light to the 1917-18 MTK side who, it would be fair to say, dominated the Hungarian top flight,” continues Sean. “They scored an impressive 147, conceding 10, for a +137 goal difference, 117 goals better than runners-up Ferencvaros.”Michael Peters can see that +117 and raise it. “If it counts, the Federated States of Micronesia finished their 2015 Pacific Games group stage with a goal difference of -114, which is very impressive considering they played only three games. Third placed Vanuatu ended on +45 (thanks to beating Micronesia 46-0), a jump of 159 goals.”Goal difference, bloody hell. If you can beat that, get in touch.“Has there ever been an occasion where a major team has been disrupted by jury service, with either a manager or a player being called up during the season?” James Schofield asked a few weeks back.“Plymouth’s Welsh international Carl Fletcher once tried to argue he couldn’t sit on a jury as he was too well known,” begins Andy Carswell.“According to reports in 2010, Judge Francis Gilbert told the midfielder that being Plymouth captain was not sufficient reason to excuse him, and that he had enough time to travel to Cheltenhamfor a Johnstone’s Paint Trophy tie after completing his duties.“Fletcher argued that his position meant he was in a position of potentially being threatened, saying: ‘I don’t want anything to come back on me for sitting on a jury.’ His protests fell on deaf ears, with Judge Gilbert adding: ‘Lots of well-known people, some more famous than you, have been required to sit on juries.’”“Is it true that Chilean players drank vodka during the 1962 World Cup because they thought it would help their chances of beating the USSR?” asked Steven Davison back in the summer of 2006.Incredibly, Steven, it is. During the group stage, the hosts employed an interesting new tactic of pre-game stereotypical eating: before the opening 3-1 win over Switzerland, they ate cheese, followed by a preparatory meal of spaghetti before the 2-0 success against Italy.Once in the quarter-finals, the Chileans prepared for their game with the mighty Soviets by downing a couple of Smirnoffs. The ploy actually worked and Chile went on to win 2-1. Coffee was the order of the day before the semi-final with Brazil, but although it perked them up no end in the morning, it couldn’t stop the Brazilians from winning 4-2 and going on to lift the trophy. Eduardo Galeano wrote in Soccer in Sun and Shadow that Chile “gobbled down spaghetti, chocolate, and vodka, but choked on the coffee”.For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive.Rotherham’s victory in the League One play-off final means that all of the three teams who dropped out of the Championship last season have secured an immediate return to the division (Wigan and Blackburn being the others). Are there any previous occasions where this has happened?” wonders Jonathan Hart.“Now that Swansea, Stoke and West Brom are gone and Cardiff and Fulham are in, the Premier League has never looked so alphabetically top-heavy. The 10th team are Huddersfield! Is this a record?” asks Mike McCarthy.“I was watching the highlights of Watford’s 2012-13 season recently and noticed that in the 6-1 win against Leeds, five of their goals were scored from outside the area,” says Will Paterson. “Are there any other examples of games with so many of the goals for one team coming from so far out?”“Which team has the worst record at Wembley Stadium?” asks Chris Beesley."

Paris Saint-Germain are going to sign Gianluigi Buffon on a free transfer. The former Juventus goalkeeper is unlikely to have much to do during Ligue 1 games, so he’ll have plenty of time to think about all those nasty things he said about Michael Oliver. Or he can start preparing ways to insult Neymar, who has made it clear to the French champions that he wants to join Real Madrid.Chelsea want to sign Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski, who has actually turned out to be a bit underwhelming at the very highest level. He misses a lot of big chances, doesn’t he? Still, the Poland striker will probably put himself about a bit more than Álvaro Morata. And he won’t have to worry about Willian blotting his face out of team photos either. Willian, it seems, is set for an emotional reunion with José Mourinho at Manchester United.There is, of course, no manager quite as imaginative to Mourinho. His response to United’s FA Cup final defeat to Chelsea will be to banish Anthony Martial to Tottenham Hotspur for the crime of not being the finished article at the age of 22 and buy Toby Alderweireld, Gareth Bale, Fred, Jorginho, Alex Sandro and Jean-Michaël Seri. Daley Blind, Matteo Darmian and Luke Shaw will also be bundled towards the door marked Do One, while Marouane Fellaini is in talks with Milan about a free transfer. While United plot a £250m spending spree, Manchester City are already closing in on their first signing of the summer. It seems that Riyad Mahrez won’t have to go on strike this time. The Leicester City winger is finally set to join the Premier League champions.Tottenham will replace Alderweireld with Ajax’s Matthijs De Ligt. Chelsea are going to ditch Antonio Conte for Maurizio Sarri, enabling Napoli to hire Carlo Ancelotti. Wolves are eyeing Marseille’s Bouna Sarr and Cameroon’s Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Aston Villa are worried that John Terry is going to zoom off to China or the USA. Liverpool want even more centre-backs; Jürgen Klopp likes the look of Burnley’s James Tarkowski and Newcastle United’s Jamaal Lascelles."

The clock, since you asked, kept on ticking. As the curtain fell on Hamburger SV’s unbroken presence in top flight since the Bundesliga’s formation in 1963, it was alone in maintaining steady hands (give or take it being digital). With the home side’s winning position futile, as Wolfsburg completed an eventually emphatic victory over Köln 170km to the south, any façade of holding it together began to crack.Pyrotechnics rained down from the ultras in the Nordtribüne and a heavy police presence took over the pitch in lines, with horses and dogs for company. Some of those waiting to see if the famous timepiece – adding every extra second to HSV’s ever-present tenure – would stop must have struggled to see it through thick plumes of black smoke.“It could,” wrote a seething Hamburger Morgenpost, “have been a very dignified descent from the Bundesliga. HSV wanted to leave the main stage of German football with their heads held high, but then the arsonists in Volkspark took over the command and destroyed this beautiful scene.” The newspaper’s ire had been shared by many of the other fans in the Volkspark, who whistled and chanted “Wir sind Hamburger und ihr nicht” at the ultras.On the pitch the players waited 15 minutes for the field to be cleared of objects, stewards, police and animals, desperate to complete the final few seconds of stoppage time. Tatsuya Ito, who had been one of HSV’s beacons of hope in the game, couldn’t hold back the tears any longer. Borussia Mönchengladbach, knowing their chance of snatching a European place had gone, could have done without their quarter-hour of purgatory too.It’s the hope, as they say, that kills you, and by this point all hope had been and gone. They had been ready for relegation for a couple of months, as we said in this column a few weeks back, clearing the decks in getting rid of chairman Heribert Bruchhagen and sporting director Jens Todt, and promoting reserve coach Christian Titz to seemingly do a glorified relegation stocktake. Titz actually inspired a thrilling run that was just too little, too late. The paradox of the club hitting a record low just as they completed a fourth Bundesliga win in six was not lost on people. “Right now,” Titz told Sky after the dust settled, “I feel a lot of disappointment, because I believed until the very end that us winning could be enough.”To channel this sort of response from a limited group of players – quite how limited was underlined by Bobby Wood’s thoroughly avoidable, yet almost laudable second-half red card for a second booking – was really something. With captain Gotoku Sakai emotionally pledging to stay at full-time, both automatically relegated clubs – extraordinarily - have a positive energy to them. The pair are representative of an unusual, and not always satisfying, Bundesliga season. There has been plenty of entertainment,the 36 goals rattled in on the final day showing that. Yet on a Saturday when even champions Bayern Munich, led in their title celebrations by Manuel Neuer (who’s still yet to play since September) and finished 21 points clear , managed to put a dampener on their own party by losing 4-1 at home to Stuttgart, acknowledging that there have been better seasons in the competition’s recent history quality-wise was inescapable.That was equally apparent in one of the day’s most meaningful fixtures, between Hoffenheim and Borussia Dortmund. Julian Nagelsmann and his players deserve enormous credit for surpassing even last season’s excellence, after their 3-1 win assured third place and Champions League qualification. The enormity of their achievements visibly hit the players, with Nadiem Amiri and Kevin Akpoguma among those collapsing in tears at full-time at an emotional Rhein-Neckar Arena. It was plain, however, that they got there at least partly through the shortcomings of others. One only had to look at their opponents. Dortmund squeezed into the top four too, by a whisker, having been left sweating by a defensive horror show. It was, as goalscorer Marco Reus told the cameras after the game, “symbolic of our whole season”.The restructure is already under way, with Matthias Sammer and Sebastian Kehl included and Lucien Favre expected to join from Nice. Departing coach Peter Stöger – unlike goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, who made a brief pre-retirement cameo in stoppage time to a big reception – may not be remembered as a Dortmund great, but there appears to be a degree of appreciation for him among supporters, with respect for his working manner, if not always for the quality of football his team produced. The Austrian inherited a team in eighth place and delivered them into the top four. That wasn’t a given. He is set to receive a €2m bonus for reaching the Champions League at the end of his 154 days in charge. So poor Leverkusen, having come so far under Heiko Herrlich and developed into one of the best teams to watch in the league, fell agonisingly short on goal difference after ending up level on points with Hoffenheim and Dortmund.The retiring Stefan Kießling saw a penalty, which he spotted up, rescinded by VAR when they were three up against Hannover, which could have made it even tighter, and Die Werkself subsequently let in a pair of late goals. In reality, losses to Dortmund and Stuttgart then a failure to win in Bremen leading up to this cost them, rather than the final day.With national debate about German clubs’ perceived underachievement in European competitions, many supporters and commentators hope 2018-19 sees an improvement in standards – a banquet of some substance, rather than a fast food fix.• Hats off to Stuttgart, then, who will qualify for the Europa League if Bayern win the DfB Pokal final against future coach Niko Kovac’s Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. Coach Tayfun Korkut said he would enjoy the final “with a glass of red wine”, and without tension, as he well deserves. After his appointment in place of the popular Hannes Wolf was widely criticised, Stuttgart took more points in the Rückrunde than any other team apart from Bayern.• The suspicion before the final day that HSV might have a chance was largely informed by the potential for Wolfsburg combusting at the moment of truth. Instead, Bruno Labbadia’s side stepped up from the moment Josuha Guilavogui’s fine strike gave them the lead 40 seconds in. They also recovered well from Jonas Hector’s equaliser to win 4-1, setting them up for Thursday’s play-off first leg against Holstein Kiel, who were in the third tier this time last year.• Leipzig also got off to a flier, with Dayot Upamecano giving them a lead inside 90 seconds at a Hertha Berlin who seemed dazzled by the visit of Ryan Reynolds. The real star of the show as the side qualified for Europe was Ademola Lookman, who scored and set up two more in a 6-2 victory. Bayer Leverkusen 3-2 Hannover, Bayern Munich 1-4 Stuttgart, Hamburg 2-1 Borussia Mönchengladbach, Hertha Berlin 2-6 RB Leipzig, Hoffenheim 3-1 Borussia Dortmund, Mainz 1-2 Werder Bremen, Freiburg 2-0 Augsburg, Schalke 1-0 Eintracht Frankfurt, Wolfsburg 4-1 Cologne"

A pair of Mohamed Salah’s mint green football boots are to enter the collection of the British Museum, to be displayed next to ancient Egyptian sandals in a gallery near its mummies.The boots, specially moulded for the shape of the Liverpool player’s feet, have been donated by Adidas to celebrate Salah winning the Golden Boot award for being this season’s top scorer in the Premier League.The footwear are an eye-catching, fun acquisition but one with a serious intent, the museum said. “The boots tell a story of a modern Egyptian icon, performing in the UK, with a truly global impact,” said Neal Spencer, the museum’s keeper of ancient Egypt and Sudan.Salah is this season’s footballing phenomenon, revered among Liverpool fans who call him the Egyptian king. He scored 32 Premier League goals in 2017-18, a record tally in a single 38-game season.The 25-year-old forward also has hero status in his home country and was a huge part of Egypt qualifying for this summer’s World Cup in Russia.The donation, believed to be the first football boots to enter the British Museum collection, is part of a wider modern Egypt project launched in 2016 to bolster its collection of contemporary Egyptian material.Spencer said the museum wanted to tell the story of day-to-day life in 20th- and 21st-century Egypt as well as ancient times covering topics which include sport, entertainment, international trade and design.The unused X17 Deadly Strike boots were this week photographed in front of the museum’s colossal statues of Ramesses II and Amenhotep III, but their first home from 24 May will be room 61, a gallery containing wall paintings from the tomb-chapel of Nebamun, a wealthy Egyptian official. They will be displayed near to ancient Egyptian footwear and gold pharaonic jewellery."

Ander Herrera has a self-possession that allows rare honesty when he is asked how Manchester City’s runaway title win and Liverpool potentially being European champions heightens Manchester United’s need to win the FA Cup final against Chelsea.Sitting upstairs in the academy building at the club’s Carrington base, the midfielder is an articulate speaker on a range of subjects. United finished second to City but, unless Chelsea are defeated at Wembley on Saturday, José Mourinho’s side will end the season without a trophy. The nightmare scenario is City’s 19-point Premier League success being followed by Liverpool claiming a sixth European Cup next Saturday by defeating Real Madrid.“If any player in the world tells you he doesn’t care about what the opponents do, he is lying,” Herrera says. “But I don’t go crazy with that. Last season we won three trophies [counting the Community Shield], this season we can still win one – it’s a 50-50 possibility. But I cannot lie to you. If I can choose at the beginning of the season who wins the Premier League and who wins the Champions League – if we couldn’t be champions – I wouldn’t tell you Manchester City and Liverpool.”Two years ago United won a 12th FA Cup and first since 2004 with a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace. Herrera was an unused substitute for Louis van Gaal that day. “Of course when you play you feel more happy but I was still very happy for the team,” the Spaniard says. “It was my first title in England and I knew we were building something good – I said that after the game. And I was right because the next season we won three trophies and this season we are fighting for another.”Herrera’s spell at United has featured an almost constant fight for a starting place. When named by Mourinho in the XI for the 3-2 derby win at the Etihad in April that was his first league start for four months, though he was injured for some of the period. After a fine display Herrera has started seven of their last eight matches, including the semi-final against Tottenham, in which he scored the winner.“When I don’t play, of course I am not happy, but I am also very happy with myself because I give everything, every day, every minute, to be on the pitch,” he says. “If I am on the pitch I’m very calm because I know I’ve done everything to be there. That’s the way to be and the way I’ll feel until the last day of my career.”Herrera, 28, is calm when assessing Mourinho’s management style. “I don’t think if you don’t take your chance it’s the last chance you have in the season,” says the Spaniard, who has made 38 appearances this term and scored twice. “I don’t go crazy when I don’t have my best game and say: ‘Oof, I’ve lost my chance, I’m not going to play again.’“I know some of my team-mates, and some footballers, are up and down. If I play well I’m not very happy and if I play badly I’m not very sad. My age and experience has helped me keep that balance. If you work hard and respect the ones who are playing at that moment but try to give everything you have, whether that’s five minutes or 30 minutes, sooner or later football is fair. I really believe that.”Herrera also offers advice to Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, who were criticised and dropped by Mourinho following the loss at Brighton two weeks ago. “I don’t like to talk about what other players think because, as we say in Spanish, every person is a world, their own world.“What I can say about them is that they are maybe two of the 20 most talented players in the world. If I could give them advice it’s if you work, then sooner or later football gives back what you have given.”In an FA Cup tie against Chelsea in March last year Herrera impressed when man‑marking Eden Hazard before being sent off after 35 minutes for a second yellow card. He did that job again in the league fixture a month later and was again effective against Chelsea’s best player as United won 2-0 and he scored the second. When discussing how he took the initiative that day, Herrera illustrates why he was talked of as a potential successor to Wayne Rooney as captain.“I was telling Marcus, Jesse [Lingard], Paul [Pogba] and [Marouane] Fellaini, who were in front of me, that all the time the more difficult the ball that comes in to Hazard, the easier the job is for me,” he says. “This is not about one player. I have to do my job but football is 11 players. If one player gets free with the ball and Hazard is with me, I’m dead. That guy has to have one of my team-mates on him, making it difficult.”Of the red card in the Cup meeting, Herrera says: “I was never going to hurt the opponent – one of the yellow cards was near the bench; they were not going to score a goal.”Despite United’s 81 points in second place being a record deficit to the 100 of City, Herrera is optimistic United can overhaul them next year. “Next season I think the champion can be with 85 or 86 points,” he says.“This season was an exception – it’s not normal that City have won [so many] games in the last minutes – I remember West Ham at home, Huddersfield away, Southampton, Bournemouth. If they draw all those games, maybe the champions would be six or seven points less.”Regarding what the long term may hold for him, Herrera says: “My future is the Cup final. I want to be here next season and unless the club sack me, I will be here in pre-season and fight to keep adding games to my total. In football, what today is black is tomorrow white.“So if you think about what can happen in the summer, maybe the club signs four midfielders and they don’t want me any more. The only thing I can do is train good today and train good tomorrow. That’s all I can say – and of course if the club wants to talk to me [to extend my contract, which runs out in June 2019] I will listen to them because I am happy here.”Helping United lift the FA Cup with a defeat of Chelsea would make Herrera even more content."

Thing is, what nobody knows is that a young Neymar had a dream. “One day,” he told his imaginary friend, Cecil, “I’ll play for every single one of the G-14 superclubs.” If today’s rags are to be believed, he will move one step closer by acting in a sufficiently brattish manner to make Paris Saint-Germain wearily decide that life’s too short and sell him to Real Madrid.If Neymar goes, PSG will endeavour to replace him with absolutely everybody, including Ryan Sessegnon. The Fulham sensation is also wanted by most of Her Majesty’s finest, including Spurs, Man Utd, Man City and Arsenal.PSG’s interest in Sessegnon could have an impact on the great property tree that is the transfer market. United, Arsenal and Chelsea are desirous of PSG’s current left-back Layvin Kurzawa. And who knows what that might also mean for Danny Rose’s employment status?Neymar, meanwhile, will be thrilled to hear that comically overrated galoot Edinson Cavani wants to follow him to Madrid – but he’ll be going to Atlético to replace Antoine Griezmann. For his part, Griezmann is wanted by, among others, Barcelona – who will sell weathered genius Luis Suárez if they get Madrid’s favourite Head and Shoulders shill.One of Europe’s brightest talents, Ajax forward Justin Kluivert, is bound for Roma. As usual, Ajax will be pillaged this summer: the talented young defender Matthijs de Ligt could join Spurs or Man City or Bayern or Barcelona. The choice is his, or his agent’s. Another teenage defender, Porto’s Diogo Leite, is wanted by Liverpool, Man City, Arsenal and – breaking news! – millions of Football Manager junkies.Arsenal are also keen to sign Bayer Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd ‘Poor’ Leno to replace the ageing Petr Cech and the peak-age-but-not-entirely-fit-for-purpose David Ospina. Wayne Rooney is still bound for America, just as he was 24 hours ago, though Wolves may attempt to change his flight plans.Rooney’s current club, Everton, have already decided to thank Sam Allardyce for his 11/10 services and replace him with Marco Silva. If that happens, there will be no Pep/Big Sam dilemma for Norwich’s James Maddison. He is being monitored by Spurs, Arsenal, Everton and Man City.Jack Wilshere will sign a new three-year contract with Arsenal, citing his desperation to play for whoever the next manager will be. Reports suggests it will be one of five men: Massimiliano Allegri, Patrick Vieira, Mikel Arteta, Joachim Löw or

I’ll leave you with that thought. Fulham are deservedly through to the Championship final after beating Derby 2-1 on aggregate and will play either Aston Villa or Middlesbrough at Wembley. Paul Macinnes was at Craven Cottage to report on a night to remember for Fulham. That’s all from me. Night!

We played very well and deserved this victory. The players trust in themselves. My job is to believe in them and they played very good football and showed great self-belief. Without confidence it is hard to play this kind of game.”

Here’s Mitrovic! “It is unbelievable. It is amazing. We got the result we wanted. I think we deserved it because we showed better football.”

Ryan Sessegnon speaks: “We said we were going to give it a go. It was special. We got the first goal. Thankfully I got it and we kept going. In the last few games we lost our way a bit but we got our composure back. We believe in our style of play and today it showed that if we keep going we’ll get our reward. I just play my normal game.

football,"• Manager wants players brave enough to criticise each other• Southgate welcomes Harry Kane’s display against Leicester
Dominic Fifield

Thu 17 May 2018 22.31 BST


First published on Thu 17 May 2018 12.00 BST

Gareth Southgate believes some of the young players in his England squad “do not know how good they might be” and has urged them to be brave enough to criticise each other and raise collective standards at the World Cup.A squad with an average age of just over 26, the third youngest selected by England to compete at the tournament, and only 442 caps combined will travel to Russia with Southgate hopeful they will transpose fearless club form on to the biggest stage.The manager praised their “athleticism, energy and pace” and, having seen many in the squad forge friendships while progressing through the national junior sides, hopes bonds will be strong enough for players to engage openly about each other’s performances.“The players we’ve picked are free [of inhibition], they’ve got a point to prove and are hungry,” said Southgate. “They have loads they want to do in their careers. That brings energy and competition right across the squad. They get on, and that’s a starting point. The next stage is that they start to pull each other, raising standards of how we train, getting hold of each other on the pitch. Just getting on isn’t enough. We’ve got to go deeper than that.“They must not be afraid of upsetting each other. They have to be brave enough to have conversations that need to be had. It’s one of the things that makes a winning team: when you’re comfortable enough with each other so that, when you have those conversations, it is not held against you. You move on quickly from it. It is recognised as trying to get the best out of each other.“I see such exciting players coming through. Some of them, I don’t think they know how good they might be. I watched Ruben Loftus-Cheek at Crystal Palace and he was having a huge impact on the game, but there’s still more to come. He’s 6ft 4in, he’s technically outstanding, he can dribble and beat players, he can retain the ball, he can slide passes … I’m thinking, go on, go again. He just needs to keep progressing and he needs time to do that. That applies to so many of them.”Only five members of the 23-man party have World Cup experience and Southgate accepts his players will learn on the hoof. The team will be accompanied by the psychologist Dr Pippa Grange, the head of people and team development at the FA, who is charged with changing the culture and mindset of England sides, and increasing their “psychological resilience”.“Pippa was with us in March and will come with us to the finals,” Southgate said. “She is not just there for psychology and it is not the answer to everything that we might do, but she will be a strong and important addition to the team.”Southgate welcomed Harry Kane’s two-goal performance against Leicester City on the Premier League’s final day. The Tottenham Hotspur forward endured a difficult Euro 2016, his first taste of a major finals, but his double offered timely reassurance the striker is back close to his best after signs of rustiness following a month out with an ankle problem.The manager was less impressed by a tweet, posted on the official FA Cup account after Spurs’ semi-final defeat to Manchester United, asking: “What’s that in your pocket, Chris?” before linking to an unrelated video of Chris Smalling saying: “Harry Kane.” The post was deleted, with Mauricio Pochettino describing the incident as “an embarrassment”.“We immediately recognised it wasn’t an area we need to be involved in,” said Southgate, who spoke personally to Kane about the tweet. “We had an apology pretty quickly, to Harry and to Tottenham. So it’s done. What I saw from Harry from the last couple of games is that he was starting to get more shots on target. So, for me, it was a comfort finish to the season. I’m happy he’ll be in a good place.”Kane, who is spending this week in the Bahamas, will report to St George’s Park on Sunday as the bulk of the squad convenes to begin preparations. The Watford midfielder Nathaniel Chalobah, who returned on the final afternoon after an absence of eight months with a fractured knee cap, and Manchester City’s young goalkeeper, Angus Gunn, will add to the numbers in the absence of players from Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool. Lewis Cook, one of five players placed on standby, will be permitted to play for the under-21s in the Toulon tournament.England play two friendlies, against Nigeria at Wembley and Costa Rica at Elland Road, before departing for Repino on 12 June in which the manager hopes to scrutinise “a few combinations and options we might turn to within games”. The squad will also undertake an internal practice match before leaving for Russia."

Slavisa Jokanovic opted for some sporting cross‑pollination when asked whether, after two and a half years of battles won and lost, Fulham’s promotion from the Championship felt especially sweet. “Like in tennis, we lost one match point,” he said. “But today we smashed the second match point. We are a Premier League team.”They are, and Jokanovic could feel welcome to all the emphatic language he liked. A double-fault would have been crushing for Fulham, whose charge towards automatic promotion blew up against Birmingham on a hard, well‑grown pitch that perplexed their players and seemed to have laid bare a soft underbelly. Instead their manager can reflect on deserved victory over forces that had at one stage cast his tenure into doubt and could sense that, having so successfully got his own way once, he has enough credit built up to get it again.“I prefer not so much to think about bad things, about problems,” Jokanovic, palpably in celebration mode as a beery, bubbly, bouncing Fulham dressing room cavorted a few metres away, said after it was suggested that victory at Wembley against Aston Villa may have brought a sense of vindication.Relations within Fulham were strained while Jokanovic was under the leash of Craig Kline’s algorithm‑based transfer policy, a situation that ended with Kline’s departure in October. The Serb was duly allowed to sign Matt Targett and Aleksandar Mitrovic on loan during the January transfer window and it is doubtful, particularly given the latter’s 12-goal return, whether he would be disposed to quite such sanguine thinking now if those deals had not been completed.Further internal power struggles would be a damaging distraction before a top-flight season in which, given calm waters, there is little reason to expect Fulham should struggle. Their owner, Shahid Khan, strode jauntily – it would be too easy to say “proprietorially” – out of the stadium he fancies buying but the serious business will soon start again and Jokanovic should start talks over transfer strategy from a commanding position.“It depends what kind of ambition we are going to show, this is simple,” he said of Fulham’s prospects for 2018-19. “Next year we’re going to be in the Premier League, not competing in the Championship. We need to be brave, we need to make investment, we need to spend money to survive or to make a more important step. It’s not so complicated to understand.”Khan will, presumably, hear that at closer quarters soon and Jokanovic’s cause may be strengthened given that his own capabilities have not gone unnoticed elsewhere. An earlier link with Chelsea may have been dismissed but the idea was not completely outrageous and it would be folly to risk things coming apart at the seams now.“It’s probably the best football of my career,” Mitrovic said before leaving Wembley. “Of course I will be happy to stay at Fulham but we will see what happens and we will speak to my agent and other clubs.”Jokanovic will expect to agree a permanent deal with Newcastle for his countryman for starters and will also hope Ryan Sessegnon – “I prefer to stay with him and what I know is that the kid wants to stay too,” he said – is induced to stay another year before his inevitable progression to a Champions League club.For Villa these must seem first‑world problems now. Steve Bruce, ashen-faced afterwards and clearly ready for a break after a traumatic six months, will almost certainly have to rebuild in their third and final year of parachute payments. Jack Grealish, the best player on the pitch against Fulham despite seeing the artist‑artisan balance tilted firmly against his side, asked Villa’s press officer to shield him from the media as he walked through the mixed zone and it would be a leap of faith to predict him talking as their player again.John Terry is out of contract and the outstanding loan goalkeeper Sam Johnstone will surely find a top‑tier club to sign him permanently from Manchester United while Alan Hutton, Mile Jedinak and James Chester are all creaking. From Championship big guns upon their relegation in 2016 they face a battle to avoid flailing among the many also-rans who have fading memories of glories past.“You have to get together and go again next season,” their left-back Ahmed Elmohamady said. Exactly how many of them do remains to be seen; the same question may be asked of Fulham but, when his next test of wills comes around, Jokanovic should have a crashing overhead volley up his sleeve."
football,"One of the coaches to have defeated Zidane’s side this season advises Liverpool to keep the ball and warns of Madrid’s ‘anarchy’Quique Setién

Thu 24 May 2018 15.55 BST


First published on Thu 24 May 2018 15.30 BST

This Champions League final is a game that in theory should finish 4-4. It could be very entertaining for the fans, but perhaps not for the coaches. Real Madrid are a team who are a little anarchic. They don’t have a permanent shape: although they will play with four at the back and with Casemiro, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric in the middle, the way they set up from there can change. Cristiano Ronaldo may be through the middle or wider and much depends on his role. If he and Karim Benzema play, it tends to be 4-4-2 but Gareth Bale could start, and/or Isco, Lucas Vázquez or Marco Asensio. All mean different things for the shape.That anarchic nature is more a general point, though. Madrid’s players are carried along by the football itself, what they feel in each moment; they’re not guided by tactical rigour or a specific structure. What defines Madrid is their individual ability, how they associate with each other intuitively. Look at players like Benzema, who drifts to the wings and combines, or the full-backs, Marcelo and Dani Carvajal: when Carvajal goes up he doesn’t look to see if the other full-back is deep and that open approach often compromises them defensively.In the middle there’s more control. Liverpool could try to pressure Modric to deny them that, but he has so much ability to carry the ball, overcome difficulties, find passes. His play depends more on team-mates offering options than on the opposition. He and Kroos understand each other well, their positioning and passing is excellent. With Casemiro, they are the only players who maintain a certain order. I’ve very rarely seen Modric lose the ball – he always makes the right decision.Madrid’s anarchy can make planning difficult: they’re unpredictable. But if you can be defensively sound and use the ball well, making the most of the space they leave, you can do them damage. We’ve seen throughout the season that Madrid concede a lot of chances. And if you can keep the ball, you can reduce their opportunities.We won 1-0 at the Bernabéu but we had much more difficulty then than in the second game, which we lost 5-3. At the Bernabéu we scored in the last minute. We’d been under pressure, although it’s also true that we’d tried to keep possession. We wanted the players to stay calm: have faith, choose passes well, be intelligent, keep it, make them run. We knew that chances would come. And although we had to resist, although the tiredness meant we were sometimes less precise than we wanted, that was what happened.At the Benito Villamarín we controlled practically the whole game, except for 15 minutes in the second half when they were superior, scored and turned it round. You can’t do anything about the ability Madrid have when they get the ball, combine and attack: they have extraordinary players, capable of creating danger or scoring easily. We talked to the players about the need to keep the ball. Because Madrid’s forwards don’t always press, that facilitated prolonged possession. And if you keep the ball, even if you’re not going to generate much with it, you can take control.That was how we set it up and that was the way it worked ... except that we lost. And that’s the thing. We were 2-1 up at half-time, and should have been further ahead, but they scored three from the 50th minute to the 65th; we then made it 3-4 with five minutes left but they scored again in the 92nd. This is the issue: Madrid have 15 minutes and it’s the perfect storm. There will always be moments when you lose the ball – that’s unavoidable. Against some teams the repercussions aren’t serious. But if Modric gets it, he delivers a wonderful pass ... if Bale gets it, with the speed he has ... if Cristiano reaches a cross or produces a move ... you know they can hurt you, and that was exactly what happened. We had the game perfectly controlled, but you need lots of chances to score; they need far fewer.Up front Liverpool have extraordinary players. It’s true that their capacity to defend is weaker but they can hurt Madrid because they have fast, intelligent footballers. When Madrid attack they lose shape and Liverpool can harm them. But, of course, Madrid can do Liverpool damage too. These two are better going forward than going backwards.That said, it’s important to make a point here: in big, important games Madrid tend to be much more rigorous defensively, they’re not as mad; they don’t play with that sense of superiority, as if they know they’ll win. And if they are more solid, Liverpool will struggle more – just as Madrid will struggle to generate opportunities if Liverpool tighten up. But teams don’t change overnight. It’s unlikely Marcelo or Carvajal will stop going forward, that Cristiano, Benzema or Modric will change. Even if you tell them to defend permanently, they won’t. And Liverpool are similar. You’re not going to tell them to just defend. It could be very entertaining.Interview by Sid Lowe"

Emre Can will formally complete a move from Liverpool to Juventus after Saturday’s Champions League final, with the midfielder poised to sign a five-year contract with the Italian club.Can has long been linked with a switch to Turin having declined to sign a contract extension at Anfield. His current deal expires at the end of next month, at which point he will be able to join Juventus on a free transfer. The Serie A champions are expected to pay Can €5m a season in wages.Can’s departure is a blow for Liverpool. Having joined the club from Bayer Leverkusen in 2014 , the 24-year-old has become an important part of Jürgen Klopp’s side, offering drive and authority from central midfield.Klopp was desperate to keep hold of his compatriot but will go into his third full season in charge of Liverpool without the player, although the manager’s midfield options will be bolstered by the arrival of Naby Keïta from RB Leipzig.Can has not played for Liverpool since sustaining a back injury in mid-March. He was part of the squad that trained at Anfield on Monday before Saturday’s meeting with Real Madrid in Kiev. Should the German take part in that match it looks set to be his last appearance for Liverpool.Speaking on Monday, Klopp remained coy about Can’s future. He said: “No clue [about a move to Juventus]. Not important in the moment to be honest. In this moment he is 100% here and that is the only thing I am interested in.”Meanwhile, Massimiliano Allegri had a meeting with Juventus’s directors and told them that he intends to stay on as manager next season. The 50-year-old, who has led Juve to four successive Serie A titles, has been linked with the managerial vacancy at Arsenal."

“What’s the most number of times that a team has hit the woodwork in the same game?” asks Ally McPhail.Let’s start by looking at a couple of examples of teams who hit the woodwork multiple times in the same attack. Earlier this season Duisburg whacked wood four times in a few seconds against Fortuna Düsseldorf, and Brazil did so three times during the foreplay to Roberto Dinamite’s goal against Poland at the 1978 World Cup.As for multiple woodwork-rattling across a whole match, the first game that comes to mind is from Euro 96. The Czech Republic drew 3-3 with Russia, a result that put them through to the quarter-finals ahead of Italy, and also hit the woodwork four times from a variety of angles and distances.At least they got the result they needed – as did Chelsea in the 2010 FA Cup final, when they hit the woodwork five times in a goalless first half against Portsmouth. They eventually won the match 1-0 and did the double.Back when they were still a comedy club, Manchester City battered Bolton at the Etihad Stadium at the start of the 2005-06 season. They hit the woodwork five times, and then lost 1-0 to an injury-time penalty from Gary Speed.That tale of woe was topped in Nuremberg in 2012, when Germany beat Kazakhstan 4-1 in a World Cup qualifier – and hit the woodwork six times. The same happened in the Southern League West in January, when Evesham United were repeatedly denied during a 2-1 defeat at Yate Town.Six times! Can you top that? If so, you know what to do.“If Manchester United beat Chelsea on Saturday, will José Mourinho be the first manager to win the FA Cup with two different clubs?” wonders Ellie Parker.Mourinho won the FA Cup in 2007, when Chelsea beat Manchester United 1-0 after extra-time in a game that the BBC co-commentator Mark Lawrenson described as a “great advert for cricket”. We know José loves a bit of the old heritage, so he’s probably aware that he wouldn’t be the first. It’s been done twice before. The first man to achieve the feat, and so many other feats, was the remarkable Herbert Chapman: he won the cup with Huddersfield in 1922 and Arsenal in 1930.In a sense, Billy Walker’s achievement was even more notable, because his second cup win was 24 years after the first. He won it with Sheffield Wednesday in 1935 and Nottingham Forest in 1959.Mourinho wouldn’t even be the first manager to win it for and against the same club, as Chapman’s Arsenal beat Huddersfield in 1930. But he would be the first to win it for and against two clubs, so he can still be special.“Had a goalkeeper ever been sent off for a second yellow during a penalty shoot-out prior to the Republic of Ireland v Netherlands U17s game?” tweets Daryl Bolger, among others.Yes, is the rather abrupt answer. In November 2017, Qatar’s U19 goalkeeper Shehab Mamdouh was sent off after receiving a second booking, having made what he thought was a match-winning save during a penalty shootout. Qatar had a much happier outcome than Ireland’s young team, however. Their captain, Nasser Abdulsalam, stepped in to face the retake, and managed to save it. The shoot-out win ensured that Qatar qualified for the AFC U19 Championship finals. There’s also the 2003 case of the Botswana goalkeeper and captain Modiri Marumo, but he was shown a straight red for punching a Malawi opponent during their Castle Cup shoot-out.Last week we looked at players who had been made to trim their facial fuzz by a manager or chairman. Norman Biggar has more:“When Dougie Bell moved from Aberdeen to Rangers in 1985, he was forced to shave off his moustache as Rangers’ policy at the time was that all players should be clean shaven. A special allowance had previously been made to allow John Greig to grow a beard for the 1972 Cup Winners’ Cup final, to protect the stitches on his chin from being nicked by a razor. Less than a year after Bell’s arrival, a hirsute Graeme Souness was installed as player-manager and that particular signing policy was immediately dropped, soon to be followed by the dropping of other ‘unofficial’ policies.”“A friend of mine was telling me the other day about an Icelandic referee who disallowed a goal because his teeth had fallen out,” said Jon Bennett in 2008. “Am I right to assume he was talking bobbins?”Technically, Jon was right to assume that, but only because the referee in question was actually Danish. Henning Erikstrup had been preparing to whistle for full-time on Noerager’s 4-3 win over Ebeltoft when his false teeth fell out of his mouth and on to the pitch. Ebeltoft equalised moments later, only for Erikstrup, who had not even seen the goal, to immediately rule it out on the grounds he would have whistled before it went in. “I had to get my teeth back before some player put his big foot on them,” parped the official afterwards when asked why he didn’t just whistle without them in.• Take a trip to the font of nerdvana in our archive“Given that they pick players for sticker albums in advance of the squads being announced, what has been the most glaring Panini omission?” enquires Dan Leach.“Swedish international Robert Gojani this week managed to score an own goal and receive a red card in the first 19 minutes of Elfsborg’s 5-0 defeat to Häcken,” writes Joe Murphy. “Is this the fastest a player has managed the unwanted double?”“I’ve recently discovered that, in Nigeria, Dundee United is slang for ‘idiot’ or ‘fool’, apparently the result of a disastrous tour they played there in the Jim McLean days,” mails Nicholas Reid. “Are there any similar examples of football club names becoming slang terms around the world?”“Has anyone picked up a manager of the season gong while also managing a relegated club?” asks Kári Tulinius.“I notice that Hull finished this season 18th in the Championship with a goal difference of 0, while the team directly below them, Birmingham, had a goal difference of -30,” mails Christopher Harding. “Is this the largest goal difference, um, difference between two teams finishing next to one another?”"

Exeter City booked their place in the League Two play-off final with a 3-1 victory over Lincoln City at St James Park.After a goalless draw in the first leg, Exeter held a narrow lead at the break thanks to Jayden Stockley’s neat finish. Lincoln thought they had levelled in the 40th minute when Elliott Whitehouse lashed the ball in from close range, but the goal was disallowed for an apparent handball by Matt Rhead, much to the anger of the visiting players.Hiram Boateng doubled the advantage early in the second half with an excellent goal. He picked the ball up on halfway and ran at the heart of the Lincoln defence. As the defenders backed off, he unleashed a superb left-footed curler from 25 yards that flew in off the inside of the post.But that was not their best goal of the night as Ryan Harley finished off Lincoln with a shot just inside the post from 25 yards to make it 3-0.Lincoln did at least give their travelling fans something to cheer when Matt Green scored late on. Tempers flared after Rhead and Exeter’s Jordan Moore-Taylor clashed heads, leading to them needing bandages and to seven minutes’ stoppage time.Paul Tisdale, the Exeter manager, said: “I think we thoroughly deserved it. I think it was a purposeful performance full of intent and as positive as we could have given.“We wanted to be really tough today and obviously we saw a lot on Saturday with the problems that Lincoln can cause any team and we acknowledged it.”Exeter will face Notts County or Coventry at Wembley on 28 May."

West Ham United may just have pulled off the summer’s managerial coup by appointing Manuel Pellegrini, affectionately known as This Charming Man.The Chilean’s sobriquet is taken from a Smiths song and was given by adoring Manchester City fans during the success-soaked years of 2013-16. Pellegrini was, indeed, the epitome of a genteel presence, never resorting to bitterness or sniping. More importantly, though, he combined this human quality with the hard edge required to be a winner.In handing Pellegrini a three-year contract and up to £7m annual salary, David Sullivan and David Gold have made him the club’s highest-paid manager and the West Ham co-owners should be optimistic that their investment will be rewarded. Pellegrini has been a manager for 30 years and this is his 13th club across six countries – Chile, Ecuador, Argentina, Spain, England and most recently China.Pellegrini won cups with Universidad Católica in Chile, and titles at Quito (Ecuador), San Lorenzo and River Plate (both Argentina), though before arriving at City his only European trophy was Villarreal’s 2004 Intertoto Cup success. Yet taking Villarreal to a Champions League semi-final and quarter-final impressed Real Madrid, who appointed him in the summer of 2009.What followed was a then-record 96 points, though his side finished second to the Lionel Messi-led Barcelona, who accumulated 99.This resumé shows Pellegrini can handle big-ego players and budgets of different scales. At City and Real, Pellegrini enjoyed endless finance, though he was trophyless and admitted to scant control over recruitment at the latter. At Villarreal (2004-09) and Málaga (2010-13) there were more modest budgets and he a found a way to elevate each.The mood music from some West Ham fans about succeeding David Moyes is muted despite Pellegrini remaining City’s most successful manager of the Premier League era, even following Pep Guardiola’s breathtaking 2017-18 campaign.Pellegrini won a Premier League and League Cup double in his first season in England. He was unable to defend the title – only José Mourinho and Sir Alex Ferguson have managed the feat in the post-1992 era – but responded by guiding City to a further League Cup triumph and a Champions League semi-final against Real in his final year.The latter achievement can be rated particularly noteworthy given how Pellegrini was left a dead man walking when City confirmed in February of that season that Guardiola would replace him. Pellegrini was undermined and more than a little annoyed. Yet he kept his anger private, in keeping with an ultra-professionalism that, with his balanced temperament and shrewd intelligence, marks him as one of the premier managers working in Europe.He may not be in the super-class of Mourinho or Guardiola but the man known as the Engineer is a high-class operator. When achieving that double at City he matched the feat Mourinho accomplished in his first term on these shores. And he did so in the wake of a Roberto Mancini four-year tenure that had become ever more chaotic. It featured a fall-out with Carlos Tevez in which the Argentinian flew home during a near-six-month strike in the championship-winning season of 2011-12; and the following year’s title defence had the Italian embroiled in an embarrassing training ground bust-up with Mario Balotelli.What City required, and got, in Pellegrini was a manager who could steady the club, move it on from the turbulent tenure of the Italian, and deliver. Aged 60 when he took control, Pellegrini proved himself instantly.Pellegrini can be billed as the antithesis of David Moyes and the Scot’s predecessor-but-one, Sam AllardyceHe did so playing a more attractive football than Mancini deployed: an attack-first mode that thrilled City fans. By February Pellegrini’s team had piled up 115 goals in all competitions and they would sweep to the title with 102 league goals.Pellegrini’s low-key demeanour is the polar opposite of the front-foot-first style he demands on the field. This can annoy some correspondents who interpret it as an unwillingness to engage properly. Supporters, though, will not care less. What they will want is results while playing the West Ham Way, a shorthand for a kind of free-flowing football.In this context they can be supremely content, as Pellegrini can be billed as the antithesis of Moyes and the Scot’s predecessor-but-one, Sam Allardyce.At City the prevailing criticism of Pellegrini was how entrenched his approach was. The attack-at-all costs ethos could make him look tactically naive, as it did in Champions League last-16 defeats by Barcelona in consecutive seasons, when his side were knocked out 4-1 and 3-1 on aggregate.Yet a sense says Pellegrini should be cute enough to temper his West Ham team when required, while harnessing the attacking talents of Michail Antonio, Manuel Lanzini, Marko Arnautovic, Javier Hernández and Andy Carroll.If so the new manager will offer entertainment to lift the mood at the London Stadium. This is dearly required following the serious disquiet of last season that was aimed at the board, and the team’s often listless displays."

The Tottenham support chanted that they were going home and there is excitement among their number at the prospect of returning to the rebuilt White Hart Lane next season. Yet what a send-off they gave to Wembley.The merits of the club’s temporary accommodation at the national stadium have been a talking point throughout a season that has finished with them securing third place in the Premier League and a third consecutive Champions League qualification.Spurs started badly at Wembley but they grew into the old place and they can look back on a handful of outstanding wins against Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal in the league, plus Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid in the Champions League.On the other hand the three defeats that Mauricio Pochettino feels have scarred the season were also here – against Juventus in the Champions League, Manchester City in the league and Manchester United in the FA Cup. This victory against a spirited Leicester City will stand the test of time mainly for its wackiness. The entertainment value, however, was rich.On an afternoon when defending was clearly not a part of either team’s plans, Tottenham trailed 3-1 before storming back to lead 4-3 thanks to a pair of Erik Lamela goals and an unwitting assist from him for the other one. Jamie Vardy found the equaliser for Leicester with his second of the game before Harry Kane – who else? – sealed it for Spurs with a second of his own.Tottenham had invited a host of their former players to the game and one of them, Paul Gascoigne, who was presented on the pitch at half-time, could be seen performing The Floss dance up in the stands when Kane’s winner went in. Around him Gary Mabbutt smiled, Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa applauded and Dimitar Berbatov just looked cool.Kane finished with 30 league goals for the season but it was not enough to overhaul Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah in the race for the Golden Boot. Kane had won the award in the previous two seasons with 25 and 29 goals.Leicester played a full part in a see‑saw spectacle and they will wonder how they went home with nothing other than a fifth defeat in seven league matches. The focus will now turn to the future of the manager, Claude Puel, but it is fair to say that his players performed for him here. “Speculation is not my area,” Puel said. “We need stability. I will try to make this work. This is just the second time in 18 years we have finished in the first half of the table.”The game exploded into life at the outset, with Vardy in the mood. He put Leicester in front with a flicked header from Riyad Mahrez’s free-kick but Tottenham hit back when Danny Simpson’s loose pass hit Lucas Moura and Kane was away. He beat Eldin Jakupovic with a low shot inside the near post.Tottenham had lost Jan Vertonghen to a calf problem in the warm-up and so Pochettino reshuffled, bringing Victor Wanyama into the line-up in midfield and dropping Eric Dier back to central defence, where he partnered Toby Alderweireld. Kyle Walker‑Peters enjoyed a rare opportunity at right‑back and he suffered, at times, defensively yet he looked good going forward. It was pretty much the story of every player’s day.Leicester were back in charge with 16 minutes on the clock and the goal owed much to an incision from Kelechi Iheanacho. Walker-Peters and Vardy challenged for a loose ball and, when it broke for Mahrez, he banged past Hugo Lloris. Leicester ought to have been further in front on 26 minutes but Demarai Gray could not beat Lloris when one-on-one, after Vardy’s lovely touch. Spurs were booed off by some of their supporters at the interval.It was even crazier in the second half, with Iheanacho making it 3-1 with the goal of the game – a precision left-footed drive into the top corner, after holding off Wanyama, which is no mean feat. Game over? Not at all. Spurs were in front 13 minutes later.Lamela scored his team’s second and fourth goals from low Walker‑Peters crosses while the equaliser for 3-3 came when Harry Maguire jumped into a challenge on him. The ball ricocheted off Lamela and went in off Christian Fuchs for an own goal.Back came Leicester and after Lloris had saved brilliantly to keep out Iheanacho, Mahrez ushered in Vardy, who finished explosively into the near top corner. Kane created the winner for himself with a move that sent the Leicester substitute, Hamza Choudhury off towards Brent Cross. He bent his shot expertly into the far corner. Though Vardy fired high when well placed in stoppage-time, there would be no further twists."

Police will issue England fans with a guide to “sensitive sites” in Volgograd and warn them not to sing inappropriate songs around them or to hang flags on them to avoid provoking a violent reaction from locals.Between 7,000 and 10,000 England supporters are expected to travel to Russia for the World Cup, around 2,000 of whom have tickets for the first group match against Tunisia in Volgograd, formerly known as Stalingrad.Police are cautiously confident the relative high cost of travelling to Russia coupled with visa requirements and football banning orders will avoid a repeat of the violent clashes which marred Euro 2016 in France and left two England fans seriously injured.A team led by chief inspector Joseph Stokoe travelled to Volgograd in February to discuss security with local police, who promised the country wanted to host a “festival of football”. But fans will be encouraged to modify their behaviour around historical monuments in the city, many of which pay tribute to the estimated 1.8m who lost their lives in the Battle of Stalingrad, the bloodiest battle of the second world war.“It’s fine to hang flags in the stadium,” Stokoe said, “or in a pub where you are paying customers and the owner is OK with it.”Mark Roberts, the national lead for football policing, said fans should steer clear of displaying flags on the street, particularly given the current political tensions between Russia and the west. “Any student of history will know that the Russian casualties at the Battle of Stalingrad were horrific,” he said.“The memorials there are particularly sensitive and I’m asking fans to show cultural awareness. Flags are an interesting issue. People should be really careful with flags. It can come across as almost imperialistic and it can cause antagonism.”England’s third group game against Belgium, which could decide whether they advance to the knockout stage of the tournament, has been identified by many as a potential flashpoint for fan violence. It will be held in Kaliningrad, a Russian outpost which has a land border with Poland. But Roberts warned fans planning to travel into Russia that way could be left disappointed.“I predict there will be a number of fans who get only as far as the queue for the border,” he said. “It will not be porous, it will be just as difficult to access as the other two group matches. We’ve been told that fans can expect a minimum of a four-hour queue at the border even with fan ID.”The police will be sending a team of spotters out to Russia to engage with fans, warn them when their behaviour risks provoking a negative reaction and identify known troublemakers. Individuals who already have football banning orders, currently 1,751 people, will be unable to travel and have been told to hand their passports to police by 4 June at the latest."

David Moyes has a post-match chat, and sounds a little pre-exitish to me. Is he happy with that point?Very much so, if you get a point against Manchester United it’s always a good result. The attitude of the players was fantastic and they want about their job really well tonight. I’d have been happy to take the point. If we can win it, great, but a point would be a good result for us. The players went about it really well. Their attitude, their commitment throughout the game was great. We’re trying to move up the league if we can. I don’t know if it moves us, but it’s one extra point.How big an achievement is it to have kept the club up?It’s a big achievement for us. It’s been a tough job but a really good job. I’ve really enjoyed it. The players have worked hard. We had to get them in order and playing a bit better, and I think overall across the piece we’ve done that.

Chris Smalling talks. He’s asked if getting a point tonight was a success:I think it is. Going into the game we knew second spot was ours for the taking. Tonight was the opportunity, with a game to spare. We’ve played [a back three] a few times this year, but not for a little while. I think it shows we can play both formations. If we show we can play a few formations, it’s up our sleeve. I’m comfortable with three or four. Would a Cup victory make this a successful season?If you do it makes it a very good season. We finished second, we’d have liked to win it but there’s progress, and if we can win the Cup final it would make it a very good season.

Not necessarily a damning statistic – defences are important and stuff – but it is also illustrative.19 - Since Sir Alex Ferguson retired at the end of the 2012-13 season, no Premier League team has drawn more matches nil-nil than Manchester United (19, level with Southampton). Dull.

That was David De Gea’s 18th clean sheet of the season. Apparently this means he wins his first Cadbury’s Golden Gloves Award. This award has existed for 13 years, and I’ve only just realised.

There were some shots in that game, but no proper actual goalscoring chances at all.

82 mins: Arnautovic is released down the left again, and this time he checks back and lifts a cross towards Carroll. It’s nearly perfect, but Jones stretches his neck muscles to flick it away. Carroll picks it up, but his cross goes over Arnautovic and drops to a defender, with no other West Ham player much interested in joining the attack.

9.22pm BST
21:22

80 mins: Chance for West Ham! Noble lifts the ball over the United defence, and Arnautovic runs onto it and, from out to the left of goal, flings his left foot at it as it drops. It would, had the volley flown in, have been a superb goal. It didn’t.Updated

56 mins: “I must take issue with Justin Kavanagh’s opinion that ‘They’ve become a dull, colourless team under [Jose]’,” writes Dan Lewis. “Manchester United were a dull colourless team under Moyes, became a somehow even duller and ever more devoid of colour team under Van Gaal, and Mourinho has certainly improved the quality of football from that low. Hard not to, you could argue, especially with the money available, but let’s not rewrite history here. Even Ferguson’s post-Ronaldo teams were rather drab.” This is undoubtedly true. This isn’t a particularly thrilling United side, but it’s a long way from Van Gaal levels of tedium.

8.57pm BST
20:57

55 mins: Lingard has yet another shot. It’s a decent good one, straight down the middle of goal but dipping nastily at pace as Adrián has to deal with it. He can’t catch it, but he can stop it rolling dangerously away from him, and he gathers in short order.

Álvaro Morata has paid the price for an indifferent season at Chelsea after being left out of Spain’s 23-man World Cup squad.The striker has become a peripheral figure at Chelsea since the January arrival of Olivier Giroud and will not be involved in Russia after the Spain coach Julen Lopetegui went with Diego Costa, Iago Aspas and Rodrigo as his strikers.“It’s always a difficult decision,” Lopetegui said. “There wasn’t anything negative about [Morata]. But we thought there were other players in the position who could help us.”“Best of luck in the World Cup,” Morata wrote on Twitter. “I’ll be supporting and cheering through the end, as always.”Instead of picking a fourth striker, Lopetegui opted to take eight defenders, including Arsenal’s Nacho Monreal, the only other surprise on the list. Chelsea’s Marcos Alonso and Marc Bartra were among the defenders left out.The squad features six players from Real Madrid and four from Barcelona. The Madrid players will report to the team’s training camp later than the other players because of their Champions League final commitments against Liverpool.Meanwhile, England’s Group G opponents Belgium have picked Christian Benteke despite his lack of goals for Crystal Palace in their preliminary 28-man squad. The striker, who scored just three times in the Premier League last season, got the nod from Roberto Martínez while Liverpool’s Divock Origi misses out.The Roma midfielder Radja Nainggolan reacted to missing out of the squad by announcing his international retirement.In a message on Instagram, he wrote: “Very reluctantly my international career comes to an end...I’ve always done everything I could to represent my country Being yourself can be bothering ...From this day on I will be the first fan...”Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku and Kevin De Bruyne were all included but there was also no place in Martínez’s squad for Everton’s Kevin Mirallas.Goalkeepers: David De Gea (Manchester United), Pepe Reina (Napoli), Kepa Arrizabalaga (Athletic Bilbao)Defenders: Jordi Alba (Barcelona), César Azpilicueta (Chelsea), Nacho Monreal (Arsenal), Dani Carvajal (Real Madrid), Nacho Fernández (Real Madrid), Gerard Piqué (Barcelona), Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid), Álvaro Odriozola (Real Sociedad)Midfielders: Thiago Alcantara (Bayern Munich), Sergio Busquets (Barcelona), Andrés Iniesta (Barcelona), Jorge “Koke” Resurreccion (Atletico Madrid), Saul Ňiguez (Atletico Madrid), Marco Asensio (Real Madrid), David Silva (Manchester City), Lucas Vázquez (Real Madrid), Francisco “Isco” Alarcón (Real Madrid)Forwards: Iago Aspas (Celta Vigo), Rodrigo (Valencia), Diego Costa (Atletico Madrid)Goalkeepers: Thibaut Courtois (Chelsea), Simon Mignolet (Liverpool), Koen Casteels (Wolfsburg), Matz Sels (Newcastle United)Defenders: Toby Alderweireld (Tottenham Hotspur), Dedryck Boyata (Celtic), Laurent Ciman (LAFC), Leander Dendoncker (Anderlecht), Christian Kabasele (Watford), Vincent Kompany (Manchester City), Jordan Lukaku (Lazio), Thomas Meunier (Paris Saint-Germain), Thomas Vermaelen (Barcelona), Jan Vertonghen (Tottenham Hotspur)Midfielders: Yannick Carrasco (Dalian Yifang), Nacer Chadli (West Bromwich Albion), Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City), Mousa Dembélé (Tottenham Hotspur), Marouane Fellaini (Manchester United), Adnan Januzaj (Real Sociedad), Youri Tielemans (Monaco), Axel Witsel (Tianjin Quanjian)Forwards: Michy Batshuayi (Chelsea), Christian Benteke (Crystal Palace), Eden Hazard (Chelsea), Thorgan Hazard (Borussia Monchengladbach), Romelu Lukaku (Manchester United), Dries Mertens (Napoli)"

The Belgian is the obvious pick of the bunch from a squad packed with players who dazzled this season, which shows just how good he has been. City’s creator in chief was the only player to reach triple figures for chances created (106) and he has registered the most assist in Europe’s top leagues (16). Rating: 7.80Romelu Lukaku has led the line admirably for Manchester United this season, with a direct hand in at least one goal in two thirds (21) of his league appearances. The 25-year-old’s hold-up play was very good, yielding seven assists, and his workrate cannot be faulted. Rating: 7.29Even though he missed out on the Golden Boot, Harry Kane scored 30 league goals this season for the first time in his career. He showed some moments of brilliance, not only in the penalty box, but also with his vision and range of passing. Rating: 7.60Mohamed Salah ended his sensational debut season at Liverpool by winning the Golden Boot and setting a record for goals scored in a 38-game Premier League campaign. His return of 32 goals would have been unimaginable nine monghs ago. He also amassed 10 assists, ensuring he had a direct hand in a goal every 70 minutes – a remarkable level of consistency. Rating: 7.69Eden Hazard may have fallen short of last season’s figures but at his best he is still among the league’s elite. Indeed, no player won more of our man of the match awards and he only started 28 games. He also retained his status as the league’s best dribbler by a distance, completing 165. Rating: 7.69It’s difficult to pick out a star player from the Arsène Wenger’s swansong season. Nacho Monreal has seldom let his manager down in recent seasons and he has found an unlikely goalscoring knack, scoring five times this season, having failed to find the net in the league in four full seasons beforehand. Rating: 7.13The embodiment of Burnley’s surprising success, James Tarkowski, stepped up to replace Michael Keane this season and helped guide the club into the Europa League. The 25-year-old ranks among the top 10 players in the league for both clearances (7.1) and aerial duels won per game (4.7). His importance to the side was clear, with Burnley failing to win in the seven matches he missed. Rating: 7.22To say Everton didn’t really have any standout players would be an understatement. Idrissa Gueye was a solid performer amid all the averageness. The Senegalese midfielder again broke up play with impressive regularity; his average of 3.5 tackles per game was the second highest in the league. The 28-year-old may be hoping to impress potential suitors at the World Cup this summer. Rating: 6.95It was good to see Leicester’s star players back on form this season. Jamie Vardy had an impressive season once more, scoring 20 league goals, and much of that was down to Riyad Mahrez, who was one of only five players to reach double figures for both goals (12) and assists (10) – seven of the latter teed up Vardy, making theirs the most efficient combination in the league. Rating: 7.28Newcastle fans could not have asked for better than the top-half finish Rafa Benítez and his side secured, marshalled superbly by captain Jamaal Lascelles. The 24-year-old was a cool head at the back, always looking to play out from defence. He was strong in the air at both ends of the pitch, scoring three times and leading the way for Newcastle in both clearances and aerial duels won. Rating: 7.04Palace only finished outside of the top half of the table on goal difference, a remarkable feat given they began the season with seven straight defeats. It’s impossible to overstate the influence Wilfried Zaha had after coming back from injury. The forward missed 10 games in total and the Eagles lost all 10. He scored nine goals this season, the most prolific of his career. Only Eden Hazard completed more dribbles than Zaha and only Raheem Sterling won more penalties. Rating: 7.38Bournemouth’s two survival campaigns – both secured well ahead of time – have been down to the collective rather than one or two key players. Simon Francis, the team’s captain, embodied that team spirit and willingness to work. He split his time between centre-back and right-back, and was consistent in both positions, winning the most aerial duels for the club (4.4 per game). Rating: 6.96The Hammers’ record summer signing looked like a waste of money in the first few months of the season but he has been the undisputed star under David Moyes. Without his goals, the club would have been in real danger of the drop. His eventual tally of 11 goals – along with six assists – matches West Ham’s best from a single player since Bobby Zamora hit that figure way back in the 2006-07 season. Rating: 7.07His influence waned in the second half of the season as the club drifted towards safety, but Abdoulaye Doucouré was Watford’s star player. The midfielder was at the heart of every move, averaging well over 10 passes per game more than any of his team-mates. He won possession in the middle third more than any other player in the Premier League and had a direct hand in 10 goals. Rating: 7.00Brighton had some strong performers this season, but the centre-back pairing of Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy were pivotal to their success. Duffy tends to be overlooked but was the busier of the two, making the most clearances (8.8) and blocks per game (1.6) in the entire league and winning the most aerial duels of any centre-back. Rating: 7.18Another rock at the back for one of the three promoted survivors, Christopher Schindler enjoyed a very impressive debut season in the Premier League. The 28-year-old missed just one game, through suspension, and his proactive attitude was key to the team’s pressing style. The German made more tackles than any other centre-back in the league (2.2 per game). Rating: 7.11The campaign may have ended in relief and elation, but it was bitterly disappointing for Southampton, who dropped nine places from last season. Their most reliable player for the last two seasons, Oriol Romeu, was not always at his best, but he still led the way for the side in both tackles (2.7) and interceptions per game (2). Rating: 6.92One of few Swansea players who will be on the radar of Premier League clubs this summer following their relegation, Jordan Ayew can hold his head high with regards to never giving up the fight. The Ghanaian had a direct hand in at least three more goals than any of his team-mates (nine) and weighed in with a highly commendable 2.3 tackles per game – ranking second for the Swans from his attacking position. Rating: 6.91It will be interesting to see what the future holds for Kurt Zouma after what was, from an individual perspective, a worthwhile loan spell at Stoke. The 23-year-old secured solid figures for interceptions (1.8) and clearances per game (6.8) and will be keen to stay in the Premier League, be it with Chelsea or, more likely, on loan once more. Rating: 7.12Despite the unlikeliest of bids for a great escape under Darren Moore, the Baggies finished bottom of the pile and are likely to field many offers for players this summer. Craig Dawson may be an exception. He has been among the club’s most reliable performers for some time and should hope to find a new home in his favoured centre-back role. The defender is very strong in the air and would be an astute signing for a club looking to add some steel to their backline.

The overwhelming impression was of a man entirely comfortable in his own skin. Gareth Southgate spoke with logic and humour but, most of all, he left the unmistakable sense that England’s manager may know a bit more about this level of football than some people realise. “The only thing that bothers me is that everybody keeps asking me about the pressure,” he said. “That’s when I start to think: ‘Bloody hell, maybe I’m not seeing what it should be’. If I felt underprepared, if we were not ready and we’d spent the last 10 days flapping about who should be in, I would probably feel more anxious.”Instead, he and his staff have held a meeting every Monday to discuss his World Cup squad, the various back-up options and all the logistics of preparing for a major tournament. Small details, in many cases, right down to whether the players should avoid the “misery” of Twitter and inviting a psychologist to join them in Russia. Dr Pippa Grange, who will travel with the squad, has presumably been warned to expect some resistance from one or two players. To quote Jamie Vardy when Leicester City did something similar: “There’s no point putting a psychologist in front of me because he won’t get inside my head.”The players will meet on Sunday but, first things first, Southgate has given them permission to go on holiday this week with no rules attached. Was that a risk bearing in mind some of the headlines England’s footballers have attracted before other tournaments? “Before Euro 96 I had three days in Magaluf with Aston Villa,” Southgate explained, “so it would be a bit hypocritical for me to discuss what the correct preparation was. Everything in a footballer’s life these days is ‘fill this bloody form in’. There’s a danger we overfill them with professionalism and doing the right thing. They need a switch-off and I don’t see an issue. I’m not interested in what they do over the next few days.”Southgate kept his memories of Magaluf to himself but there was a giveaway smile. “I went for a run on a couple of mornings,” he said. “Though it might have been a run back home, rather than a ‘run’.”To put it another way, the England manager intends to take the unusual step of treating his players like adults. Again, it’s the small details, such as allowing them to leave England’s base camp in Repino to visit St Petersburg without feeling the need to call out a search party.Other managers would impose curfew times or restrict access to mobile phones. “I don’t like loads of rules,” Southgate countered. “The players are responsible enough, they know what’s expected. Sometimes, if they have their phones that means they spend time together, looking at videos and interacting. If they haven’t, they just rush back to their rooms.”In Fabio Capello’s days as manager, the Football Association issued an official code of conduct rationing the time players spent on video or computer games, as well as banning them from making comments on social media unless it was authorised. Quietly, that has been abolished under Southgate’s tenure. He will, however, warn his players that Twitter can be an instant mood-killer. “Personally I’m not sure there’s value to reading the comments that come in,” he said. “It comes back to what creates pressure, or what creates misery, in your life. Generally, there’s a lot of social media that can be negative, so why invite that into your life?”Southgate has not put a message on Twitter since April 2015 and seems perfectly happy to have made the break. “I can’t ban them [the players] from looking at it because who knows what they’re doing when they go to their room? But I would make the suggestion: ‘Is it a good idea to read all that [abuse]?’ If you can rationalise it, accept it and put it in its own place, then fine. But I don’t know too many people who can. Even if there are 50 good replies, you can’t help but think about the one bugger who gives you advice you don’t want to hear.”Nobody pointed out there was more just one dissenter after Southgate had named his squad earlier in the week. Yet the England manager did not show a flicker of self-doubt when it came to explaining his choices and, though he was tactful not to say anything that could be construed as overly critical, there were various clues when it came to the players who had been left out.All the great teams, he said, from Liverpool in the 1970s and 1980s, to Milan in the 1990s and the modern Manchester City, had “athleticism, energy and pace”. He wanted his team to press the opposition, he added, and hunt down the ball. Listening to this little speech, it felt clear why Jack Wilshere and Jonjo Shelvey were considered only briefly.The explanation for Shelvey’s omission concluded with a mention of checking the “character and personality” of all the players. Southgate reiterated his sympathies for Ryan Bertrand and insisted the door was still open for Joe Hart if the goalkeeper found a new club next season and returned to form. Not so much Chris Smalling, though, after being excluded because Southgate wanted England’s centre-halves to be better on the ball. “We made that decision in November and I’ve not seen any reason to change the thinking,” he said.For someone who was once considered too gentlemanly to make the really tough calls, Southgate has quietly taken a sledgehammer to a number of international careers. For that, there were no apologies, just the clear impression that he was happy with his choices and not willing to bend for anyone.“I was involved with Crystal Palace in 1990 [the FA Cup final] – Sir Alex Ferguson’s first trophy – when he took Jim Leighton out of the team and played Les Sealey in the replay. They were massive calls that I am sure he didn’t enjoy making but, if you think it is the right thing, you don’t do it for effect. You do it because it is the right thing and you have to make those calls.”"

As Jerusalem prepares for the inauguration of its new US embassy on Monday, the city’s best football team has announced it is renaming itself in honour of Donald Trump.In December, the US president defied global opposition by recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, angering Palestinians and Muslims around the world who see the ancient city as a capital of their future state.“For 70 years has Jerusalem been awaiting international recognition, until President Donald Trump, in a courageous move, recognised Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel,” read a statement on Beitar Jerusalem’s official Facebook page. “President Trump has shown courage, and true love of the Israeli people and their capital, and these days other countries are following his lead in giving Jerusalem its rightful status ... The chairmen of the club, the owner Eli Tabib and the executive manager Eli Ohana have decided to add to the club’s title the name of the American President who made history, and from now on will be called Beitar Trump Jerusalem.”It is not clear whether the name change is permanent. 70 שנה המתינה ירושלים להכרה בינלאומית, עד שהנשיא דונלד טראמפ החליט לעשות מעשה והכיר בה כבירת הנצח של עם ישראל.בית""ר ירושלים, מהמותגים הירושלמים הבולטים ביותר, החליט לגמול לנשיא על אהבתו, ומעתה תיקרא קבוצת המנורה ""בית""ר 'טראמפ' ירושלים"".לפרטים המלאים: https://t.co/F03lrPfsmO pic.twitter.com/pngl3dPUwiBeitar, who have won six Israel Premier League titles, are currently in second place in the table.It is unsurprising that the club has supported Trump’s divisive move. It is the only club in the Israeli Premier League never to have signed an Arab player and some sections of its fanbase have a reputation for racism. When the club signed two Chechen Muslims in 2013, the players were verbally abused and spat at by fans. The club’s offices were later set on fire by fans apparently angry at the Chechens’ arrival."

In need of a left-back and ready to plump for experience over youth, José Mourinho will look beyond Celtic’s Kieran Tierney and sign Alex Sandro from Juventus instead. A deal could be done following next Saturday’s FA Cup final and any such transaction looks likely to spell the end of Luke Shaw’s miserable stay at Old Trafford. Juve are prepared to let Sandro leave this summer, but will demand £55m for the 27-year-old, while Shaw is attracting interest from Tottenham Hotspur and Everton. Daley Blind and Matteo Darmian are also expected to leave United and their departures would help trim the club’s wage bill by the thick end of £10m.Napoli boss Maurizio Sarri has made no secret of the fact he’d quite like Antonio Conte’s job at Chelsea and speculation is already mounting that the two men might swap roles. Reports from Naples say the club’s deep-lying midfielder, Jorginho, reckons Sarri would take him to Chelsea, while Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur are also interested in making a Premier League player of the 26-year-old Italy international who is valued at just over £50m. Having issued what has been interpreted as an ultimatum to Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, a Tottenham splurge of such magnitude might constitute just what the doctor ordered for the Argentinian manager. Current Spurs midfielders Mousa Dembélé and Victor Wanyama could be sold to help fund a move for one of the most sought-after players in Europe. In other news pertaining to Napoli, Arsenal are giving the Serie A side’s burly Senegalese centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly the glad eye but will have to pay more than £50m for his services.Riyad Mahrez looks to have played his final game in a Leicester City shirt and is once again the subject of interest from Manchester City, having failed to secure a move to the Etihad on the final day of the January transfer window. City’s interest in Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha has also been well-documented, but upon being quizzed about his future yesterday, the 25-year-old said Palace “is my home and there’s no reason for me to leave”.Brazilian fun-boy Neymar continues to be mentioned in conjunction with a move away from Paris Saint-Germain to Manchester United or Real Madrid, but says he is “weary” of speculation regarding his future and wants to hear no more of it until after the World Cup. Barcelona remain hopeful of signing Atlético Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann without upsetting his employers by activating his £88m (€100m) release clause and are prepared to pay an additional £13.2m (€15m) on top of that sum to maintain good relations with the Madrid side. Barcelona have already agreed personal terms with the France international, who wants the move wrapped up before the World Cup. Leicester fans will be upset to learn that their unpopular manager, Claude Puel, plans to honour his contract despite receiving overtures from 1990s synth-popsters Saint Etienne, while their Huddersfield counterparts are collectively clinging to the lower legs of their boss David Wagner, in the hope it will prevent the German from abandoning them. In other managerial news, Everton and West Ham both want Marco Silva, who has been out of work since being sacked by Watford in January. "

It has been a financial, logistical and physical nightmare but The Fiver has finally completed its journey and all that remains is to fritter away 24 hours or so before kick-off in Saturday’s Big Cup final. The overland trek was gruelling, there have been outrageous bribes, costly misunderstandings and a particularly heated argument over the state of our accommodation, not to mention of our personal hygiene, but all that matters is that when the players of Liverpool and Real Madrid stride out on to the pitch in Kiev’s Olimpiyskiy Stadium, The Fiver will be roaring them on from our favourite stool at The Lengthy Barf. Occasions like these are not to be missed! And where else would we be?As more fragrant observers have noted, Saturday’s match-up is a repeat of 1981’s Big Cup final, although let’s hope that does not turn out to be the case because it wasn’t much of a spectacle, truth be told. In fact, these showpiece duels are often letdowns for the neutral Tin swiller. But there’s something in the air – perhaps a swirling shot by Him, or Loris Karius after colliding with Dejan Lovren – that suggests this one could be different and more akin to the thrillers of yore. Like when Real used to win these things 3-2, 4-3 or 7-3.Or, indeed, like when Real lost 5-3 to a Benfica side featuring Eusébio, Mário Coluna and James Milner. Only once since that 1962 extravaganza have we been treated to a final in which both teams have scored more than one goal. That, of course, was in 2005 when a canny display of first-half incompetence by Liverpool set the scene for Milan to be mowed down in the second half by a barrage of custard pies. Oh how onlookers laughed as yellow liquid dripped down Paolo Maldini’s incredulous face and Djinkin’ Djimi Traoré made off with a winner’s medal!You get the feeling that if anyone can make mugs out of this Real team, who’ve been dodging punchlines all season, then it is Jürgen Klopp’s gloriously wacky troupe.“His initials are LFC.

Mark Hughes has been rewarded for keeping Southampton in the Premier League with a three-year deal.The former Wales, Manchester City and Stoke manager was charged with keeping the Saints in the top flight when he took over in March in place of Mauricio Pellegrino. Having achieved that, he is now contracted to stay at St Mary’s - along with his assistants, Mark Bowen and Eddie Niedzwiecki - until the summer of 2021.“Mark, Eddie and I are thrilled to have signed long-term contracts with the club. It was the only option we considered, having spent the last eight weeks with the club,” Hughes said.“Now it is vital that we take the unbelievable support we received from the fans during the last few games into next season. The staff and the players will work hard every day to deliver the success this club deserves and, with everyone pulling together, we will achieve our goals.”Southampton were a point above the drop zone when the 54-year-old, sacked by Stoke earlier in the new ywar, replaced Pellegrino.Hughes won three of his 10 games in charge, the most crucial being a 1-0 victory at Swansea in the penultimate game of the season which to all intents secured survival at the expense of their opponents.Hughes made 61 appearances for Southampton during an illustrious playing career that also took in Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Manchester United and Chelsea.As a manager he impressed in his first role in charge of Wales, before moving on to make a positive impression at Blackburn.From there he went to Manchester City, Fulham and QPR before spending four and a half years at Stoke.“Mark and his team had a massive impact from the first day on the players, staff and fans alike, and was able to pull together everyone involved with the club to deliver the results needed,” a Southampton statement said.“It is important now, under Mark’s leadership, for everyone to move into the new season with a renewed focus and energy alongside the continued and valuable support of our fans.”"

Nothing, perhaps, should give Liverpool such heart ahead of Saturday’s Champions League final as Bayern Munich’s first goal against Real Madrid in the second leg of their semi-final.Nothing dramatic happens. Franck Ribéry turns in from the left flank and plays an unremarkable low pass in to Robert Lewandowski in a central position on the edge of the box. The ball bounces up in front of the Polish striker and his first touch as a result takes him away from goal. He is able, though, to shield the ball and, as Sergio Ramos decides to sit off, Lewandowski has time to work the ball wide to Thomas Müller who is, bafflingly, in 15 yards of space, out on the touchline, roughly level with the edge of the box.Marcelo, the Madrid left-back, has been drawn into the centre, tucking in as though anticipating that Lewandowski might allow Ribéry’s pass to run across his body and then turn Ramos. That much is reasonable. What is not is what then happens. Marcelo must have been aware of Müller’s presence. Müller is, after all, his primary concern. As soon as Lewandowski’s touch took him away from goal and Ramos didn’t lunge in (and nobody can blame Marcelo for thinking that he might), Marcelo should have been closing down the space. Instead, he dropped back, five yards behind the defensive line, and only then moved left to shut Müller down.By then it was probably too late, although Marcelo dawdled, hanging back in a no man’s land when a sprint might still have pressured the cross. Ramos, slightly half-heartedly, did cut out the cross at the near post, but his indecision knocked the ball down for Joshua Kimmich, who scored.Marcelo is perhaps the finest attacking left-back in the world. That deal that took him from Fluminense to Madrid in 2007 for around £5m may, pound for pound, be the greatest the club has completed. In the majority of the games they play, Marcelo is perfect for Madrid. He works up and down the line. He is quick. His touch is superb. He can cross. He scores a couple of goals a season. The only problem comes when he has to defend. Most of the time he doesn’t have to, but he surely will in Kiev.If Mohamed Salah is gifted the sort of space on Saturday that Müller was in that second leg, and if he produces anything like the sort of form he was showing a month ago, Liverpool will devastate Madrid on that flank. Normally, that would be enough to give them a clear edge, but this is anything but a normal game. None of the usual rules seem to apply.Nothing Trent Alexander-Arnold did in Rome was quite as eye-catching as Marcelo’s dilatoriness for that first Bayern goal, but equally the way Stephan El Shaarawy exposed him in the second leg will have not have gone unnoticed by Madrid. In part, of course, that’s because Salah was exempted from defensive duties that night, seemingly instructed to remain high up the pitch and occupy the space behind Aleksandar Kolarov so that every time Liverpool regained possession there was an obvious and dangerous out-ball.Whether Madrid play a 4-3-3 or, more likely, a 4-3-1-2 with Isco tucked behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, Alexander-Arnold will surely be targeted. The question for Jürgen Klopp is then whether to have Salah drop back and help out defensively, or to call Madrid’s bluff and risk them doubling up on the full-back for the potential reward of Salah constantly in space high up the pitch behind Marcelo.In most games it would be enough to say the battle on that flank would be decisive. But here it feels inadequate. Dani Carvajal did return, after a month’s absence, to play the full 90 minutes against Villarreal on the final day of the league season, which means he, rather than the converted winger Lucas Vázquez, will play at right-back. But if there is any doubt about his fitness it will be sorely tested by the pace of Sadio Mané, particularly if Andy Robertson can get up to support him – which he should be able to do if Madrid play a 4-3-1-2 and focus on trying to expose Alexander-Arnold on the other flank.And then there’s the question of the centre. Ramos is a fine defender in one-on-one situations, but how will he and Raphaël Varane cope with Roberto Firmino dropping deep, leaving them with space to mark until Salah and Mané dart into it?A repeated problem for Liverpool under Klopp has been the lack of protection afforded their back four when they lose compactness and space opens up in front of it. The nature of their pressing game means there is no natural holding player to sit in. That is a major concern and one that Isco, tucked behind two forwards, could be ideally placed to exploit.Everywhere on the pitch, it seems, on both sides, there are defensive flaws that might be exploited. And that’s what makes this final so hard to read. It’s not just that either side could win, it’s that either side could win by a wide margin."

The Football Association has defended the England forward Raheem Sterling over a tattoo of a gun on his right leg, praising his “honest and heartfelt” explanation for the choice after he faced severe criticism in the tabloid press.Sterling had posted a picture of himself on Instagram training with his England team-mates at St George’s Park, with a tattoo of an M16 assault rifle visible on his right calf. The Sun put the image on its front page on Tuesday, with the headline: “Raheem shoots himself in the foot”.Lucy Cope, who founded Mothers Against Guns after her son Damian was shot dead outside a club in central London in 2002, told the newspaper the tattoo was “totally unacceptable”. When you’re training and realised you ain’t post on the gram in couple days.📸A post shared by  Raheem Sterling x 😇 (@sterling7) on May 27, 2018 at 2:41pm PDT“We demand he has the tattoo lasered off or covered up with a different tattoo,” she said. “If he refuses he should be dropped from the England team. He’s supposed to be a role model but chooses to glamorise guns.”But Sterling explained the tattoo’s significance in his Instagram post. “When I was two my father died from being gunned down to death,” the 23-year-old said. “I made a promise to myself I would never touch a gun in my life time, I shoot with my right foot so it has a deeper meaning.”He said the tattoo had not yet been finished.On Tuesday afternoon the FA backed Sterling. “We all support Raheem Sterling and acknowledge the honest and heartfelt account he gave via Instagram last night,” a spokesperson said. “He and the rest of the squad are focused solely on preparing for the forthcoming World Cup.”Some have questioned the motives behind the criticism, which follows numerous negative stories about the player over the years.[Thread] a selection of times when our national press have chosen to run stories on Raheem Sterling. 1. The one where Raheem was 'tired'. pic.twitter.com/6K3cHu6r7TIn 2015, the Daily Mirror accused him of being “greedy” in pay negotiations. He has also been criticised for taking nitrous oxide. In 2016 The Sun ran a story headlined “Obscene Raheem” accusing him of enraging fans by showing off his “blinging” house on social media. Sterling later said that he had bought the house for his mother, who raised him and his two sisters alone after the death of his father.The poet and columnist Musa Okwonga said the Sun and the Daily Mail “seem to take it almost in turns to go after Raheem Sterling, apparently for no reason other than he is black and successful”.In a thread on Twitter, Okwonga said Sterling received a “routine hounding” from the newspapers. Former England player Gary Lineker described his treatment as “disgusting” and said that attempts to “destroy our players” ahead of major tournaments were uniquely British and “weird, unpatriotic and sad”.Others suggested class could be a factor, with Adam Payne, political reporter at Business Insider UK, saying that Wayne Rooney had received similar treatment.Raheem Sterling's treatment shows classism if alive and well in British football. Working-class kid dares to reach beyond his station, held to bizarre standards/double standards. ""Prem rat.. footie idiot."" Same happened with Rooney. Probably some underlying racism with Sterling."

Shortly after the final whistle Yeovil Town’s manager stood in the middle of a suddenly near deserted pitch and positively glowed with pride in his club. As Jamie Sherwood outlined the reasons for optimism about the future, a hazy north-east sun suddenly seemed a little brighter.A couple of minutes earlier and a few yards away Melanie Copeland, Sherwood’s Sunderland counterpart, had also stopped to reflect. She, too, was rightly proud of her team but spoke of “uncertainty,” about things “being up in the air”. There were potential “disappointments” and “clouds” blemishing the horizon.Considering Yeovil had just finished bottom of the Women’s Super League first division table, ending a season in which they have scored only two goals and collected just two points with yet another defeat and Sunderland had risen to seventh, something did not quite add up.This puzzling equation can be balanced by learning that Yeovil have already convinced the Football Association to grant them a place in WSL1 next season, when an expanded, revamped top tier turns fully professional, but Sunderland’s future remains unclear.While Yeovil are entirely self-sustaining – unusually they receive no financial help from the men’s team they share a name with – Sunderland have suffered horribly from their parent club’s decision last summer in effect to start divorce proceedings against them.Copeland’s squad suddenly found themselves both excluded from Sunderland AFC’s magnificently appointed Academy of Light training ground and relocated from their previous County Durham base to play at Mariners Park, the home of non-league South Shields. Practice sessions took place at facilities shared with Northumbria University in Newcastle and sometimes involved sub-standard, dangerously icy pitches.Sunderland AFC declined to support their application for WSL1 membership in the first round of bidding for places in the revamped league but four positions in the proposed new 14-team division remain open, with the identity of the successful bids scheduled to be announced by the FA next Sunday.After joining forces with Northumbria University and deciding against a complete name change, Sunderland have applied to stay in WSL1 but could yet end up as one of five clubs granted slots in WSL2. Alternatively they could be demoted two divisions.Considering Sunderland produced a nucleus of the current England team – Lucy Bronze, Steph Houghton, Jill Scott, Jordan Nobbs, Demi Stokes, Carly Telford and Beth Mead all began their careers with them – the current uncertainty is the cause of considerable anger and upset.Copeland and her players face a nervous week waiting for Sunday’s announcement and no one is happy. “It’s up in the air,” said Copeland, a cousin of Alan Shearer. “I don’t know what’s happening.” Sherwood is suitably shocked. “It’s a terrible shame,” he said. “Sunderland has been such an important part of the women’s game and produced so many England players.”Behind his delight at a crowd-funding initiative helping raise sufficient cash to ensure Yeovil can turn from part-time to fully professional next season, he too harbours a few potential reservations over the FA’s WSL rebrand.Apart from the obvious concerns about his club’s ability to compete more equally with highly resourced Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal and their glittering array of leading internationals, this was Sherwood’s last game as manager.FA rules dictate that a 39-year-old who will become Yeovil’s football director is no longer permitted to juggle his day job – a full-time teaching post at a Cardiff college – with coaching. Several players may also depart, with some offloaded and others opting for the security of longer-term careers before a high-risk, quite possibly, lower-paid football odyssey.“It’s very sad about Jamie,” said Nigel House, surely Yeovil’s most loyal supporter and one of a small handful who had made the trek north. “But there’s been 80 applicants for his job.”Sherwood broke the nine-hour bus trip north with a rare overnight stay on Saturday. On learning House was embarking on the 760-mile round trip from his Weymouth home he invited him to dinner in the team hotel.Afterwards House, who never misses a game, was presented with a commemorative shirt signed by every player. “Nigel epitomises everything this club’s about,” said Sherwood. “He’s a special person.”House could not stop smiling after Annie Heatherson scored Yeovil’s second goal of the season here. Although Keira Ramshaw subsequently headed an equaliser following a cross from the impressive Mollie Lambert and Bridget Galloway subsequently volleyed a superb Sunderland winner, the visitors always competed, with the goalkeeper, Megan Walsh, excelling.Technical proficiency was presumably higher as Manchester City beat Everton 3-0 to finish second behind Chelsea and beat Arsenal to the WSL’s remaining Champions League place but there was nowhere House would have rather been. There is no chance of his switching allegiance to the newly formed Manchester United side hoping to join WSL2 under the management of the former England defender and current assistant coach, Casey Stoney.“This club’s like a family,” said a beaming House. “And I’ve never seen a side like Yeovil. These girls never, ever give up fighting. They’ve always got each other’s backs. They’re a real team.”"

Sam Allardyce has said he expects to discover next week whether Farhad Moshiri wants to retain him as Everton manager, a fortnight after claiming the club’s major shareholder had given clarity over his future.Allardyce will have an end-of-season debrief with Moshiri in the wake of Sunday’s game at West Ham, although no date has been set, with his position one of several pressing issues the billionaire needs to resolve this summer. A new director of football is expected, with PSV Eindhoven’s Marcel Brands lined up, a new chief executive is required, as is progress on the new stadium, and Wayne Rooney is seeking clarification on the club’s direction, with uncertainty rife under Moshiri’s leadership.Allardyce met Moshiri two weeks ago having called for clarity about the job amid widespread disenchantment among supporters. Moshiri did not offer public backing afterwards but the former England manager insisted he was satisfied with the outcome and the pair had discussed plans for next season.On Friday, however, Allardyce admitted his future remains in doubt because Moshiri’s intentions are unclear. “I would have thought there will be some meeting somewhere along the line next week,” said the manager, who has a season remaining on his contract. “I would think it will be with Farhad. It depends on what part of the world he’s in. He’s a busy man, running companies worth billions and billions of pounds. His schedule is far greater than mine so I’ll drop into his schedule whenever I possibly can and meet him where I can, if that is what he wishes.“He has got things to sort out. We all have things to sort out. At the moment for me it is speculation and I will find out what Farhad is thinking when I see him. I can’t speculate or predict what Farhad is thinking or isn’t thinking. I’ve done all I can do, that’s what I’ll say to him – I can’t do any more than that. Right now the players will be speculating, as will the staff, as will everybody. Speculation is one of the worst things to happen in a football club results-wise because when it starts – and there’s a lot of speculation about me, about players and about everything else – it’s difficult.”Allardyce confirmed that negotiations had taken place over a move to DC United for Rooney, who has not asked to leave and would prefer to stay at his boyhood club next season. Rooney, however, is looking for assurances over any future role at Everton and an answer on whether the club are prepared to activate the extra 12-month option on his contract. That answer was not forthcoming from Allardyce.“I can’t answer that at the moment,” he said. “Until I sit down and discuss everything about the football club next week then it’s speculative and I can’t discuss that.”Rooney missed training on Friday with a knee injury – after Allardyce had said he was fit – and will not feature at West Ham."

Sergio Ramos was born with golden balls. That’s what Sergio Ramos says, anyway – and, he adds, they’re right where they’re supposed to be. It’s no Ossie’s Dream and it’s not the Anfield Rap either, but this week Real Madrid’s captain released a cup final song of his own: a European Cup final song, offered up with the words “my house, some friends, a lot of magic and this is the result: my life in a song and lots of verses still to write”. With the usual rapper’s brag and bravado, SR4 tells his journey from the streets – well, the square in Camas, Seville – to the World Cup and close to another Champions League title. Already “a legend,” as the track has it, it would be his fourth.Nothing was handed over free, runs one line; “his ‘testiculine’ is not for sale, it comes out as a Panenka” – that moment when, in the Euro 2012 semi-final, he dinked in a penalty. That was one of a handful of moments that define a player with a gift for the epic and the grand gesture, for goals too, late ones, important ones, who is almost a cartoon character at times. It was also two months since the European Cup semi-final when, during the shootout, he sent the ball sailing over and some, including Manuel Neuer, into fits of laughter. That night Ramos vowed he would show them. So he did.When he missed the penalty against Bayern Munich, it denied Madrid a shot at their 10th European Cup. They had waited a decade and it had become an obsession. Two years later they reached the final against Atlético, but it was slipping away; they were “on a tightrope”, as the track has it. The clock showed 92.48 – a number that makes up one of the dozens of his tattoos, the latest added a few days ago – when Ramos headed an equaliser and Madrid went on to win.Ramos was, by his own admission, close to joining Manchester United in summer 2015. He had been at Madrid for 10 years, was attracted to something new and the relationship with the president was strained. No one represents Madrid quite like him and not only had he scored that goal to finally win the 10th European Cup, he had also scored twice in Munich in the 2014 semi-final. But, as the possibility of a move became clear, some powerful voices turned on him and he asked to go.Madrid would not let it happen. When Ramos and Florentino Pérez emerged from a tense meeting in China that went on for hours, just the two of them alone, accusations made, the decision had been taken: he was staying. It has worked out rather well.Despite a decade at the club, there was some concern over the fans’ response, which was one of the reasons there had never been a public rebellion. But he overcame that and fast. Ramos was made club captain and by the end of the season he was lifting the European Cup, having scored the opening goal in the final against Atlético. A year after, he lifted it again. Saturday may be the third time. Add 2014 and it is four finals in five years.In SR4 there’s a line that runs: “MVP of the Champions League, another big-ears for Chamartín.” At the end of this month’s semi against Bayern, Ramos, who had spent the previous hour throwing himself in front of everyone and everything, went to fans at the south end, climbed in among them, took the mic and sang. “Kings of Europe! We’re kings of Europe!” There was also a rendition of “How could I not love you, if you won the European Cup a 12th time?”Oh, they love him, all right. How could they not? The outrageous outfits, the occasional daftness, far more tongue-in-cheek than some realise, the dark arts, do not change that; they only deepen the admiration. He joined them at 19 and is 32, the only current player who had Zinedine Zidane as a team-mate.There may be doubts at times but when the big moments arise he is always there and they may never have had a leader like him; no one has led them through an era like this. “He symbolises the values of Madrid,” Zidane says.“It all started with you,” one line of the rap runs; with him wearing the armband seasons have a familiar ending. There is a basic and pretty stunning fact: as captain of Real Madrid, Ramos has never not won the trophy that defines the biggest club of all.No one has lifted this trophy three times at Madrid. Only Paco Gento captained Madrid three times in a final and he lost two, in 1962 and 1964. Miguel Muñoz was twice a European Cup-winning captain; as was Manolo Sanchís, in 1998 and 2000. No one has played more Madrid games than Raúl or Casillas: Raúl never lifted it and Casillas won it once, in 2014. The player with the fourth-most appearances, Santillana, was captain when they lost the 1981 final to Liverpool; in fifth, Fernando Hierro has won it as captain once. Ramos is set to overtake them all.Nor is it just going up to collect this cup. It is no coincidence this has happened under Ramos. He is a captain in the most cliched sense: direct, firm, open, driven to lead the collective. By his own admission the pressure at Madrid is special, where “every ‘lesson’ here is three elsewhere”.He says: “I have been here a long time, I know what it means to have this badge on your chest.” But perhaps that is the way he likes it, just as he embraced the switch to centre-back, because of the “hierarchy”, the “status”, the responsibility. The armband was an adornment that reinforced his character: “I was like that anyway.”“Some players need guidance,” Ramos says. “We all have a role and as captain, having been here for so many years, it’s your job to give [young players] support and confidence; I feel proud to have played that role,” he told Spanish radio this week.When it was put to him that he had also sorted out the dressing room, the answer was striking. “We’ve never lacked quality, galácticos, great players,” he said, “but maybe we have [lacked] what you’re talking about. [Overcoming] the individual egos of players who were good people but maybe rowed in their own, different direction. You have to convince them that if the team wins collectively, then they all win individually.”“The key to this team is the commitment of the leaders, Ramos and Ronaldo,” says Sanchís, himself the son of a European Cup winner with Madrid. “Ramos is the standard-bearer of this generation.”Only two players played more games for Madrid than Sanchís junior. No one at Madrid has lifted the European Cup more times. Until now, perhaps. “Sergio says he is taking the record off me and I’m delighted,” Sanchís says."

Trent Alexander-Arnold has said it would be an honour to face Cristiano Ronaldo in the Champions League final having grown up watching him on YouTube but he says he is not overawed by the challenge against Real Madrid.Stopping Ronaldo and Madrid’s formidable attack on 26 May will be the final task of a highly impressive season with Liverpool for the right-back, who is also in Gareth Southgate’s thoughts for England’s World Cup squad.The 19-year-old, named Liverpool’s young player of the year at the club’s awards ceremony last week, admits the five‑times Champions League winner and the competition’s leading goalscorer will pose the biggest test of his career in Kiev. But he insists Ronaldo will not be Liverpool’s sole focus.“Real Madrid are a very strong team,” Alexander-Arnold said. “No matter who you’re going to play against it’s going to be one of the best players in the world because that’s the nature of the team they have. With Ronaldo being one of the greats, probably one of the best players ever, it’s going to be an honour to hopefully play against him. I’m looking forward to it.“I want to challenge myself and test myself against the best players in the world and there’s not many people better than Ronaldo. It will be a huge test for everyone and hopefully we come out on top.”Alexander-Arnold idolised Steven Gerrard as a young Liverpool fan while also admiring Lionel Messi and Ronaldo. “Not when he was playing for Man United, though,” he said of the Portugal international.“You have to admit he’s an unbelievable player and he’s done exceptional things in the game. The numbers that he does season in, season out are absolutely unbelievable.“I know a lot about him and the likes of Messi because I watched them on YouTube growing up. You always watch those type of players. But you’ve just got to focus on the game and, if he’s a direct opponent, you have to see what the strengths and weaknesses are and use them to your advantage. Come May 26, we’ll be looking to stop him and the rest of Real Madrid.”Alexander-Arnold has made 32 appearances for Jürgen Klopp’s team this season and finished the last of them, against Brighton on Sunday, by inviting a young Liverpool fan, Louis Henry, on the club’s lap of honour. The eight‑year‑old has cerebral palsy and was pushed around Anfield in his wheelchair by Alexander‑Arnold, whose mother delivered match tickets and players’ lounge passes to the Henry family the night before the game.The right-back will become the youngest player to appear in a European Cup final for Liverpool if he is selected in Kiev."

Fittingly Unai Emery’s overture as Arsenal’s head coach was high tempo and demanding. A whirlwind first day began on a transatlantic flight and flipped straight from the red eye into a burst of meeting, greeting and looking the part in the newly fitted club suit. For the Spaniard first impressions played a big part in his successful audition for the job and he set about making new ones as he introduced himself. The energy he likes to transmit was on show.Upstairs in the directors’ box lounge at the Emirates Stadium he tried to expand on what makes him tick. It was evident that the way he will communicate with his players is full on. From the way he spoke – making a determined effort to explain himself in English in his clear, booming voice – to the way he amplified his points with expressive gestures, his eyes darting briskly around the room to try not to miss anything, Emery will be an altogether different kind of presence around the squad. Arsène Wenger tended to be more cerebral, more observant, more about guiding someone than pushing him.Emery’s brand of charisma comes across as animated, spirited and direct.“I think the most important thing is to connect with people and have those personal relationships,” Emery said. “Heart to heart, head to head. The heart transmits emotion, the head transmits the intelligence. So it’s really important to have that connection both on a personal and collective level. What you are looking for is a shared experience. It’s true that you get the famous egos in football but that is true of top players and players who are not so good. I’m a coach that has come from second division, gone through to the first division, coached at PSG and now at Arsenal. And really the essence of it all is people.”Emery has begun to study the personalities he will begin to work with over the summer. Arsenal are not overly represented at the World Cup, so he will soon be trying to make those connections with a large proportion of the squad, the vehicle through which he will introduce his philosophy. While paying due respect to the “love for possession” he saw as part of the club’s heritage, he also stresses how his football ideal is also about intensity and pressing.That is another departure from Wenger’s focus on expression with the ball and it will be interesting to see how quickly Emery can effect a stylistic transformation. “I like to win the ball back as quickly as possible,” he said. “It’s about two things: possession and pressing.“Football is a demanding and difficult sport. What we want to do is not fear any team, either here in the Premier League or in Europe, and our objective is to be among the best and to beat the best. I’m the type of coach who has always worked really hard – not because I do it better than anyone else but because that is what I believe the most important thing is.” He talked about “that desire to be better” like a kind of compulsion, adding: “I’ve never seen anything handed out for free in football.”The 46-year-old looked effortlessly relaxed and confident in himself. He had that air of being comfortable in his own skin that comes with having the balance of experience and motivation to feel sure he can do this job well. When Wenger started at Arsenal (at the same age Emery is now) he described himself as “full of hope, full of belief as well” and Emery emits the same vibes.For all the revolution that began when Arsenal last appointed a new manager 22 years ago, a rarity in bringing a foreign manager into the English game, this announcement was a snapshot of how the football landscape has changed. It was an entirely international affair. In London Arsenal were introduced to a man from the Basque country who had been interviewed by a panel of football executives from South Africa, Germany and Spain, having impressed an American owner, to be shown around a stadium named after a Middle Eastern airline on the day the club unveiled record-breaking shirt sleeve sponsors from Rwanda.Emery took it all in his steady stride. He had been in contact with the Arsenal hierarchy while in charge of Paris Saint-Germain, attending the first interview two days after the French Cup final and with two Ligue 1 games remaining (nothing untoward as his departure from the Parc des Princes had been sealed and made public). The three big meetings he had with Arsenal went from strength to strength, making him the unanimous choice. His blend of personality and pedigree, and a willingness to work collaboratively with the head honchos, shone through. Emery has a load more meetings in the diary for the rest of this week where backroom staff and aims for the transfer window are on the agenda.For all Ivan Gazidis’s talk of a new structure with shared responsibility Emery undoubtedly carries the status of Arsenal’s new figurehead. Out with hashtag MerciArsène and in with WelcomeUnai. There were sudden changes made around the place, making sure the lifesize cutout of Wenger that had been in the tunnel was taken down in time for this unveiling and Emery’s brushed steel nameplate erected outside the head coach’s office. Over to the new man in town to show what he is made of."

Kevin De Bruyne believes Manchester City’s feat in reaching 100 points may be impossible to repeat, though he says this should be the challenge for Pep Guardiola’s side next season.Gabriel Jesus’s stoppage-time winner against Southampton at St Mary’s on Sunday enabled the Premier League champions to become the first club to reach that mark in England’s top division.“We all knew if we get 100 points it would be something so special and it is probably very difficult to manage again,” De Bruyne said.“It was the only thing to play for and, if you end the season that way, last minute, last kick of the season, and you get 100 points, it feels unbelievable.“In the end we broke the record – 100 points is something special. Three digits is very difficult to manage again and to be part of that means a lot.”Arsenal won the 2003-04 title unbeaten but with 90 points. Asked to compare City with that Arsène Wenger side, De Bruyne said: “We have the most points ever and with the competition you have with all the big teams it is very tough and to get 100 points and lose only 14 in the whole season is something special.”Guardiola has spoken of the need to try to retain the title next season, which only Manchester United and Chelsea have done in the Premier League era. De Bruyne echoed this.“You all start from nil again and to do the same [100 points] is probably impossible but we have to try,” the Belgian said.De Bruyne’s pass for Jesus’s goal on Sunday meant he claimed the inaugural Premier League award for the season’s most assists – 16 – one more than his City team-mate, Leroy Sané.Speaking during City’s open-top bus parade through Deansgate on Monday, Guardiola added: “Now is the time to enjoy what we’ve done this season. This summer we’ll watch the World Cup on the sofa - we’ll have some good beer, good red wine. Then we’ll try to come back stronger than this season.”"

Gareth Southgate may lack tournament experience as manager of a national team though it is already clear he prefers to remove doubt and uncertainty in favour of getting things done. Name the squad early, announce the captain shortly afterwards, and everyone knows where they stand.That makes it sound as if the identity of England’s captain in Russia is something people have been itching to know for weeks, when in reality the honour just bestowed on Harry Kane is simply a formality that needed to be addressed so it could be moved out of the way. Obviously it is an honour to captain one’s country at a World Cup, though the real privilege, the immortality shot, is to be captain of the country that wins the World Cup. Then you get to raise the trophy in front of thousands of ecstatic fans, to be chaired around the perimeter of the pitch by your tired-but-happy team-mates, to do all the things, in short, that the mind’s eye still sees Bobby Moore doing in 1966.Of course England have not won the World Cup since 1966, and have spent the last few tournaments going backwards, so posterity does not necessarily come along with the captain’s armband. Far from it, in fact. Kane’s predecessor as England World Cup captain, Steven Gerrard, was the choice of Fabio Capello and Roy Hodgson at the 2010 and 2014 tournaments respectively, though neither involved clouds of glory or an ending from the pages of schoolboy fiction.In Brazil four years ago, England lasted two competitive matches; Gerrard and his team were out before the group stage had been completed. We can only hope Southgate’s earnestly low-key approach can take England a little further in Russia, though it is plain that a manager’s choice of captain has little bearing on the success or otherwise of the team in the tournament.Football, it is traditional to say in these biennial contemplations, is not like cricket. There is very little on-field cleverness that a captain can bring to bear to influence the result of a game. If the tactics are wrong or the opponents are exploiting a weakness it is the manager on the sideline who has the responsibility to make necessary changes. All a captain can do in adverse circumstances is to try to adhere to instructions and keep a positive frame of mind, which is the least that should be expected of any player anyway.Southgate clearly believes Kane can lead by example, though the manager’s admiration for the player extends to his professional approach off the pitch as much as on it. Kane takes his football career seriously – “meticulous” was Southgate’s word to describe the player’s high standards of preparation and dedication – and as the leading English goalscorer of his generation with Tottenham and England, he is clearly someone the rest of the squad can look up to.On the pitch, however, Kane’s main concern and most vital contribution will be in attempting to score goals. Model professional he might be but Kane is in the squad principally for his goalscoring and once the matches start that will be what Southgate and everyone else will be hoping he delivers.In a sense, Kane’s goalscoring prowess is exactly what makes him a good choice of captain. He is always going to be in the starting lineup, and that is an important consideration. Kane is the spearhead of the England team on merit, and for the last couple of seasons he has been in exceptional form.In the past there have been situations when an England manager’s loyalty to a captain has guaranteed him a place in the side that could no longer be justified on form – David Beckham was indulged a little too long and Alan Shearer practically found it necessary to retire from international football to prevent Kevin Keegan picking him – but Kane, at the moment, appears a perfectly reasonable choice. All he has to do now is put the honour of captaincy to the back of his mind and concentrate on his natural game.While Kane may have latent leadership qualities and undiscovered tactical appreciation, his goals are what brought him to the forefront of the nation’s attention. A few more over the next month or so would be greatly appreciated."

The sculptural humiliation of football’s finest players continues apace. Few thought the bar could be lowered after one artist’s interpretation of Cristiano Ronaldo last year prompted much amusement on social media – but a strong contender has emerged in California.On Monday one of America’s finest ever footballers, Brandi Chastain, was inducted into the Bay Area Hall of Fame. The plaque in her honor has … provoked debate.Chastain, who won two World Cups with the US, diplomatically said the plaque was “nice” but admitted: “It’s not the most flattering.” The plaque captures Chastain with the pained expression of someone looking at a really bad plaque of Brandi Chastain.Ann Killion, the journalist who wrote the dedication on the plaque, was less diplomatic that Chastain. “Brandi Chastain is one of the most beautiful athletes I’ve ever covered,” Killion wrote on Twitter. “How this became her plaque is a freaking embarrassment.”After reaching a high point 2,500 years ago in ancient Greece, sporting sculpture has suffered of late. The bust of Ronaldo was subject to ridicule, and a statue of Michael Jackson – not known for his support of west London football – caused widespread bemusement when it was unveiled outside Fulham’s Craven Cottage in 2011.It is not just sculptors who have struggled to capture athletes’ likenesses. In 2015, a court artist managed to make famously handsome NFL star Tom Brady look like Gollum during his appearance in a Manhattan court.“He’s a very handsome guy,” the artist Jane Rosenberg said at the time. “It’s very hard in a very short time to get somebody so good-looking to look as good as they look [in person]. There’s no characteristic that really stands out. He doesn’t have a big nose, he doesn’t have bushy eyebrows or a beard. He’s just all perfect – perfect angles, nice blue eyes.”Tom Brady's courtroom sketch perfectly captures the, um, well... pic.twitter.com/04KyTfdCxDThe Bay Area Hall of Fame is reportedly considering making a new version of Chastain’s plaque.

Mauricio Pochettino sat down beside himself, draped his right arm across his shoulders and looked smilingly into the camera as Spurs staged another shoot to mark the signing of a big new contract. Then the manager ordered the club to get down to more business. And so, Spurs are preparing lucrative offers for Kayla the Eagle, the Crystals cheerleading ensemble and a bust of Roy Hodgson, all in an effort to make Wilfried Zaha feel at home at the new White Hart Lane. Then all Spurs will have to do is convince Crystal Palace to sell their prize asset, so we could be about to find out whether Daniel Levy likes being hardballed. The Spurs chairman is already wincing in anticipation, with £100m having been mentioned as a possible fee for Zaha.But Levy has promised Pochettino he will do his utmost to land the manager’s transfer targets so he might just have to grin and bear it. He does, at least, have alternatives: if Palace won’t cough up Zaha, Spurs will turn their attentions to Anthony Martial, whom Manchester United rated about as highly as they rated Zaha in the end. Spurs also have some leverage from the fact that United want to sign Toby Alderweireld. But there are doubts as to whether Martial wants to go to Palace, especially with Juventus also in the frame. And why are Juventus in the frame? Because they need a replacement for Douglas Costa, who excelled on loan from Bayern Munich last season but is not expected to return to Turin despite a purchase option because he is about to become the subject of a £75m transfer to … Manchester United. Circles within circles.But Pochettino doesn’t want to hear excuses. He has no truck whatsoever with people who promise big but then flop just short of the finish. No siree. So once Zaha and/or Martial are in the bag, he wants Spurs to lure Ryan Sessegnon from Fulham and the centre-back Matthijs de Ligt from Ajax. And he’s half-thinking about making a late attempt to attract Emre Can, even though the Liverpool midfielder has been fluttering eyelids at Juventus for months.Liverpool, meanwhile, are poised not only to strength their armoury by bringing Nabil Fekir from Lyon but are also plotting a swoop for the German striker Timo Werner. You heard it here 43rd. “The World Cup is not about auditioning for Barcelona, Madrid, Liverpool or whoever,” stormed the striker to Socrates magazine and he is of course quite right: Liverpool hope to have the deal done before the World Cup.Another striker potentially on the move is Samuel Eto’o. You thought he’d already retired, didn’t you? But the 37-year-old played in Turkey last season and still looks sharp enough to have aroused the interest of Lazio. The Italian club might also be interested in Frank Lampard if the ex-midfielder were not on the brink of becoming the new manager of Derby County. Finally, Arsenal are after the Roma midfielder Lorenzo Pellegrini."

For Coventry City there is finally scope for blue-sky thinking after sealing an immediate return to League One with a convincing play-off final win against Exeter City. For more than 37,000 baying Coventry supporters who made Wembley appear lopsided, the victory not only reversed an alarming slide but brought a first promotion for 51 years in arguably their biggest game since the 1987 FA Cup final.Fine second-half goals by Jordan Willis, Jordan Shipley and Jack Grimmer were enough for Coventry’s unpopular owner, Joy Seppala, the chief executive of the hedge fund Sisu, to nudge her sunglasses on to her forehead so she could properly witness the sea of sky blue – enhanced by smoke bombs – below. The roar from those fans at full-time was even more telling.“That reconnection between the players and the supporters is fundamental to building anything,” Mark Robins, the Coventry manager, said. “Coventry City supporters deserve the best and we have to try as much as we possibly can to give them that.“It is a brilliant, brilliant day for everybody connected with Coventry City – I couldn’t be prouder, couldn’t be prouder. Even though we were getting relegated the win here against Oxford [in the Football League trophy] last year was the start for me. It was the wood in the door stopping that slide.”Marc McNulty proved a livewire from the off, neatly dovetailing with Michael Doyle, described as “superhuman” by Robins. That particular combination was unsurprising given the pair are good friends, with Doyle influential in ensuring they ran out as team-mates this season. The Irishman “battered” McNulty’s phone, rang him 20-30 times in one week, sent him pictures of Coventry’s stadium and even met him at the airport after the striker flew down from Scotland. McNulty’s movement and Doyle’s guile was ultimately too hot for Exeter’s young, primarily homegrown defence to handle.After an impressive first half Robins’s message at the interval was to serve up more of the same and, within four minutes, an unlikely source had delivered. After staying upfield from a corner Willis made the most of a slick Doyle pass, stepping inside before wrapping his right boot around the ball, sending a thumping effort beyond Christy Pym.With one half of Wembley still reverberating, McNulty surged forward once more, bouncing off a couple of red-and-white shirts before spraying the ball wide to Shipley, whose shot deflected in off Pierce Sweeney. Grimmer then put the icing on the cake with a delicious curling effort. Playing in a one-off striped kit – its purpose questioned in more cynical quarters – after allegedly running out of their regular home strip, Coventry suddenly had victory sewn up.“The kit was a bit contentious but seriously – honestly – after the game against Notts County Jordan Shipley came in without his top on and I just said to him: ‘Where’s your top?’ and he said he gave it away and I said: ‘Well you can’t play at Wembley then, we haven’t got any left,’” Robins said. “But, thankfully we found another 700 that we were able to badge up and sell the rest. It was a one-off kit with a nod to the 87 cup final.”In the end it was a miserable bank holiday weekend for Exeter, with the city’s rugby union team defeated at Twickenham on Saturday. After successive play-off final defeats the Exeter manager, Paul Tisdale, is expected to relinquish his title as the country’s longest-serving manager, after 11 years and 336 days in the job.For Steve Perryman, the club’s director of football retiring after 51 years in the game, there was no happy ending, with Kyle Edwards’s late strike merely a consolation.Tisdale, a one-time team-mate of Robins at the Greek outfit Panionios 20 years ago, was non-committal over his own future and, asked as to where goes from here, his reply was canny. “Back down the M4, I get off at Wiltshire and go home,” the 45-year-old, who lives near Bath, said. “We will have a think in the next couple of days, get everyone together, and we have to start again. Exeter would like to keep me I believe, but we will have to see – that’s not a yes or a no.”"

Malatya is the world capital of apricots. Orchards full of stout apricot trees surround the Turkish city. On some downtown streets you can smell apricots on the breeze. There are bazaars dedicated to apricots, giant statues of apricots crown major intersections, there are apricot telephone booths, ATMs as apricots.Malatya is in the largely poor, conservative eastern interior of Anatolia and apricots define many of the poorer lives here – particularly of young women, who often drop out of school at 14 or 15, work in apricot processing and packing factories until they have enough for a dowry and get married young – often at 15, 16 or 17. They start having kids: families of nine or 10 are not uncommon and before long the lives of their daughters resemble theirs. Domestic violence is common, as is drug abuse.But some girls in Malatya have found a way to break this cycle – football. Ikranur Sarigul, 17, grew up with her nine siblings in a two-bedroomed house in Kiltepe, a low-income, conservative neighbourhood on the edge of Malatya. Breakfast was often just a few olives and she usually had no money for food during the day, while dinner might be some roasted onions. None of Ikranur’s five sisters had graduated from high school. Her elder sisters were married by 16 or 17.Ikranur’s parents worried about her; they were strict. At 10, she used to watch kids playing football in the street and it captivated her, but her family told her that football is for boys. But by 11 Ikranur was taking any opportunity to sneak off and play. When her family found out she’d been playing football they would yell at her and confiscate her shoes. It was frustrating. “I wanted to do what I love and I fell in love with football,” she says.As Ikranur approached her teens, her horizon was shortening and it would not be long before she would likely drop out of school, take a menial job and get married. But she was still playing football where possible. Dogan Deniz Celebi, her PE teacher in Kiltepe, invited her to join the school’s team. She did not tell him that her parents had forbidden her to play.I met Celebi, 41, in the centre of Malatya one day in early summer and we drove out to Kiltepe. The streets were largely empty as many residents were in the orchards picking apricots. Fences put together with lopsided panels looked like rows of crooked teeth. Ramshackle buildings quickly gave way to fields and orchards.Celebi started a girl’s school team around 2008, with the aim of keeping the girls in education and out of trouble and an early marriage. In the end, Ikranur had to tell Celebi that her family did not consent to her playing football. Celebi began paying regular visits to the family home, reassuring them and explaining the benefits. Their attitude softened – sometimes they let her play, sometimes they said no.Celebi then set up Malatya Bayanlar Spor Külübu – Malatya Women’s Sports Club – in 2012 to expand the project beyond the school. “I’m president, kit man, medic, bus driver and ball boy,” Celebi says. He convinced his family and colleagues to become members and to donate money. Much of his modest teacher’s salary was being spent on the club. “They became my daughters,” he said.The club – which plays in the third tier of women’s football – aimed to keep the girls in education but also to find them university places to become teachers or sports coaches. A Turkish Football Federation licence automatically gains credits that give a huge boost in university exams. “The main point was not only football – but to save the lives of the girls,” says Celebi. “Football was a tool.”Ikranur joined the team from its inception and she began to see a career path: she passed exams to get into a sports high school and aims to become a teacher. As her family saw the educational benefits more clearly, their attitudes shifted completely. At the sports high school Ikranur was improving dramatically, and she broke into Malatya’s first team. She admires Real Madrid’s Sergio Ramos. “The ball may pass, but not the player,” she says, laughing.I’m president, kit man, medic, bus driver and ball boy.The team also offers precious opportunities to travel. “It was maybe the first time they had stayed in a hotel, or ate in a restaurant in another city, or even seen another city. They could see there is a world beyond Malatya,” says Celebi. Football and travelling have given Ikranur huge self-confidence. “If you deduct football from my life, I am nothing.”But despite the project’s success, it is now teetering on the brink of collapse. Celebi has nearly exhausted his own resources, they have struggled to find sponsors. He blamed a lack of support for women’s football on Turkey’s gender inequality.Women won equality under law in the early years of the Turkish Republic and they gained the vote in 1934 – before many European countries. But Turkish society remained highly patriarchal, women were often marginalised, and some say it has become increasingly misogynistic and patriarchal under the socially conservative AKP government. The World Economic Forum now ranks Turkey 130th out of 144 countries for gender equality.Support from the Aydin Doğan Foundation saved the team from closure in 2015-16 and eight players got into university that year. It was not clear whether that support would be repeated. When Celebi told the girls that the club might have to close, some of them cried. “They said, ‘Why are you leaving us in the lurch? This is our future.’”This is an edited extract from The Passion: Football and the Story of Modern Turkey, published by IB Tauris on 30 March 2018."

Fan ire over the running of a club is hardly unusual, but the situation at Lille descended from discontent into utter catastrophe earlier this season. During their match against Montpellier in March, infuriated Lille fans vaulted the pitchside advertising boards, attacked their own players and had to be restrained by police while they threatened club owner Gérard Lopez with the chant: “If we go down, we’ll take you down.” Miraculously, the club pulled clear of the bottom three for good this weekend, but their Ligue 1 status remains fragile for financial reasons.For a club that won the title in 2011 and spent €70m on players in the summer – only Monaco and PSG spent more – this season has been, as Lopez admitted “a nightmare”. They beat Nantes 3-0 in their first match of the campaign but then didn’t win again until November. After a few decent results over the Christmas period, they fell into another slump, with just one win in 15 matches at the start of the calendar year.Two of their players were spotted leaving a nightclub in the early hours of the morning the day before their abhorrent, cowering 5-1 defeat at Marseille last month, which prompted supporters group Les DVE to release a statement bemoaning “these mercenaries who spend their weekends in Lille nightclubs indulging in alcohol following losses – these mercenaries who humiliate the club and don’t hesitate to disparage their fans home and away.” Director of football Luís Campos was even more direct, telling his players in the dressing room after the match: “It’s a disgrace, we’re idiots! Everyone needs to take responsibility!”On top of their disastrous league position, fan unrest and puerile players, Lille’s young forward Nicolas Pépé was benched for bringing a “weapon” to training and it emerged that a couple of players – including captain Ibrahim Amadou – decided not to turn up to manager Christophe Galtier’s video review the day after the Marseille defeat.If things were bad on the field, they were equally dire on the balance sheet. Lopez acquired the club in January 2017 and completely overhauled the squad but not without French football’s notoriously strict financial authority, the DNCG, starting to ask questions about the source of his funds and the integrity of the club’s budget. These issues led to a transfer ban over the winter and will finally be resolved at the end of the month when the DNCG meet to decide the club’s future, a meeting that could result in Lille’s automatic relegation, with the club having previously been told to raise €25m in sponsorship deals and transfer sales to avoid demotion to Ligue 2.Given all the turmoil, Lille’s turnaround on the field is all the more remarkable. The atmosphere around the club has been suffocating for some time and their almost prohibitively youthful squad has struggled to cope, with performances lurching from wayward to absent. Marcelo Bielsa’s radical redesign of the team left them leaderless, with Kévin Malcuit (26), Thiago Mendes (26) and Ibrahim Amadou (25) as the senior, and oldest, players. They all lack experience, even for their age. Galtier, an astute coach who excelled in bringing the best from an average group at St Étienne, replaced Bielsa in December and initially failed to make an impact.Then, a fortnight ago, things changed. Lille beat Metz to pick up their first win since January and then travelled to Toulouse, another club facing the threat of relegation. They went into that game sitting 19th, with just three games left to save themselves. With 10 minutes to play they were 2-1 down and their hopes of survival were evaporating.However, late strikes from Pépé and Yves Bissouma won the game and lifted Lille clear of the bottom three for the first time since February. With Toulouse, Caen and Troyes all failing to win this weekend, Lille managed to pull clear. Their third win in a row, against Dijon, carried them up to 15th in the league.With relegation avoided, at least for now, Lopez’ oddly entitled project “LOSC Unlimited” could yet flourish. Galtier’s squad may be inexperienced, but it is talented. Striker Pépé has been crucial in their run of wins; in Amadou they have a powerful midfielder who is often linked with the Premier League; midfield dynamo Thiago Mendes was superb under Bielsa; and marauding right-back Malcuit has been touted for a France call-up in recent weeks. Galtier remains a prudent choice as manager and the addition of more street-smart, experienced players over the summer could help them challenge for a Europa League spot next season.Lopez has always maintained that the club’s situation is secure. “I read somewhere that we were running out of money,” he said this weekend. “That’s not the case. We will finish the season without any problem.” He also claims the DNCG meeting does not pose any risks but, despite his confidence, they are unlikely to be as easily defeated as Metz, Toulouse and Dijon.• While Lille have done well to turn things around, their form has not been as impressive as that of Lyon, who had won eight straight matches before their trip to Strasbourg on Saturday. Marseille’s draw against Guingamp on Friday meant a win for Lyon would have all but sealed their top-three finish, but they conceded two late goals to lose 3-2. Young defender Mouctar Diakhaby, making his first league start in almost three months, was at fault to some degree in all three goals, but manager Bruno Génésio seems to be bearing the lion’s share of the fans’ rage. Perhaps their anger should be directed at chairman Jean-Michel Aulas, who failed to buy another centre-back in January. Lyon’s recent form shows they have the attacking talent to compete at the top of the table, but unless significant investment is made in defence (and defensive midfield, where there is no clear alternative to Lucas Tousart), Lyon are likely to find themselves scrapping for a Champions League position next season.• Elsewhere in the battle for the Champions League, Monaco hardly sparkled against Saint-Étienne, themselves hoping for a Europa League place, but the want-away duo of Fabinho and Thomas Lemar may have given the club an important parting gift. Lemar won a penalty and Fabinho scored it to give Monaco the only goal of the game. Neither player has been up to much this season, but returning to the club is no small matter before another summer of rejuvenation.• Finally, Rennes confirmed a spot in the Europa League with a surprising win at Paris Saint-Germain. The treble winners had little to play for, but Rennes were at less than full strength without Wahbi Khazri. Adrien Hunou was given the start in his place and turned in a surprisingly deft performance, not only scoring a cracking goal but generally proving a nuisance with his pace and ability on the ball. If Rennes cannot secure a permanent deal for Khazri, who is on loan from Sunderland, Hunou may prove a more-than-suitable alternative.Guingamp 3-3 MarseilleAmiens 2-0 MetzAngers 0-2 NantesBordeaux 4-2 ToulouseLille 2-1 DijonMonaco 1-0 St ÉtienneMontpellier 1-1 TroyesNice 4-1 CaenPSG 0-2 RennesStrasbourg 3-2 Lyon"

The city of Hamburg has seen significant regeneration in the past decade. In an effort to rid the city of its faintly sleazy reputation, as home of the Reeperbahn and the stag do delights it contains, a whole new district – HafenCity – was established with plans for modern shops, homes and entertainment venues. The most prominent of the latter was the Elbphilharmonie concert hall, an extraordinary structure that cost €789m, more than three times its initial budget.But as new buildings rise around town, the solid old pillars of their football club crumble. For the first time since the Bundesliga was established in 1963, Hamburger SV have been relegated to the second tier. Hamburg were the only side to stay in the division for that whole time, earning them the nickname Der Dino: not even Bayern Munich, who came up in 1965, had boasted such a lengthy continuous run among the German elite. A clock at their Volksparkstadion home proudly displayed exactly how long they had been in the top flight: that will be reset.The club that nurtured Uwe Seeler, of Manny Kaltz and Rafa van der Vaart and Kevin Keegan, European champions in 1983 under Ernst Happel and a stalwart of German football, will play in Bundesliga II for the first time. On Saturday they needed to beat Borussia Mönchengladbach and hope for a favour from already relegated Köln, who needed to beat Wolfsburg.However, the promise from Hamburg fans to send barrels of beer to Köln if they pulled it off did not quite work: Wolfsburg won 4-1, helped by a goal from the Liverpool loanee Divock Origi, rendering Hamburg’s 2-1 win over Mönchengladbach irrelevant. Wolfsburg are not yet safe: they face a play-off against Holstein Kiel, the third-placed team in Bundesliga II.In truth, this has been coming. Hamburg stayed up on the final day last season (beating Wolfsburg to do so, as it happens), and survived in the relegation play-offs in 2015 and 2016, on the latter occasion after an equaliser in the first minute of added time. “Economically speaking, Hamburg is the worst investment decision of my life,” Klaus-Michael Kühne, the businessman who has pumped millions into the club, said this month.This season has been more chaotic than most. Three managers sat in the dugout: Markus Gisdol was sacked in January after winning twice since August, Bernd Hollerbach lasted a winless two months, then the reserve coach Christian Titz was promoted for what looked like the last rites.Most expected Titz to simply prepare the side for the second tier, to perhaps take them down with a little dignity. Maybe he could give some young players a bit of first‑team experience. But in the end he presided over a near miracle. On 1 April they were bottom, seven points off the last safe spot, and a defeat to Hoffenheim a few weeks later left them eight points adrift with four games remaining. But he reinvigorated the team, winning four of their last six, including an extraordinary 3-1 victory over Wolfsburg that gave them late hope. The 13 points gained in Titz’s eight games in charge represent more than a third of the season’s total.Hamburg went out with a bang: in the last few minutes of the Mönchengladbach game fireworks and flares rained down from the stands, filling the stadium with smoke, either in frustration or protest from the fans. The last moments of Bundesliga football in Hamburg – for now, at least – included the pitch filled with police and the goalmouth on fire.Hamburg are down, after nearly 55 years. Still, at least they have a nice place to watch opera."

A group of around 50 people forced their way into Sporting Lisbon’s training centre on Tuesday and assaulted players and staff. ThePortuguese television channel RTP said that around 50 intruders, who had covered their faces to avoid being identified, interrupted team practice and assaulted players and staff. They also caused damage to a changing room.The club confirmed the incident, issuing a statement condemning “acts of vandalism and the attacks on [our] athletes, coaches and professional staff”.The Dutch forward Bas Dost, who has scored 34 goals for the club this season, reportedly suffered cuts to his head in the attack. Jorge Jesus, the team’s head coach, goalkeeper Rui Patrício and midfielder William Carvalho were also targeted, according to reports from the newspaper O Jogo.“Sporting is not this, Sporting cannot be this,” the club statement added. “We will take all steps to establish responsibility for what has happened and we demand the punishment of those who have acted in this absolutely regrettable manner.”The Portuguese league also condemned “the violent acts [that] the players and coaching staff of Sporting were subject to today. The perpetrators of these incidents are not fans of football. They are criminals.”Sporting missed out on a Champions League place last weekend after Patrício’s late error led to a 2-1 defeat at Maritimo, allowing their bitter rivals Benfica to leapfrog them into second place.Tuesday’s events at the Alcochete training centre 20km south of Lisbon mark a new low in a turbulent season. Last month the club president Bruno de Carvalho suspended 19 first-team players after a row on social media.Sporting are preparing to play the Portuguese Cup final against Aves on Sunday."

Mohamed Salah has said his ambitions for silverware with Liverpool extend beyond this season and that progress to the Champions League final represents the start of a new era under Jürgen Klopp.The Egypt international has been linked frequently with a move to Real Madrid, Liverpool’s opponents in Kiev on 26 May, during a debut campaign at Anfield in which he has scored 43 goals. The 25-year-old’s impact was recognised again on Thursday night when he was named players’ player of the season and player of the season at Liverpool’s awards dinner.Salah collected the prizes at Anfield before taking a private jet to London to collect another one, the Football Writers’ Association player of the year award. Before his departure, Liverpool’s leading scorer was asked directly about leaving the club only a year after his £36.9m arrival from Roma. “I’m very happy here, I’m very happy and everything is fine,” replied Salah, who is expected to be offered an improved contract by Liverpool.“I have got ambitions for the future with Liverpool. As you can see we had a great season and now we are in the Champions League final and everyone is excited. It is just the start. This is my first year here and it is the same for some other players. I didn’t watch all the games last season of the team but this year we have had an unbelievable year.”Liverpool need a point at home to Brighton on Sunday to secure a place in next season’s Champions League irrespective of the outcome against Real. Salah believes he can be part of a sustained period of success at Anfield.“We are very comfortable we will be playing in the Champions League next season,” he said. “On the way to the final we beat top teams like Manchester City and Roma. It is just the beginning. We want to qualify for the Champions League next season and then we want to win the Champions League final. We will play to win against Real Madrid.”"

It has been quite a week at the Montgomery Waters Meadow stadium. On Tuesday morning Shrewsbury Town’s squad trained on the pitch and gave interviews before Sunday’s League One play-off final with Rotherham. By the afternoon the city’s mayor was in situ, present to open a new section of the Salop Leisure South Stand. These 550 new rail seats were special, too; they formed the first safe standing section in an English football ground.“It’s been a very busy week to be honest with you,” says Brian Caldwell, the club’s chief executive. “We’ve got ticketing ongoing, we’ve got arrangements for Sunday ongoing and, obviously, safe standing is finished and ready to go. This year we’ve now created a safe standing area, finished third in the league and got to a play-off final and the Checkatrade final. We’ve had a successful season on and off the park and I think we take great pride in where we’ve come from.”Safe standing is an issue long championed by supporters’ groups but is only now gaining traction with those who run the game. For those who back the idea, safe standing is a misnomer; standing is not unsafe in and of itself, they say. In fact, it is a phrase that came into being thanks to Manchester City fans who wanted Standing Areas For Eastlands (the initial name of the stadium now known as the Etihad). Now SAFE standing is here and Shropshire got there first. It remains, however, illegal at grounds in the Premier League and Championship. The fact that the club will have to scrap it in three years if they get promoted is only a small cloud on the horizon.Shrewsbury’s plan has been 18 months in gestation and a work of grand collaboration. The process was initiated by the club’s supporters’ parliament, channelling the dissatisfaction of some Salop fans who missed the terraces of the old Gay Meadow, lost when the club moved to their all-seat venue in 2007. “A number of fans didn’t want to go in the first place, others missed the atmosphere,” says Roger Groves, the joint chair of the parliament and the man generally credited with having the first brainwave. “We spoke with Jon Darch and thought this could work for us.”Darch is the evangelist of safe standing. He says he is “someone who hates things that are illogical” and that denying fans the choice to stand at football grounds is one such thing. For the past decade he has devoted his life to the subject, driving a van fitted with a small sample of rail seating up and down the country. He is at the launch, in aviator shades and a fawn shirt looking like a lower-ranking member of the Corleone family. “It’s backbreaking stuff, I can tell you,” he says of his passion.Darch had been commissioned by the Football Supporters’ Federation to research safe standing in 2011. Through friends in Hanover he learned how it had been applied in Germany. He then got in touch with the company, Ferco, which installed the rail seating. It turned out it was British. Not only that, it was based in Shrewsbury. This was information that was of interest to Groves’ campaign.“It’s been a supporter-led initiative from day one,” says Caldwell. “I was keen to listen to it, look at it and then to get involved.” With the club covering a third of the £75,000 cost, and another £10,000 raised from the gambling company Fansbet, the majority of the funding came from fans via the crowdfunding platform Tifosy. “I think this was something the supporters felt they wanted,” says Caldwell. “It’s groundbreaking, it’s pioneering, it puts Shrewsbury on the map and we’ve worked really hard to make sure we get it right.”The seats were installed by Ferco, which also built the safe standing section at Celtic Park. Rail seating describes a metal seat that can be folded upright to stand practically flat against the row behind it. Above it there is a rail at chest height. This element adds safety, preventing people from falling from one row to another. The seats at Shrewsbury are unlikely to be used during matches but could be during other events, such as when Lionel Richie visits the New Meadow this summer.Ferco says it has received inquiries from at least half the clubs in the Premier League about rail seating. West Bromwich Albion, recently relegated, were one of those clubs but their application to trial a safe standing area in the Premier League was rejected by the sports minister, Tracey Crouch. There is growing pressure on her to change her mind, not least from the EFL. If Shrewsbury do get promoted to the Championship, and then stay there, they would currently have to tear out their rail seating after a three-year transition.Few celebrating the new section this week think that will happen. “Every club that’s building a new stadium is asking its architects to plan for rail seating,” says Darch, “People can see that it’s just about choice, allowing the fans that want to stand to stand. The campaign has been 20 years in the making but the argument is being won.”"

Modern life is a great advert for nostalgia. That’s why we started Nessun Dorma, a semi-regular podcast about football in the 1980s and 1990s. We’ve almost finished our first season, with just a few World Cup specials to come before we swan off to Ayia Napa together for an end-of-season beano. Since we were last on these pages we have released four new episodes, starting with a tribute to the greatest footballer ever.Lee Calvert, Gary Naylor and Rob Smyth pay tribute to the greatest footballer of all time (other viewpoints are unavailable). They look at all the things that made him great, from balance to bronca, and celebrate his never-ending list of highs and lows – from winning the 1986 World Cup single-footedly to being chucked out of USA 94 after failing a drug test. There is also a full rundown and rating of all the New Maradonas.Lee, Mike Gibbons and Adam Hurrey look at the complicated reign of Glenn Hoddle as England manager. The main focus is on England’s tumultuous France 98 campaign, when Michael Owen emerged as a star and England went out in the second round after an epic match against Argentina. Hoddle’s tactics were beyond reproach but his man-management invited much criticism. Was his man-management really that bad? Most importantly, they ask: what did Kenny G have to do with England’s World Cup campaign?Lee, Rob Bagchi and Scott Murray take a leisurely ramble through football as experienced through the cathode ray tube screen. They talk theme tunes, Saint & Greavsie, the Sky revolution, FA Cup final day marathons, spending five hours with Richard Keys and much more.Lee, Rob and Mike chat about 1992-93, the season that United finally won their first title since 1967. They look at the staggering impact of Eric Cantona, signed on a whim in November, and also how Sir Alex Ferguson righted the wrongs of the traumatic 1991-92 season, when United collapsed in the run-in. The panel also pick a team of the best (European) players never to play in the European Cup or the Champions League. Also, as per, Lee manages to somehow make a lot of United’s title win about Oldham Athletic.• You can subscribe on iTunes, listen on Acast, join our mailing list, follow us on Twitter, or discover our forthcoming episodes on the Guardian Sport Network"

Many Liverpool fans have thought about little other than the Champions League final for the last couple of weeks, waiting to find out if they have tickets in the ballot and paying eye-watering prices for day trips to Kiev, but Jürgen Klopp has put it all to the back of his mind.Thanks to the defeat at Chelsea last week Liverpool still need a point to guarantee Champions League football next season and Klopp has not been instructing his players to keep their focus on Brighton on Sunday afternoon without being willing to do so himself. “It would have been nice to do it earlier but now we have to do it on the last day,” the Liverpool manager said.“We have had a good season but now we have to deliver it all again. I have no problem concentrating on Brighton, I have not been skipping forward to think about Real Madrid.“I do not have a lot of skills but one discipline I learned early on was to concentrate fully on the next step, because in football if you don’t you can fall flat on your face. Brighton are a good team, in a position to play without pressure. We need to be careful.”Though Liverpool undoubtedly have had a good season, beating Manchester City on three occasions and reaching the Champions League final, even a win in their final game would take them to only 75 points, one fewer than they collected last season.“It’s difficult to compare one season directly with another,” Klopp said by way of explanation. “Last season we were not in Europe, for example. We would have picked up more Premier League points this season had we not been involved in the later stages of the Champions League.“For sure it feels to me like we have improved from last season, even if we had a few results that weren’t as good as they could have been. We have had many more good games than we played last season, some of them outstandingly good performances.“I would say 76 is obviously a bigger number than 75, but they are both big numbers. If 73 is good enough to get us into the Champions League that is a big number as well. Maybe we have not had the most successful season in the history of football, but it has been quite successful. I am fine with it so far, but of course we have to make the last two steps.”"

Perth Glory have made an enormous statement of intent by signing Tony Popovic as coach for next A-League season.Replacing the sacked Kenny Lowe, Popovic has been out of a job since his ill-fated stint at Turkish side Karabükspor ended in December after just 10 weeks.The 44-year-old had quit his post at Western Sydney Wanderers, who he had coached since their inception, on the eve of last season to take up the European opportunity.Popovic will be officially unveiled at the Glory’s awards night on Friday evening, along with a new CEO to succeed the departing Peter Filopoulos.It represents a new era for a club that has underachieved for many years. Glory were one of the powerhouse sides of the National Soccer League but haven’t won any silverware since the competition was shuttered in 2004.They have made the grand final only once since the advent of the A-League and while they made the finals twice during Lowe’s reign, the West Australian club has long struggled for consistency.Popovic, who guided the Wanderers to the 2012-13 A-League premiership and an Asian Champions League title the following year, said he was ready for the challenge.“I’m very excited to have the opportunity to coach Perth Glory, a club very rich in football history,” Popovic told Fox Sports News.“Now we’re at a stage where we want to create some new memories, some new history for this club and I’m really excited to be a big part of it.“The greatest excitement is the potential that the club has. The potential that WA has for football, the passion of the fans – the people love football there.“I’m very pleased to have an opportunity to untap that potential and together with the club, the owner, the players, I’m certainly going to put everything into it.”"

Jamie JacksonCity begin Sterling contract talksManchester City have held initial discussions with Raheem Sterling regarding a new contract, though the expectation is any agreement will not occur until after the World Cup.It is understood that a first meeting was held between the club and Sterling’s representatives at the end of last month. With the forward set to be named in Gareth Southgate’s England World Cup squad, talks may not resume before July.Sterling earns around £170,000 a week on a deal that has two years left. The forward is seeking to be one of the champions’ best-paid players and can expect a rise to his basic weekly salary of at least £50,000. City are intent on rewarding the 22-year-old for the most impressive season of his career in which Sterling has scored 22 goals and was a key factor in the title being claimed with five matches to spare.Pep Guardiola said: “The club, the chairman [Khaldoon al-Mubarak] and myself want him to stay a long time, renew his contract – but we are going on holiday in a few days.”Guardiola also expects Sergio Agüero to stay, though he could no be unequivocal. Asked whether the striker may leave the manager said: “I think it’s not going to happen. My desire is it will not happen, but I don’t know … Sergio is going to stay until he decides his time is over.”Brahim Díaz and Phil Foden have each made four Premier League appearances so need to make a fifth in tomorrow’s final match at Southampton to get a winner’s medal. “I didn’t know it but, all respect, it looks ridiculous to me,” Guardiola said of the rule. “If they want my medal I will give them the medal. They are champions – they worked from day one to the last one, training with us, in the locker room.”

It could well happen. But people start handwringing as soon as he has a quieter couple of months; it’s a ridiculous environment sometimes.

Are Leicester boring? Not after trouncing 10-man Arsenal, says Claude Puel!“I am happy about this game (Arsenal) because our last game it was not us, too poor, too boring, without intensity and quality. Without normal starting players we showed quality in desire and on the pitch. This is a good feeling for the next game and for the next season. From the kick off we put on the pitch more desire, energy, togetherness, and after we put our play in place. It is easier to play forward and give a good feeling.”They have the chance to cut loose again on Sunday when they visit the apparently joy-free zone that is Spurs.

Did you see the rumours linking Sergio Aguero with a return to Atletico Madrid (who seem to like luring their old star strikers back, don’t they?) this morning? Pep Guardiola has been speaking this afternoon – and, in this take from the wires, he says it’s – probably – not gonna happen:“I think it’s not going to happen,” said Guardiola. “My desire is it will not happen, but I don’t know. “It’s happened many times in these press conferences and I said maybe a thousand times Sergio is going to stay until he decides ‘my time here is over’. I said it last season and this season many times, and I say it today. That’s why I say it isn’t going to happen, but in football you never know.”

“I don’t think it’s been a great season,” says James Brown. Not that one. “This sounds strange as we’ve witnessed probably one of the most brutally dominant and tactically fluid teams in Premier League history, led by somebody who I think will come to be regarded as the best club manager in football history. Yet somehow this has ended up being a bit dull. Maybe we’ve got too used to the absurdly consistent brilliance of Messi, Ronaldo, Kane, Barca, Real etc, or maybe it’s the sheen of those teams and individuals that makes the stories at the other end of the table somehow more human and relatable: Moore at WBA, the story of Huddersfield, and Hodgson at Palace (who I think has done a quite incredible job).“The CL has brought the best out of our top teams rather than the league – to watch Spurs and Liverpool on occasions has been a real pleasure. As for my own team, Chelsea, it’s not been a surprise at all to see them struggle. Just frustrating they don’t seem to want to build on their success and instead seem to prefer to go through this continual up/down cycle.”

Interesting bits from Pochettino to digest in there, no? What’s your gut feeling? I suspect he’ll be there next season but a few games are clearly afoot.I also thought his comments, three entries down, about nothing being good enough struck something of a chord. Is that how it is to support a Big Club now? I’m curious. Have people talked and worried themselves into such a lather on social media, in particular, that they simply can’t enjoy being a football fan anymore? It kind of feels like that sometimes.

David HytnerPochettino also had the following exchange with the Sky Sports reporter. It’s worth nothing that it’s always the Tottenham manager’s style to rule nothing out in the future and to say that ‘anything can happen in football.’ But it still felt that there was a degree of posturing/ manoeuvring to it all ….Mauricio, are we guaranteed to see you here as the manager next season?What a question eh? It’s not my... you know, I still have three years on my contract. No point in talking about that. Only you know in football that everything can happen. No-one is sure in their job, but I have a three-year contract. Like I told the media in Spain after the game on Wednesday, they asked me about my contract and about what happened at some clubs, and I told them: ‘Look, I have a three-year contract and they need to agree with Daniel [Levy].’So you will 99% be here next season?No, today it’s 100%.Next season?I don’t know, but today it is 100% because I have a three-year contract here.

Andy HunterKlopp unimpressed at timing of awards eventsJürgen Klopp wrote a superb letter in praise of Mohamed Salah and Rhian Brewster to the Football Writers Association for their Player of the Year awards ceremony on Thursday, but is unimpressed with the timing of both that event and Liverpool’s own awards dinner on the same night.Salah collected the players’ player of the season and first team player of the season awards at Anfield shortly after 7pm on Thursday then flew by private jet to London to receive the FWA prize at the Landmark Hotel. He travelled straight back to Merseyside and, according to Klopp, still got an early night. But the Liverpool manager questioned the timing of the awards (usually held before the end of the season and players disappear en masse for their holidays/internationals) when his team still need a point at home to Brighton on Sunday to secure Champions League qualification for next season.“Mo deserved all the awards he got but I am absolutely not in the mood to praise anyone for the last few months,” said Klopp. “I am really in the mood to think about Sunday. Everything he did was fantastic, otherwise he couldn’t have scored that many goals, he couldn’t have played like he played, but it is all about Sunday.“It is quite difficult for a player because there are some many challenges constantly. The next challenge was the journalists. I know it was a very important award but to bring the boy on a Thursday night before the last game to London to celebrate a party - we are not partying. The journalists should come here and give the award. You want to be really focused. The season now for most of the teams in the league is a nice time but for us it is work.“All the awards around are really deserved but hopefully the last one was yesterday and now it is about playing the game on Sunday. We need to be completely focused on the game and we will be. Yesterday we had our LFC Awards – good timing. A lot of people wished me luck for the 26th and maybe two or three people said ‘good luck on Sunday’.”Updated

David HytnerMauricio Pochettino: “It’s strange that the feeling is not great”Mauricio Pochettino has had a moan about nothing being good enough for some Tottenham supporters and pundits. The manager has secured Champions League qualification for a third successive season – on a relative shoestring and after a season away from home at Wembley – but he wondered whether the club’s glass would ever be half-full.Pochettino noted how other clubs celebrate their achievements at end-of-season awards dinners but not Tottenham. His team made sure of a top-four finish on Wednesday night with a 1-0 Wembley win over Newcastle, courtesy of Harry Kane’s 50th minute goal. Yet remarkably they were booed off by some fans after a disappointing first-half.“In the last three years, we’ve achieved massive things, to play in the Champions League, and we never celebrate,” Pochettino said. “We never celebrate! At Southampton, we avoided relegation and finished eighth in the table and we had an unbelievable party. My wife was so unhappy, I remember, because I danced. Don’t worry, there’s no video.“But it’s true – that feeling that it’s never enough. We don’t have a players’ awards [night]. Clubs like Crystal Palace or Southampton, always there was a massive party at the end of the season. It’s a little bit strange that always the feeling is not great.“I remember we finished fifth in the first season and made the Europa League. It was better than in the previous season when we finished sixth, and it was: ‘Fifth is OK but it’s not enough.’ In the second season, we finished third but we lost the possibility to win the league against Chelsea with the draw at Stamford Bridge. Then we lost against Southampton and Newcastle, 5-1, and the feeling was so bad.“Last season, we finished second but it wasn’t enough because we didn’t win the league. And this season again, despite playing at Wembley and many things from the beginning, still there’s some [feeling] where it is: ‘Yes but no, the team needs to win some titles.’”Updated

If you don’t have six minutes to watch this, you can see the complete list of names (albeit first names, in the Icelandic tradition) right at the end. Gylfi Sigurdsson is passed fit enough, which is great news for them – and similarly Aron Gunnarsson. You can see people like Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Birkir Bjarnason in there too. Fascinatingly, young PSV winger Albert Gudmundsson, for whom there are high hopes, comes in.

JR in Illinois is a West Brom fan, so of course he’s feeling glum at what has passed since August, but he shows us some slightly more complex working than that:“My view of the Premier League season has likely been clouded by Alan Pardew relegating my club but I’d say this season has been pretty stinky. Man City was great for a while but even they became kind of boring. Man United played atrocious football and they finished second! Liverpool and Tottenham played some great stuff but probably their best parts were in the Champions League.“Outside of City’s probable 100 point tally and Wenger leaving there’s not a whole lot to remember about this season. At least I’ll have a new competition to follow next season with the Baggies back down in the Championship.”

I asked, a little earlier, if this had been an enjoyable Premier League season. Paul Fitzgerald has replied:“Yes but in a very prosaic way in that Man City were very nice to watch but their dominance removed any tension to proceedings. Its like when an F1 driver is laps ahead of anyone else and you have to source a duel somewhere back in the grid. You only cut back to the winner then when he crosses the chequered flag.”That’s true. My view is that it’s really not been a good season at all but that the symptoms, at least, go beyond the teams chasing City. Everything happening below, let’s say, seventh place just hasn’t been up to much at all. Throw it all up in the air next season and those spots could just as well come out in reverse – which ought to seem exciting but ... I ... don’t really know that it is.

Dominic FifieldConte: other people will judge our positionAntonio Conte believes Chelsea are stronger now than when he arrived at the club almost two years ago with the Italian insisting he has “created a base” through his stewardship.The FA Cup finalists travel to Newcastle on Sunday retaining only faint hopes of qualifying for next season’s Champions League, and with Conte expected to depart Stamford Bridge in the summer despite having a year left on his contract at the club. Yet, having inherited a team who had finished 10th after a turbulent season which had seen Jose Mourinho sacked and Guus Hiddink working as an interim, the head coach believes they are in a stronger position now than then.“For sure, we worked two years and worked very hard to try to build something, to create a base,” said Conte, who will confront Mourinho’s Manchester United side at Wembley in the Cup final later this month. “I think we did this. I’m the last person to judge the moment of the club. My task is to work, to do my job in the best possible way, and to work very hard with this team, with these players for the fans. Other people will judge our position.”Asked if it would be damaging for Chelsea to fail in securing a top four finish, he said: “I don’t know. I don’t know. You must know that there is this possibility, because you play in a strong league. For this reason, you have to know this and prepare in the right way. There are six top teams at the start of the season ready to fight for a place in the Champions League. It can happen.“In the past, it happened the same. Don’t forget two years ago, Chelsea ended the season 10th and not in the FA Cup final, not in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup, and they were eliminated in the last 16 against PSG in the Champions League. It can happen.“But last season after a 10th place we won the league. It was difficult. We worked very hard, but we won it. After a 10th place finish. Now, probably, you can finish fifth and start with a bit of an advantage compared to when you finish 10th.”Asked about the uncertainty which surrounds his own position at the club, he added: “I think I’ve been living with this speculation since the start of this season. I always said to you, my only thought is to do my job in the best possible way. To work very hard with my players. This is my only worry. Since the start of the first game, I think... I think the time I start listening to the speculation about me, this is the moment I start to be worried.”Updated

It must be exhausting, after a while, when you’re a lone beacon of sanity in a morass of dross:“I have decided that this year will be my last as a Swans player,” the 35-year-old told the club website. “It’s a sad day obviously, but this season has been very difficult for me.“I have had a lot of niggling injuries and I haven’t played a lot when I have been fit.

All that, and a fairly favourable draw. So why not?”I like the coach – Adam Nawalka – too and like a lot of the team, although I still think there’s a lot of responsibility on Lewandowski to win them games. But some of the other names, like Zielinski and Milik (if he can get back up to full steam), are pretty exciting. They should get through the group stage, for sure, and after that who knows?

We’ve come together and it’s led to positive performances and the results then followed. That was the important thing.

football,"Mohamed Salah, in the red of Liverpool, and Cristiano Ronaldo, in the white of Real Madrid, will be expected to score goals tonight worthy of European football’s annual showpiece

Two teams of 11 men apiece will emerge into the Olympic stadium in Kiev on Saturday night for the 2018 Champions League final but much of the attention of Europe’s fans will be focused on two individuals whose head-to-head battle is likely to define an outcome worth not just around £80m to the winner but pride and prestige of incalculable value.Mohamed Salah, in the red of Liverpool, and Cristiano Ronaldo, in the white of Real Madrid, will be expected to score goals worthy of European football’s annual showpiece. In that sense the two men play the same role but in very different ways and with strongly contrasting personal styles.A 33-year-old Portuguese who has spent the last dozen years competing with Barcelona’s Lionel Messi for the title of the world’s best player, Ronaldo has preened and strutted like a superstar since he was a teenager. In big matches he celebrates his goals by removing his jersey to reveal an astonishing display of musculature, tanned, oiled and depilated to perfection; it is honed by a ferocious fitness regime involving exposure to temperatures reaching -200C in a cryotherapy chamber, high-pressure water massages and improbable numbers of one-armed press-ups.He came to prominence under Sir Alex Ferguson with Manchester United before moving to Madrid in 2009 for a world-record £80m fee, having won every available individual award during his five seasons in English football. He has scored 121 goals in 156 Champions League matches and is on course to become the competition’s top goalscorer for an extraordinary sixth year in a row, with 15 in 12 matches so far in the present campaign. He has been awarded the Ballon d’Or five times – the same as Messi – and is the all-time top scorer for his country and Real Madrid.Salah, an altogether less self-conscious figure, spent an inconclusive season at Chelsea in 2014-15 before moving to Roma and rebuilding his career effectively enough to attract the interest of Liverpool’s manager, Jürgen Klopp. He returned to England a year ago for a fee of £36.9m – a relatively modest sum, given the world record stands at £200m – and is now the idol of the red half of Merseyside and all of Egypt.As well as bringing him player-of-the-year awards from his fellow professionals and the football writers, his 44 goals for Liverpool this season in all competitions obliterated fans’ painful memories of the loss to Barcelona first of Luis Suárez and then, this past January, of Philippe Coutinho. Each had been a prolific goalscorer; few anticipated that Salah, who had failed to impress José Mourinho while at Stamford Bridge, would outshine them both. Ten of his goals this season have come in the Champions League, carrying Liverpool to within touching distance of their sixth win in the competition.Ronaldo was born in Funchal, the largest city of Portugal’s Madeiran archipelago, where his mother worked as a cook and his father as a gardener. With a dedication to self-improvement that has impressed a succession of managers, he turned himself into the greatest Portuguese player of all time, his deeds eclipsing those of Eusébio, the Mozambique-born forward who won the European Cup with Benfica in 1962 and was top scorer at the 1966 World Cup. Ronaldo is bidding for his fifth European Cup winner’s medal while his club are going for their 13th title, and their third in a row.Salah is from Nagrig, a farming community in the Nile Delta, 80 miles from Cairo, where he was born into a middle-class Muslim family. His childhood was spent reading his schoolbooks during the long journey to and from training sessions with El Mokawloon, a Cairo club, involving several buses in each direction. Now he is Africa’s player of the year and his popularity at home is such that in the recent Egyptian presidential elections a million voters are said to have written in his name on their ballot papers.His Liverpool wages have subsidised a youth centre and an ambulance station in his home town, and he is building a school to provide a non-extremist Muslim education for girls and boys. Ronaldo has given money, including his £600,000 winning bonus from last year’s Champions League final, to many causes, one of them a school in Gaza.At their best each man offers a thrilling spectacle. Where Ronaldo surges and shimmers before bemusing goalkeepers with shots that weave and dip viciously, Salah simply explodes. From his regular station on the right wing, he cuts inside his marker and moves across the face of the penalty area before shooting with his stronger left foot, usually aiming to place the ball inside the far post.Both have alternative weapons in their armoury. Ronaldo, at 6ft 2in, has the power and the leap that enable him to score memorable headed goals. The 5ft 9in Salah exploits his low centre of gravity to twist and turn inside the penalty area, flicking the ball away from more cumbersome opponents with something of Messi’s mesmerising deftness.A sixth win for the pouting and obsessively groomed Ronaldo, now with the edge perhaps gone from his once blistering speed, or a first for the smiling, tousle-headed Salah, entering his prime propelled by an infectious optimism? Whichever way it goes, this is one final likely to justify the hype."

Antonio Conte warned Chelsea they would be losing a “serial winner” if they chose to sack him and said that, whatever the future might hold, he would always love the club.Conte watched his team dig out a 1-0 win against Manchester United in the FA Cup final to finish a trying season on a high. The trophy followed his Premier League title success from last season – his first at Stamford Bridge.Yet the Italian did little to clear up the uncertainty over his position, with the expectation remaining that he will not be around to fulfil the final year on his contract. Chelsea finished fifth in the Premier League this season and missed out on Champions League qualification.“When you are used to winning every season, this type of season can create some problems in yourself,” Conte said. “But I also think in a difficult season like this, I showed I’m a serial winner. To win in this way this season gives me more satisfaction than my wins in the past.”Conte made it plain that he would not and could not change his ways and that if the club did not want to carry on with him, he would understand. Equally, he said that he remained committed. It added up to a “back me or sack me” message.“After two years, the club knows me very well,” Conte said. “If they want to continue to work with me, they know me. I can’t change. I am this and my past speaks very clearly, as a player and as a manager.“I’m a serial winner. I showed this in England in a difficult moment for the club after a 10th-place finish [in 2015-16]. In two seasons, I brought two trophies for this club.“I have a contract and I’m committed for this club. As you know very well, our job is not simple. I understand that the club can make a decision, a positive decision or a negative decision. I’m the first to understand.“You have to understand if, in this season, we had the maximum or not. There is the possibility, with this group of players, that we did the maximum.“For sure, we’ll make the best decision. I’m the first to accept every decision for the future. After these two seasons, I will always love this club and these fans – also if my future must be in a different way.”José Mourinho said Romelu Lukaku had made himself available only as a substitute in the FA Cup final. Lukaku had missed United’s previous three games with an ankle injury.“I knew the opponent I was going to play against, that they have a compact low block with lots of physicality,” said the United manager. “Without a target man it would be difficult. When a player tells you he’s not ready to play, to start, then the question is: ‘How many minutes do you think you can [play]?’ How can I convince a player that is not ready to play?”"

The man who is set to be named as the new Arsenal manager has already joined the club – according to Unai Emery’s official website.On Tuesday evening www.unai-emery.com suddenly showed an image of the former Paris Saint-Germain coach on a red background next to the Arsenal badge with a message declaring: “proud to be part of the Arsenal family”.The 46-year-old is yet to be confirmed as the successor to Arsène Wenger but that looks a mere formality now.Emery left PSG at the end of this campaign after a two-year stint where he won one Ligue 1 title and four domestic cups, having led Sevilla to three successive Europa League trophies prior to that.Mikel Arteta, Luis Enrique and Juventus’ Massimiliano Allegri were among those strongly linked to the role and Emery had been seen as only an outside bet with bookmakers since Wenger’s departure was first confirmed last month."

There is a coming-together on the pitch, perhaps two players rising to contest a high ball or a player on the run being dispossessed by a sliding challenge. One, whose team are leading, stays down. He appears to be in pain. The physio is beckoned on and kneels over his man to administer treatment. After a while the ailing player is helped to his feet and is led, limping gingerly and wincing in apparent agony, from the field. But it is as if an invisible, all-healing forcefield rings the pitch, because the moment he hobbles across the white line he spins and demands to return to the fray. The referee waves him on and he sprints back to his position, suddenly in rude health. Attempting to deceive the referee by feigning injury is a bookable offence, for unsporting behaviour, but in these circumstances it is absolutely never punished, and not only does this tactic steal chunks of action from almost every match it often interrupts the flow, divesting teams of momentum. It is, in short, cheating, and annoying. Unless officials can properly enforce the law concerning unsporting behaviour, even retrospectively, another option is required. So how about giving each stricken player 60 seconds to get on with play, after which – unless they are bleeding, in which case they are already forced off the pitch for as long as it takes to stem the flow – they are obliged to leave the field for a period of no less than five minutes. You never know, the idea of placing your team at a numerical advantage might prove to have surprising restorative powers.To aid the tension and uncertainty that surrounds stoppage time, I offer a simple proposition, borrowed from rugby league: as soon as the referee believes that sufficient additional time has been played at the end of each half, an aggressively loud hooter is sounded. From that point, play continues indefinitely until the ball goes out of play (fouls conceded by the team not in possession don’t count – you can’t just kick someone to end a match), at which point the half/game is over. This is probably only a very marginal improvement on the status quo, and many matches would end with nothing more dramatic than the player in possession when the hooter sounds immediately blootering the ball into row Z, but in certain close-fought games I believe it would add a pleasing bonus period of total chaos.An unpleasant recent novelty has been a rise in the number of young fans going to games with signs beseeching a particular player to give them his shirt. Why do you want a dirty shirt? It’s just another thing in a world full of things. If you go home and try to tidy your bedroom, you’ll find you’ve already got more than enough things. And dirty shirts aren’t even good things. Creating a shirt-begging sign suggests an expectation that a free shirt might be the result; from that moment if he or she does get the shirt the moment will have been stripped of innocence and spontaneity, and if they end the day empty-handed they will be disappointed. I’m not suggesting players shouldn’t give away their shirts, however dirty and useless they are. The point is, and this is something I believe very strongly, children who go to matches with signs asking for things are precisely the children who should not be given things."

You don’t care about the Mill. You don’t want us to make ourselves happy by starting this bulletin of tittle-tattle with a playful, circumlocutory and almost entirely narcissistic introduction. No, you just want transfer gossip. We’ll never be anything other than a rumour buddy to you, will we.Fine, have it your way. The coy bromance between Gianluigi Buffon and Michael Oliver could go up a notch next season if – and this one might just merit an exclamation mark – Buffon accepts an offer to move to Liverpool! He has also, according to tomorrow’s super soaraway chip paper, been approached by Manchester City.Liverpool are also interested in Roma keeper Alisson, though we knew that after the Champions League semi-final: in some cultures, putting seven past a keeper is a sign of affection. Roma’s price of £87m is something we are contractually obliged to describe as a “stumbling block”. Liverpool may have more joy signing Lyon’s Nabil Fekir, though he is an attacker rather than a goalkeeper, so it’s not all fun and games under Jürgen Klopp’s baseball cap.Stoke’s body is barely cold and Spurs are looting it: they want tubby creative Xherdan Shaqiri for £12m. Manchester City are favourites to sign Napoli midfielder Jorginho. ‘Pep’ Guardiola also has an eye on Charlton’s 15-year-old Jeremy Sarmiento, who some people are calling the new Jonjo Gomez.If City sign Jorginho, then Manchester United will have a clear run at Shakhtar Donetsk’s Fred. He is one of the 142 signings they are going to make this summer; others include Willian, Monaco full-back Djibril Sidibé and an official fungal cream partner. United also want Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly, but so do Real Madrid and Chelsea. More to the point, Napoli want £104m.The more scurrilous gossipmongers are suggesting that Álvaro Morata is less than 110% happy at Chelsea and might do one at the first opportunity this summer. Borussia Dortmund and Juventus both want a piece of him. Chelsea, for their part, want to take Anthony Martial off José Mourinho’s hands. Leicester have agreed a fee for Porto right-back Ricardo Pereira, it says here, while Real Betis want to ease Newcastle’s Ayoze Pérez into their side.Mikel Arteta is still the warm favourite to replace Arsène Wenger as Arsenal manager, though Thierry Henry will meet to discuss the vacancy next week. Patrick Vieira, meanwhile, has misunderstood Roy Keane’s old comment about him “playing like you’re a nice guy”: he’s going to take over as Nice manager.Last, and incontrovertibly least because we’ve heard it all before and if we hear it one more time we’ll turn feral, Juventus will sign Emre Can from Liverpool and Matteo Darmian from Manchester United."

Robert Lewandowski wants to leave Bayern Munich, according to his agent Pini Zahavi, who told Sport Bild magazine that the Bundesliga’s top scorer “feels that he needs a change and a new challenge in his career”.Zahavi, the Israeli agent who helped facilitate Neymar’s world-record transfer from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain last year, said Lewandowski’s reasons “are not money or a specific club, as nearly all top clubs would like to have the world’s best striker in their ranks”.The 29-year-old Poland striker, whose contract with Bayern runs until 2021, has scored 106 goals in 126 Bundesliga games for the club since switching from Borussia Dortmund in 2014. He helped the team win the league each year, chipping in 29 goals this past season.Bayern’s chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, recently ruled out a transfer. “We know what we have in Robert Lewandowski. Nobody need worry, he will also play football here in Munich next year,” he said.Lewandowski parted with his previous agent, Cezary Kucharski, in February, when he turned to Zahavi. Sport Bild reported that Real Madrid’s interest has cooled after Lewandowski’s failure to score in the Champions League semi-finals against them, but claimed that PSG, Chelsea and Manchester United are interested."

Jack Ross has been appointed Sunderland’s new manager on a two-year deal. The 41-year-old who guided St Mirren to promotion was named the PFA Scotland manager of the year last season and will be joined at the Stadium of Light by assistant manager James Fowler.The Sunderland chairman, Stewart Donald, said: “We are absolutely delighted to have secured Jack as our new manager. Jack is excited to be a part of the future we are building here, and the fact he turned down lucrative offers from elsewhere, including clubs currently in a higher division than ourselves, is testament to his commitment and desire to succeed at this club and his belief in our vision for the future.“He joins us following an excellent start to his managerial career, including a memorable 2017-18 campaign with St Mirren, and was deeply impressive throughout the recruitment process. We have acted swiftly and the hard work now continues in earnest as we look towards the ultimate goal of getting Sunderland AFC back to where it should be.”Ross, who had been offered a new deal by the Saints, cannot wait to get to work on Wearside.He said: “This is a fantastic opportunity to take charge of an incredible football club. If you look at the history, the facilities and, most important of all, the fanbase, you can see what this club can be. To be part of the team to help realise that potential is something that fills me with excitement.“From the moment I spoke to Stewart and [director] Charlie [Methven], their energy and enthusiasm was evident and I share in that. There’s a lot of work to be done in reshaping the squad to ensure that we hit the ground running in League One, and I can’t wait to get started.”Scunthorpe United, meanwhile, have appointed caretaker manager Nick Daws on a full-time basis. The 48-year-old, who replaced sacked Graham Alexander in March, takes his first management post.“It’s something I’ve wanted to do for a really long time and I’ve waited patiently for the opportunity,” he said. “Fortunately for me, I can do it at a club that I’ve been at for three-and-a-half years.”"

Defenders in La Liga might want to consider plying their trade elsewhere if Diego Simeone is successful in constructing the most terrifying frontline since the Orcs lined up to do battle in the second Lord of the Rings film. It says here that Atlético Madrid’s evil genius will offer Leicester City a good chunk of the money he expects to receive for Antoine Griezmann from Barcelona this summer in exchange for Jamie Vardy, who he has been tracking since the England striker’s impressive display in the Champions League against his club last year, to partner Diego Costa. Just imagine trying to keep a lid on those two. It would be like marking a couple of werewolves. The Mill’s come out in a cold sweat just thinking about it.Liverpool’s Irish fanbase will be delighted to know that the club is this close to completing a deal for Lyon’s buzzy attacking midfielder Nabil Fekir, but beancounters will have to hand over £60m before the creative Fekir pitches up at Anfield. The France international could stick his boots in Emre Can’s empty locker when he gets there. The German will finally join Juventus on a free transfer when the Champions League final is over. Reports in France suggest Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere has emerged on PSG’s radar and discussions with incoming manager Thomas Tuchel will determine whether the club will make a solid offer to the soon-to-be-out-of-contract midfield schemer. Hector Bellerín may follow Wilshere out of the door but only if Juventus match Arsenal’s highly optimistic £50m valuation of the sometimes flaky full-back. And as for the identity of the next Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta is still in the box-seat to replace Arsène Wenger but the club want Thierry Henry to make a pitch for the job and may even sound out Unai Emery. Manchester City are hoping to seal next season’s Premier League title in the next few weeks by landing Eden Hazard from Chelsea for £100m. Everton are hoping to convince Crystal Palace to part with Wilfried Zaha by sending £60m whistling through the post in exchange for the forward. They can then put a big bow on him and hand the nifty dribbler to Marco Silva as a welcome present when they appoint him as manager next week.Zenit St Petersburg are considering offering Rafael Benítez a proper transfer kitty and the chance to manage them, having watched the Spaniard grow more and more frustrated at trying to squeeze coppers out of Newcastle owner Mike Ashley. If Benítez does stay on Tyneside he may try to sign Fernando Torres on a free transfer in the hope he can wind the Spaniard’s clock back 10 years, though Rangers boss Steven Gerrard could also be tempted into a reunion with his former team-mate who scored twice in his Atlético swansong on Sunday.Chest-control’s Marouane Fellaini has moved out of his Cheshire pad and will listen to offers from Milan, Besiktas, Marseille and Monaco when his Manchester United contract ends this summer. Southampton will try to prise Ben Gibson away from Middlesbrough with a £20m offer for the centre-back and Wayne Rooney is still trying to figure out whether booting a ball around for DC United is more appealing than picking splinters out of his backside at Goodison next season. Oh, and for some reason or other, Stoke like the cut of David Moyes’s jib and will offer the former West Ham manager the keys to the Bet 365 Stadium this summer. West Ham, meanwhile, hope to confirm Manuel Pellegrini as manager this week and then hope he can convince Yaya Touré that he is really, really, really, really, really wanted and appreciated at the London Stadium."

football,"Swansea’s cooperative, supporter-led ownership ideal once admired in the game has also fallen through the trapdoor in resentful circumstances
David Conn

Wed 16 May 2018 09.59 BST

A wider sadness surrounds Swansea’s relegation from the Premier League after an acrimonious couple of years than just the end of a romantic football flight. The “Swansea way” had more to it than the elegant style of passing football shaped through promotions by the managers Roberto Martínez and Brendan Rodgers.The cooperative, supporter-led ownership structure of the club was greatly admired and envied through the rise up the divisions but it was fractured by the majority shareholders’ sale in 2016 to the US investors Jason Levien and Stephen Kaplan.Richard Scudamore, the Premier League chairman, when pushed in 2013 to identify an ideal ownership model in the era of overseas financial investors, named the alliance at Swansea. A small group of mostly lifelong supporters led by the chairman Huw Jenkins put relatively small amounts of money in to save the Swans from extinction in 2001. They worked in partnership with the mutual supporters trust, whose members raised £200,000 to own 21% of the club and have a director elected to the board.That idealism and unity was shattered after the individual partners made millions personally by selling their shares to Levien and Kaplan, while not including the supporters in negotiations.Swansea fans were not slow to understand the deal and, as Jenkins remained the chairman with the team struggling, home matches have been played to a regular accusatory chorus of “you greedy bastards”.The trust, still deeply resentful, has taken legal advice about whether it has a claim that it was unfairly prejudiced as a 21% shareholder. A proposed deal agreed last year for Levien and Kaplan to buy half the trust’s stake was put on hold as the relegation battle set in.Jenkins is considering stepping down from his position this summer. A possibility is that he will stay on for some weeks to help appoint a manager to replace Carlos Carvalhal then stand down. Levien and Kaplan are not putting Jenkins under pressure to leave but are considering the need for more structure to the recruitment of players than having Jenkins in effect running the whole football operation.The Americans’ purchase valued Swansea at £110m, meaning Jenkins and eight other shareholders made 110 times the £1m collectively they put in to take over the then stricken club. The supporters trust – formed in those early days of the movement for fans to have mutual, democratic involvement in clubs – raised £200,000 for the 21% stake and played a major role in the wider campaign to save the Swans. The new owners quickly cut the club’s debts by entering into a company voluntary arrangement with creditors, then began the hard rebuilding. The upward trajectory was greatly boosted by the gift in 2005 of the Liberty Stadium, built with public money by Swansea council for £27m.[After promotion to the Premier League in 2011, Jenkins and other directors began to be paid significantly for the first time and the shareholders were each paid dividends totalling £4m from 2012‑15. They began to look at selling their shares but after the trust decided against selling to the US investors John Moores and Charles Noell, who eventually invested in Crystal Palace, Jenkins did not include the trust in his negotiations with Levien and Kaplan.Their offer to buy the club for a £110m value meant Jenkins’s 13.2% shareholding, which cost him £125,000, was worth £14.5m; he is understood to have made £7.7m from selling a 7% stake. The eight other individual shareholders similarly made millions of pounds each by selling their shares.Jenkins is now in conciliatory mood. “If, with the other shareholders, we could have done things differently, ensured the trust were on board with the sale, for the good of the club which would have benefited from a better atmosphere, I wish we had done that,” he said.Kaplan and Levien have not been criticised as vehemently as the former shareholders who sold to them, although some fans have voiced discontent at a lack of spending, after Levien and Kaplan paid so much to buy the club. When they took over, Levien said they would develop the club but never promised they would put their own money in to sign more players or expand the stadium.In February they did agree a new lease with the council, which they said would enable them to consider expanding the stadium. As part of the deal the club have committed to funding the construction of two new training pitches in Swansea for community use every five years.Swansea will look to make use of the £76m relegated clubs receive in parachute payments to try to bounce back to the Premier League but the club’s embodiment of an ideal is finished and there is plenty in that for football at large to lament."
football,"Fashion-conscious Dawsari heads to the World Cup after a loan at Villarreal as Saudi footballers begin to spread their wingsGreg Wilcox

This article is part of the Guardian’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.Saudi Arabian football, rather like the country, has always been a bit of a mystery to those outside the Middle East.Whereas many unheralded sides tend to have one well-known player – think Carlos Valderrama and Colombia in 1990 or Hristo Stoichkov and Bulgaria at USA 94 — when asked to name a Green Falcons star many fans, even those who consider themselves football encyclopaedias, would struggle to name one. Sami al-Jaber, the Saudi great who played for Wolves in 2000, might be uttered, or perhaps Saeed al-Owairan, the scorer of one of USA 94’s great goals. Bar that, the chances are high you might get a blank look.But, again rather like the country, times are changing.Saudi Arabian footballers, for so long the preserve of just the Saudi Professional League, are spreading their wings. This year a deal was done between the Saudi Arabian Football Federation and La Liga to loan nine players from the kingdom to Spanish clubs. Salem al-Dawsari was one and he, perhaps more than any other player, personifies the changes taking place in Saudi football.Not afraid to sport a new trendy hairstyle and as fashion conscious as they come – he can regularly be seen with his Gucci backpack – Dawsari would not look out of place on a Premier League team bus. He is one of the new breed of Saudi players and one whom the Green Falcons coach, Juan Antonio Pizzi, will depend on a lot in Russia.A winger with good close control and the ability to ghost past players, Dawsari’s talent needs to be harnessed by Saudi Arabia if they are to emulate the side of Owairan and co and make it to the knockout stages.His time in Spain, where he was loaned to Villarreal, bought two responses. There was the school of thought that felt it deprived him of game time and match fitness he would have got at his home club, the Riyadh giants al-Hilal. A similar argument was made regarding the other two internationals in Spain: Fahad al-Muwallad at Levante and Yahya al-Shehri at Leganés.Then there was the other side of the debate which argued that exposure to the training methods and players of a top European club could only help the development of one of the country’s top talents and potentially benefit Pizzi’s side in Russia.Time will tell which side of the argument is right, in the short term at least. But the sight of Dawsari helping turn the match for Villarreal against Real Madrid in May bodes well. The 27-year-old, having sat on the bench or in the stands since his move, came on with 33 minutes to go. Buoyed by scoring for his country in a 2-0 friendly win over Greece a few days before, Dawsari injected energy into Villarreal who were, thanks to Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo goals, 2-0 down.On 70 minutes he picked up the ball near the centre circle, exchanged passes with Rodri, then with Pablo Fornals, creating space for the former to set up Roger Martínez for Villarreal’s opener. Dawsari’s fellow substitute Samu Castillejo scored in the 85th minute to grab the point that ensured Villarreal finished fifth.Although such a cameo may not make Dawsari a world-beater, it would be foolish to underestimate its potential impact on the player. The one problem Saudi Arabia have when they arrive at World Cups is that the players’ exposure to top-quality teams and players has always been marginal at best. If that half an hour and his extended time in Spain give him a bit of extra confidence when the ball lands at his feet against Russia, Uruguay and Egypt in Group A, then that could be the difference between a surprise appearance in the second round and the expected early exit.Off the pitch Dawsari reportedly adapted well to life in Spain, with Pizzi telling Arab News during the national side’s May training camp, in Spain as luck would have it, that of the three players loaned out it was the winger who had picked up the language best.Three years ago al-Hilal fined Dawsari a month’s wages for trying to headbutt a referee at the end of the Riyadh derby against al-Nassr. Now more mature and with his Spanish experience to call upon, it would not be a shock if the winger made headlines for all the right reasons in Russia. Dawsari is perhaps a glimpse of the future for Saudi Arabian football – more international in its outlook and more prominent as a result. Who knows, the next time the Green Falcons turn up at the World Cup the names on the teamsheet might even be better known.Greg Wilcox is the sports editor of Arab News.Follow him on Twitter here.Click here for a profile of Saudi Arabia’s Salem al-Sahlawi."

Omar Beckles is speaking about the importance of speaking out; about the dark hole at the end of the downward spiral, how he would quietly break down in tears hours after a game and how he would grind and then clench his teeth following the death of his father, Linton.The passing at 59 of his father, a former singer with the jazz-funk band Central Line, when Beckles, after spells in Spain and on trial in Turkey, was playing for Aldershot Town in 2015, led to his problems. The Shrewsbury Town defender did not give himself time to grieve because he threw himself into “fight mode”, eager to help his family, particularly his widowed mother, Angela.“Dealing with the loss of her soul mate was not something I wanted her to go through alone; I didn’t want her to force herself into work,” Beckles says. “I wanted to be like: ‘OK, I can help her.’ I wanted to be the financial support that allowed her not to. But the burden I put on myself was my own burden. I created something that wasn’t really a thing.”At the two-bedroom family home in Walthamstow Beckles was at pains to be the “man of the house”, to look after his mother and younger brother Aaron, as well as his sister, Kamilah, who had moved back in. He shouldered the responsibility, which sharpened his focus, ultimately propelling his career forward. “But my mental capacity at the time was really bad. When I was at Accrington, there were times when I was playing, things were going well and I’d get back to my room and I’d be breaking down in tears. I kept putting pressure on myself.”It was to that east London council flat that Beckles returned after a third-round FA Cup replay defeat by West Ham United in January. “I’d gone from playing under the lights at the Olympic Stadium, leaving there after having a really good game and seeing reports that I had got like the best rating, to going home, climbing into the top bunk of the bed. It’s not as glamorous as everyone makes it out to be.”Talking during Mental Health Awareness Week, the 26-year-old candidly discusses his own struggles, the pressure he heaped on his shoulders but also how he hopes to make a difference through his Hub 365 foundation, recently set up to help those suffering in silence. “Each one of us goes through some kind of anxiety, depression or stress, and for me it is: ‘Can I help change this matter, this issue?’”Beckles, a devout Christian, is determined to help others – as his dad did. “Depression doesn’t discriminate, it doesn’t matter whether you’re rich, poor, whatever colour you are or whatever ethnicity you are,” Beckles says. “We all need to be able to open and express those things, especially as men. I feel like men tend to internalise a lot more, which obviously links to the suicide rates between men and women; it is far higher with men than women. You don’t really realise a space someone is in from how they express themselves externally. It’s vital to open up.”During his struggles his sleep was irregular. Beckles was grinding and then clenching his teeth to the point where Shrewsbury paid for an adequate mouthguard, the plastic one obtained at Accrington on medical advice no longer sufficient.As he says, it was no way for anybody to be living. “I would get locked jaw and in the mornings I literally wouldn’t be able to open my mouth for five or 10 minutes. I would have to do little exercises to loosen it and the doctor said that’s the tension of stress and maybe depression. For me, it was kind of like: ‘I need to get off this burden that I am carrying.’ I started opening up, speaking to my family and I just felt that release.”On Sunday week Beckles, who was released as a scholar by Millwall at 18, will play in the League One play-off final at Wembley. It will be his second visit there this season, after defeat by Lincoln City in the Checkatrade Trophy last month. He believes fate has afforded him the chance to play under that famous arch. His route there consists of 18 months alongside Sam Clucas and Jordan Hugill at Glenn Hoddle’s academy in Jerez, near Seville, as well as a trial at Kardemir Karabükspor in northern Turkey.“It was not glamorous at all – Istanbul is very much the lifestyle and image. I had done a medical and everything but there was this new rule about ‘active foreigners’ and I was never going to play in the first team, more of a prospect for the future, so if I went out on loan I would have been an ‘active foreigner’, so that killed that for me.”He returned to London and worked his way through non-league ranks after signing for Boreham Wood, obtaining his Uefa B coaching licence and futsal qualifications along the way.“Every season, for the past four seasons, I’ve gone up a league. And to be on the brink of being able to do it again with the team, rather than getting a move, is just surreal. I didn’t dream or fathom being in this predicament playing at Billericay or Hornchurch. I might have said a few blasé comments about getting into the Football League but I never thought I’d be able to experience playing at Wembley. I feel so, so blessed.”• In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Other international suicide helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org.• Shrewsbury have become the first League club in England or Wales to introduce safe standing at their stadium. Work to install 555 rail-seats in the Salop Leisure South Stand began on Monday. “We are stepping up a level on the pitch but it also feels like we are noisy neighbours in terms of safe standing,” said Roger Groves, the joint-chairman of the club’s supporters’ parliament.• After scoring the winning goal to stave off relegation on the final day of the season, Joe Thompson, who has twice recovered from cancer, has been offered a new contract to stay at Rochdale.• Martin Allen is on the move again, this time at relegated Chesterfield. Last week the 52-year-old left Barnet, also relegated from League Two."

Ruben Loftus-Cheek described his World Cup call-up as surreal, and there have been plenty of times in the recent past when he would have considered the chance coming his way this summer the stuff of fantasy. He could point to the plateauing of his senior career on the fringes at Chelsea or, having joined the club’s considerable loan army, the trauma of Crystal Palace’s appalling start to last season. Then there was the three-month hiatus in mid-winter as an ankle injury checked the momentum generated by regular game time.Thoughts of Russia must have been distant as he listened to Roy Hodgson attempt to lift spirits after a 5-0 drubbing at Manchester City in September or as he embarked on that lonely spell of rehabilitation in January. It is testament to his character that a player capped for the first time last November, with a commanding debut against Germany, has regained his place in Gareth Southgate’s squad on the back of considerable potential and six eye-catching performances over the final seven weeks of term.“I am ready for it,” he said of the World Cup. “I’m not one to bow under immense pressure. I know how to deal with it. As a youth player growing up and playing for England you deal with it then and get used to it. You just carry on into the bigger stages and it has become natural to me. Playing at the World Cup stage excites me.” So much for the shirt weighing heavy.Loftus-Cheek’s self-assurance is remarkable for a player who, at 22, has only 27 Premier League starts to his name – his last for Chelsea in April 2016 under Guus Hiddink – but is born of the challenges he has overcome. The academy at Cobham had considered him a poster boy, a powerhouse who joined aged eight with the world at his feet. José Mourinho had him training more regularly with the seniors at 17. “I was in awe,” he recalled of initial brushes with the first team. “I remember Didier Drogba being there for my first session.“I’d watched him on TV score so many goals and there I was, still so young, getting that nervous feeling. The thing that struck me was the physicality of it all but also the speed of play. The understanding of the game, knowing the next pass, the opposition ... that is often what sets the top level apart. Training with the first team, you obviously toughen up through the physicality but your speed of thought improves – it has to. You need to know the next pass and what you want to do.“I’d been at Chelsea for a while and progressed quite quickly until I got to the first team, and then it was different. I was used to playing every minute of every game but when you get to that level the step up is massive. There are world-class players in front of you and, no matter how talented you are, breaking in is difficult. I improved a lot with the training, because the coaches and the facilities are the best, so I grew as a youth player in the academy. But I do think when I got to that 17-18 stage ... maybe looking back now, I realise the benefits of playing game after game. Maybe I could have gone out on loan sooner. In that sense I wish I had played more games.”At Palace he grew, particularly in an unbeaten end-of-season run. Opponents virtually bounced off him when he marauded up-field, unable to rob him of the ball. His blend of deceptive pace, fearsome power and no little skill had Hodgson declaring him a player “without any weaknesses”.Southgate would like to see him charging into the box and shooting more. The calmness of his finish against Leicester last month was an indication he can become a more regular scorer.Chelsea will use him more regularly next season, when it would be politically unacceptable to farm him out again on loan. He made only six substitute appearances under Antonio Conte in the title-winning campaign. “But for me to be around a squad of winners was good, so I could analyse and see the dynamics of the squad and the team,” he said. “Then to be at Palace, who struggled at the start of the season, and see how my team-mates reacted when they were not doing so well. In the future I’ll know what is needed to get out of a situation like that.“I’m not afraid of any competition. I’m not going to be intimidated by any player or team. That is fundamental in football if you want to do well. I will take that mindset into the World Cup.” His chance has come, and he is not one to let that opportunity pass him by."

While the Duchess of Sussex, Brighton’s newest celebrity fan, opted for a Givenchy wedding dress with boatneck neckline, long sleeves and an even longer train at Saturday’s Royal Wedding, belt and braces were very much in vogue at the day’s other aristocratic event some miles away at Wembley Stadium. Both José Mourinho and Antonio Conte went for an identical, monotonously predictable safety-first approach in Saturday’s FA Cup final, with the latter’s being heavily criticised by the former, who somehow managed to keep a straight face as he mournfully described Chelsea’s tactics as “so predictable”, announced that “I don’t think they deserve to win” and managed to imply Manchester United’s defeat was entirely down to the absence of a Belgian battering-ram in whose direction the ball could be hoofed, if only that battering-ram hadn’t selfishly decided to prioritise participating in the World Cup with his country over trying to win the FA Cup with his club.In a further boost to Belgium’s World Cup hopes, José picked Phil Jones ahead of Eric Bailly, having previously claimed he was resting the Ivorian so that other Manchester United players could stake their claim for World Cup starting spots. After performing his latest impression of an ageing shire horse locked in a spinning tumble-dryer while conceding the penalty that decided the match, The Fiver is struggling to shake the feeling that United’s manager might have done the defender more of a favour by picking somebody else instead.While José looks likely to be rewarded for Saturday’s failure with a £150m summer war-chest to buy some defenders of his own choosing, Antonio Conte’s prize for winning his second trophy in as many seasons for Chelsea may well come in the form of a P45, a hefty pay-out and a hobnailed boot towards the Stamford Bridge door marked “Do One”. Having said he has no control over what happens next while simultaneously conveying the impression that he’s not too fussed either, it was left to his players to discuss the Italian’s future. “What I can say is that the players do not have any impact on the situation,” chirped Gary Cahill, while Willian, a starter of just four full games for Chelsea this season under Conte, tried to prove otherwise courtesy of several – since-deleted – strategically placed emojis.“I once showed Vincent Kompany to his seat.

And now the end is near. And so we face the final curtain or at best a rather demob-happy, oddly tension-free final flutter of a curtain that fell some time ago for most of English football’s top tier.Sunday’s final fixtures of the Premier League season will be played out in the usual conjoined fashion, simultaneous kick-offs designed to offer last-day drama and a level playing field to the final jostle for air and space.Except this year things are a little different. Those shared three o’clock kick-offs will serve only to illustrate the lack of tension at the fag-end of the season, the fixtures lined up like a taxi rank at midnight, lights on, engines idling, contentedly at rest.The last remaining notes of uncertainty in the Premier League are wrapped up in unlikely mathematics. It is possible Liverpool might lose to Brighton at Anfield while Chelsea win at Newcastle. On the other hand Brighton have nothing to play for and Liverpool have yet to lose at home in the league this season. In all likelihood the top four is already a lock.Below that the Europa League places are safely packed away. The only real drama of the past few weeks has lurked at the bottom. But as it stands Swansea, who cannot score, need to enact a 10-goal swing on Southampton to avoid sliding away along with the pre-doomed West Bromwich Albion and Stoke City.This sense of stasis is at least in keeping with the season as a whole, nine months that have provided a strange mixture of energy, colour and sweat, laced through with a peculiar air of predestination.Not that the Premier League’s promotional machine will be overly concerned as the season unspools into its final dreamy sunlit Sunday gadabout. This has been another fun, colourful season for a hugely successful product – lacking only in some vital note of tension.This is unsurprising. Never before has the gap between the richest and the poorest been so stark. Much hand-wringing has been devoted to this process over the last quarter century but this season feels like a significant point of departure, with the summit that separates the richest and most powerful disappearing up through the clouds and out of sight.In a sense this has its own kind of tension. It has become habit to lament the death of the FA Cup, with its folksy old notes of drama and upset, the social order briefly reversed. But the Premier League can provide this on its own now, a bespoke league pyramid all in one fixture list.Perhaps Huddersfield successfully avoiding relegation is a modern-day stab at a third-round Cup shock. Perhaps in time David Wagner’s round of arse-baring on-field bumps after the final whistle at Stamford Bridge will become our own parka-clad mods pouring out on to the Hereford mud, those moments when careers are made and legends forged, on this occasion simply by remaining in this most vertiginously stratified league.In many ways these are the twin themes of the season. More than ever power is set one way, as reflected in finances, possession stats, the one-sided nature of so many meetings within the same league. Ranged against this is football’s basic resilience, the ability of the game to resist whatever we do to it, to keep on churning out its notes of beauty and fascination, finding new forms even as its surrounding weather is drastically altered.The champions embody this most completely. The title race to all intents ended in October, the day José Mourinho’s Manchester United went to Anfield and winkled out a cautious 0-0 draw from a game in which they had a single shot on target. Mourinho defended his tactics energetically, pointing to the many twists to come, the attritional nature of the league season. He was wrong, though. The only way of hoping to catch Manchester City is to try to win like Manchester City, a team so stacked with goals and talent, so adept at depriving their opponents of meaningful contact with the ball that the majority of their Premier League encounters became near certainties.And still there is that paradox. Despite being a project geared towards removing uncertainty and variables – best tactics, coach, talent, money – City have been hugely compelling champions, not just unusually uplifting to watch but also lurking on the side of the light, such is the purity of Pep Guardiola’s commitment to his tactics, his ability to find new depths in already excellent footballers. Record points, record goals scored: this has been one of the most watchable one-sided winning runs one could hope to see.There is an end point to this. The Premier League has had nothing even vaguely resembling a title race since 2014, Demba Ba and all that. Even the miracle of Leicester City was something of a stroll without its underdog backstory.The gap at the top of the Premier League is even larger than it is in France, where the league really is an exercise in managing dead air. In La Liga the gap at the top is 15 points, in the Bundesliga 24. Europe’s domestic leagues have a problem, an absence of internal energy. It isn’t immediately clear what the answer might be. But too often the late stages of the Champions League, where power finally meets equal power, have provided the only note of interest in the spring.The Premier League has at least offered some fascination within the usual internal tiers, the leagues within the league. Manchester United and Tottenham have had fascinatingly indeterminate seasons, soundtracked by a basic existential confusion over what success is supposed to look like these days.United will finish second and may win the FA Cup. And yet the surrounding weather has been choppy, the sense of stalled progress there in the unease at Mourinho’s defensive tactics, a squad packed with trapped attacking verve that has only rarely played with freedom. Mourinho is already sharpening his cleaver before the summer. An improvement in results and, more vitally, style is required, if only to still the sense of ambient unease.Lifestyle football: this has been another regular note in the season, with Everton fans among those demanding not trophies or local derby victories but an improvement on the tone and texture of the football their team plays, demanding to be entertained at the very least. It is hard to argue with this in the league of stasis, a place where there is little else to aim for with any real sense of hope.Tottenham remain perhaps the most interesting club in the upper reaches, run at a profit, playing fine winning football but still gripped with that basic confusion over what adds up to success, though not so much internally. For Mauricio Pochettino a Champions League season in the new stadium has always been the priority, domestic cups be damned.Lower down the table it looked for a while as though this might be the year when the managerial old guard were finally junked, with shared howls of unhappiness as David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Alan Pardew and then Mark Hughes continued to maintain what appears to be a revolving Proper Football Man job share.The reality is perhaps a little different. Even slightly haggard middle-aged men tend to have their own distinct personalities and Moyes deserves credit for keeping West Ham in mid-table without any significant new manpower.Pardew tapped into another strange new anxiety, a weakness among some club owners to aim for a dimly conceived idea of entertainment and progressive, free-flowing football. Pardew was hired with a brief to unlock the talents of some ambitious signings, relax his players, primp the brand. In the event it was a disaster, an ill-matched confusion of a bold, peacocking public persona with sound mid-season footballing sense.Tactically there is, as ever, an urge to spot new trends, even if these can disappear just as quickly as they are detected. Certainly there has been an agreeably attacking trend. Jürgen Klopp’s blitz-football, those moments when Liverpool enter the red zone and attack in a dizzying swarm, have provided some of the moments of the season. The progress made by the player of the season, Mo Salah, has been stunning, with a rare joy in watching a supremely talented player reach out to the far fringes of his own attacking gifts.Further down the willingness to attack has also been rewarded, with Roy Hodgson providing one of most quietly heartening stories of the season at Crystal Palace. The freedom with which Wilfried Zaha and Andros Townsend performed, resurrecting a moribund team in autumn, has enlivened a league that for all its slight sense of claustrophobia, of being settled, remains impossibly watchable .Of all the many farewells and end notes one looms above everything else. Probably Arsène Wenger should have gone two years ago, possibly six or seven if the more disaffected fans are believed. Arsenal may now begin to cash in his legacy in earnest. Either way he leaves behind a club that will now become just another club like the other clubs, aspirational but also held in place by a hierarchy that looks as set as at any point in English football history."

On a sweaty, heavy, oddly gruelling Wembley day Manchester United’s sweaty, heavy, oddly gruelling season was finally euthanised to a close.It has been a good season in some ways, with obvious progress made in the Premier League. But it passed here without the garnish of a trophy as Eden Hazard’s first-half penalty settled a largely forgettable FA Cup final in Chelsea’s favour.Chelsea have had a mixed season, too. Victory at Wembley was a reflection not of a team finding its gears, but of the fact in Hazard they had the best player on the pitch, enough to make a difference even in just the briefest glimpse.For United this felt like something else, a dose of necessary medicine where the gleam of another trophy might have concealed the symptoms, hid the deeper snags and knots. Either way it seemed a fitting reflection of United’s status right now to end the season watching this sluggish red‑shirted machine spend 90 minutes trying and failing to score a goal.This remains the single most interesting thing about this powerful, strangely burdened team. From Anfield to St James’ Park, from Andalucía to Ashton Gate, United’s season has been a heavy kind of thing, with a sense throughout of trapped energy, of cogs that refuse to click, of results wrung out of bloody‑minded will.Look back and this has been the one constant of the post‑Ferguson era. Through five years and three managers successive teams have shared this clogged aspect, lacking in the vital notes of grace and fluency. Against all expectations Manchester United have somehow become the Daleks.Mourinho’s team has now ended the season with seven goals in their last eight games, with fewer away goals than Leicester in the league, with a single goal over 180 minutes against Sevilla, with four goals in a game just once since a fine scoring run in the autumn. Albeit, even in those most liberated moments there has been a clanking quality, like an android replicant making brief, sullen attempts to dance the Charleston.If any player embodied this struggle at Wembley it was probably the frantic figure of Marcus Rashford, who was never on his heels, who ran constantly, passed accurately; but who seemed throughout to be playing through a kind of fog, blunt when he needed to be sharp, a player making all the right runs, just not necessarily in the right order.With Romelu Lukaku unfit for anything more than the bench this was a wonderful opportunity for Rashford to play as a starting centre-forward in a season-defining game. Not that his year to date had provided much significant preparation.Rashford did get a start as a centre-forward against Brighton just a couple of weeks ago, a game that inspired a pretty wretched piece of public politicking from Mourinho afterwards. “Why always Lukaku? Now you see why,” was the verdict of a man charged with building the confidence, self-esteem and general pastoral wellbeing of one of the brightest young attacking talents in England. Or not, as the case may be.Here Rashford lined up just ahead of Alexis Sánchez here in a vague, ungrooved, energetically incoherent impersonation of a two-man attack. After five minutes and 30 seconds someone in a red shirt finally passed to him. For a while he made runs: curving runs, runs across the back three, runs behind the full-backs. After all it’s good to keep yourself busy. Meanwhile a football match happened 30 yards away.Rashford is still only 20 and in the middle of one of those difficult seasons young players are allowed to have. The wider issue is the sense of a player drifting into a kind of dead zone where he seems unsure not just of his role but of his own basic skills.Mourinho’s keenest fans will be eager to excuse him from any part in this. But something is missing here. Rashford has talent and willing. There has simply been no development, just a sense of irritation that this young player is not a ready-made elite No 9.Either way Rashford looks more like an over-promoted youth-team player now than when he actually was one. Certainly it is clearer than ever how important Lukaku is to José’s United. Second balls, bouncing off defenders, fighting for scrappy possession: this is the job now.United did surge after half-time, making concerted attempts to force the ball through Chelsea’s lines in a red-shirted bludgeon. With no obvious attacking plan, United went into blitz mode, midfield storming forward, the full‑backs battering in crosses. But they never really threatened to find the right forward gear.There is nothing wrong with defensive football, which has its own kind of beauty. Mourinho has been the master of victory through constriction, and in the process has provided some of the most memorable and overachieving European teams of the last couple of decades.But the past tense is significant here. Reactive, strangulating football remains his base note, but it is hardly reflected in the wider world where the most successful teams tend to pour their energies and planning into moving forward, concentrating on the weaknesses not the strengths of an opponent.No goals: no trophy. The extent to which Mourinho is willing, never mind able, to regear this United team over the summer will surely be key to the immediate future of both."

Mikel Arteta has emerged as an increasingly strong contender to replace Arsène Wenger as the Arsenal manager, with members of staff at the club expecting him to be offered the job.Arteta, the former Arsenal captain, is building a reputation as a coach at Manchester City but he continues to be much admired by the Emirates chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, who is heading the drive to find Wenger’s successor.Gazidis said on the day Wenger’s departure was confirmed that it would be important to be bold with the choice while he also alluded to how Arsenal had placed their faith in a relatively unknown manager in Wenger in 1996. “When Arsène was appointed, I don’t think he was on many people’s radar screens,” Gazidis said. “We need to be bold in the appointment.”Gazidis remembers Arteta from his five years as an Arsenal player as the consummate professional and he knows the Spaniard from the Basque region would be able to represent the club around the world with dignity and be a convincing lead voice on the technical side.Arteta has learned a good deal under Pep Guardiola at City and would have no qualms about working within the structure Gazidis has put in place at Arsenal, with Raúl Sanllehí – like Guardiola a Catalan – and the German Sven Mislintat in key recruitment positions.On the other hand, were Gazidis to turn to Arteta, it would represent an enormous gamble. When the club appointed Wenger to the infamous “Arsene Who?” headline, he might have been unknown in England but he had won the French league title with Monaco and taken them to the European Cup Winners’ Cup final.Arteta does not have a single game in management to his name. Max Allegri is the other name that figures prominently on Arsenal’s whittled down shortlist but there is concern he could be minded to stay at Juventus for another season to chase his dream of winning the Champions League with the club. Arsenal will push to see whether he can be tempted but Arteta is a realistic option."

Chelsea will meet Maurizio Sarri’s representatives on Friday as they consider potential successors to Antonio Conte, who is widely expected to exit the club this summer.The Stamford Bridge side continue to weigh up the future of Conte, who warned Chelsea they would be losing a “serial winner” if they decided to replace him after winning the FA Cup at Wembley last weekend. “After two years, the club knows me very well,” Conte said. “If they want to continue to work with me, they know me. I can’t change. I am this and my past speaks very clearly, as a player and as a manager.” Napoli appointed Carlo Ancelotti as Sarri’s successor on Wednesday after the latter guided the team to a second-place Serie A finish in his third and final season at the club.The 59-year-old Sarri – who has never managed outside of his homeland – has received an offer from Zenit St Petersburg, understood to be worth around £5.2m a year. It is believed that Sarri’s preference would be to join Chelsea but it is not clear whether he is the club’s primary target. He has an England-based representative charged with finding him a job.Following Napoli’s 2-1 win over Crotone, which saw Napoli end the season with 91 points before his exit was confirmed, Sarri told La Gazzetta dello Sport: “What I do think is that I could not go directly to another Italian team, and that if I had to make a change I would prefer to go abroad. Everything in life ends and it is better to finish things after writing a beautiful story.” "

It is that time of year again. The hawthorns are in bloom. The cow parsley is high. Men in shorts have already begun to gather cautiously in public places, puffing their chests, milk-white ankles proudly bared. And by Wednesday lunchtime mid-summer will make an early appearance with the announcement of an England squad for the World Cup in Russia.It is generally assumed Gareth Southgate is getting his selection for Russia 2018 out there a little early for the simple reason the squad basically picks itself. In the best possible sense this has become the most managed, carefully pondered England era, with no place for the last-second celebrity metatarsal dash, the drama of the Hoddle-style hotel squad countdown or any kind of Crouchie-doing-the-robot for Prince William triumphalism.Even now some insist on calling Southgate an FA man, a stuffed blazer there to manage by committee and shore up his own position. This is presumably a kind of prejudice based on his lack of star wattage, a route taken into the job via the youth teams that would in any other country seem entirely logical.To others Southgate may still seem a little nice, coming across in his first year in the job like the kind of soulfully doomed supply teacher who tries to engage with the kids by talking to them about their feelings, but who will inevitably get home and discover his briefcase has been filled with custard and someone has written “div” in chalk on the back of his jacket.This is to misjudge him. In reality Southgate is a reformer in the most low-key, quietly English tradition. The two best parts of his time in the England job have been his refreshingly brusque approach to the selection of celebrity or big-club players who are either over the hill or unfit; and secondly the intellectual rigour to pursue a system and a set of tactics to the exclusion of most other considerations.It is to be hoped Southgate’s first tournament squad can reflect these strengths. This is not the moment for turning back as so many have in the past. As recently as the buildup to the last European Championship Roy Hodgson embarked on a series of bold friendly international experiments before losing his nerve at the last and reinserting Wayne Rooney into the centre of his young England team like a teeth‑sticking deep-fried jam doughnut plonked into the middle of a light rocket salad.The player pool may be shallow. Southgate himself may have predicted a no-shocks selection but there is still time to make a statement on the details. There are three ways Southgate can go when the squad offers a choice. He can pick a form player; he can pick a faithful name from a well-known club; or he can pick a young player with the capacity to put into play his distinctive vision of the passing game, that high-energy patience football that someone somewhere has decided is the English footballing DNA.Generally England managers have gone with the well-known names. Hence a succession of interminable, largely inconsequential tournament careers for middling players from A‑list clubs.In practice this is the difference between picking Danny Welbeck or Ademola Lookman in attack; between picking Trent Alexander‑Arnold or Chris Smalling as a defender (with Kyle Walker as a right-sided centre-back making this a reasonable toss-up).Neither of these choices is likely to have any lasting effect on the destiny of the 2018 Fifa World Cup. But the look and feel of an England squad, the sense of social mobility, of some kind of shared purpose to the squad, rests on staying true to principles Southgate has introduced.These have been simple and refreshing. Do not pick players who are not fully fit. Do not pick players who are too old or too slow. Do not pick players who cannot actually pass the ball, who receive possession in the traditional state of panic, as though the ball is a terrible source of shame, the severed head tossed into your lap by some passing Colonel Kurtz to be juggled on your knee and then hurled away with a sneeze of tears.Southgate’s style demands an easy facility playing the ball out from the back. Hence the absence of Smalling this year, a fine footballer who has made the most of his talents but who was hardly renowned as a silky ball-player even in his Maidstone United days.Any marginal call at defence or goalkeeper should be decided in similar footballing fashion. Joe Hart may be a great tourist but, if he is not playing for West Ham and is poor with the ball at his feet, it is hard to see a convincing reason for picking him ahead of Nick Pope.Similarly Jack Wilshere may have a fine passing range but he lacks the strength or mobility to keep that high-tick England midfield going, a place where Southgate needs fit, powerful runners.Ruben Loftus -Cheek also has his issues with stamina. But he is a modern, powerful footballer who offers the ability to ghost past an opponent in the clinches. Similarly the athletic Alexander‑Arnold must surely go to Russia having made it to Kiev with Liverpool, where he may even play in midfield given the power of Real Madrid’s left flank.One other suggestion: Ryan Sessegnon has played a full season in a patient, technically skilled Fulham team and has further picked up the Southgate vibes in the England Under-21s. The 17‑year‑old could have been an excellent surprise pick.Beyond this there is a feeling that any kind of change is a good change. The lack of churn in successive squads has been a factor in the lassitude around England and tournament football. As it stands England’s 2018 World Cup squad could contain nine members of the Brazil 2014 lot that exited the tournament in six days; and a massive 16 members of the Euro 2016 squad who exited over 90 minutes of public disintegration against Iceland in Nice, a day when England hated the ball, hated the grass, hated their own feet.Under Southgate England do at least get the point that international football is a test of systems, that it is necessary to stick to some kind of blueprint for how you want your football to look and feel rather than simply finagling together the usual odd-lot of star players and injured parts and hoping passion and pride and being England will make the difference.Southgate is limited in his choices. But he can make a statement by trimming the edges the right way, by selecting without favour and by refusing to blink at the last when his own vision of steady, high-energy passing football is finally close to the main stage."

“We are Real Madrid,” Marcelo said boldly after Real Madrid had – just – held off Juventus’s fightback in the quarter-final. The reference was clear: they were not Barcelona, not the sort of team to go giving away three-goal leads as their great rivals had against Roma the previous night, not the sort of side who countenanced failure. Whether that is arrogance or a necessary mindset for winning probably depends on perspective, but what is true of that Madrid is that their most obvious quality is simply that they win. Inexplicably at times, but remorselessly.Madrid are only the fourth side to have been European champions three times in a row. Only they themselves, between 1956 and 1960, have had a run of sustained success better than the four Champions Leagues they have won in the past five years. That suggests they are one of the greatest teams in history and yet it really doesn’t feel like it.Perhaps the issue is one of proximity, that being so close means their flaws stand out and time will provide the perspective that allows their achievements properly to be measured. And yet there was no such issue with Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona, whose 2011 triumph confirmed the greatness they had touched in 2009 and come so close to repeating in 2010.“In 10 years I don’t think anybody will speak about how we lost,” Jürgen Klopp said on Saturday night, and perhaps that is the real issue with perspective. There is an assumption that a club that keeps winning must be great and the precise details fade away. Saturday’s success, after all, was the result of a bizarre concatenation of freakish circumstance: a brilliant overhead kick, two hideous goalkeeping errors and an injury to the opposition’s best player.But what’s really bizarre is how frequently similar circumstances have occurred this season. Sven Ulreich’s mistake that ultimately settled the semi-final against Bayern seemed like an error for the ages. A game and a half later, it was battling to stay on the podium for worst mistake made against Real Madrid by a goalkeeper in the Champions League this season. Add in penalties given and not given, against Juve and Bayern, and it’s pretty clear that a lot of key moments have fallen Madrid’s way this season. Whether you think that is a matter of luck or of the winning mentality of which Marcelo spoke probably depends on who you support.The dissonance comes when Madrid’s Champions League record is compared to their record in the domestic league. In those last five seasons they have won the domestic title only once. That makes little sense: how can a team that dominates in Europe not dominate at home?And yet none of those other sides who won three titles in a row also won their domestic league in each of those three seasons. Madrid’s five in-a-row champions of the late 50s won the league only twice in that spell. Ajax won only two between 1971 and 1973. Bayern won only one between 1974 and 1976 – and finished as low as 10th in the Bundesliga in 1975. Perhaps this is simply the smoothing effect of time: Bayern, certainly, could easily have lost the 1975 final against Leeds and the 1976 final against St-Étienne.In a sense, of course, this is, anyway, not comparing like with like. The competition is very different now to when those previous three three-time champions were contesting it. Then, limited to champions, it was harder to get into, but with only five rounds could be won with a couple of good performances. Now for the superclubs – with access to the last 16 and often the last eight all but guaranteed – the issue is peaking at the right time and having the decisiveness to win those key games in the spring.And greatness, anyway, perhaps is about more than mere trophies. As Arrigo Sacchi has always been very keen to point out, what matters in football, what is remembered, is not necessarily what is done, but what is done well. The Ajax of 1971-73, the Internazionale of 1964-65, the Barcelona of 2009-11, Sacchi’s Milan of 1989-90, they all took the game in new directions. They innovated, created new styles. They stood for something (and while that may have included a cynicism akin to Sergio Ramos’s, it certainly did not involve two of their biggest stars using their post-match interviews to agitate for moves).It’s not clear what exactly Madrid stand for. No philosophy, certainly, beyond having the money to sign lots of very good players. But they have that vital ruthlessness and in Zinedine Zidane a coach who, for all the doubts about him, has a habit of making decisive substitutions. Does that make them great? Perhaps in one sense it does, and such matters are probably necessarily subjective. But beyond the highly efficient accumulation of silverware, it would be hard to argue this Madrid have changed the game. They are, though, indisputably Real Madrid."
football,"Egypt should have Mohamed Salah fit for World Cup but either way Héctor Cúper sets the team up very defensivelyAhmad Yousef

This article is part of the Guardian’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.Egypt may have one of the best players in the world in Mohamed Salah but do not let that fool you – this is a team set up very defensively under Héctor Cúper. In his first 32 games as Egypt manager the Argentinian conceded only 18 goals. By mid-May he had yet to lose by more than one goal.While the nation holds its breath over the injury Salah suffered in the Champions League final, and the latest bulletins suggest he will be fine but may miss the opening game against Uruguay, Cúper has carried on with his preparations for the tournament. His defensive mindset is instilled into the squad and in his 4-2-3-1 lineup, with the two holding midfielders, Mohamed Elneny and Tarek Hamed, expected to sit deep.Meanwhile, the veteran goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary, who is expected to start, is not concerned by his age: “I am 45 years old and I can’t argue about that but, for me, this is just a number on a paper.”The defence will be made up of Mohamed Abdel-Shafy at left-back (or Karim Hafez if he has recovered from injury) with the two West Bromwich Albion defenders Ali Gabr and Ahmed Hegazi at centre-back and the versatile Ahmed Fathi at right-back.One of Egypt’s main weaknesses, which must be addressed before the World Cup, is the baffling manner in which they concede goals. Thirteen of those 18 goals let in under Cúper came from crosses, which seems remarkable for a side whose defensive partnership of Hegazi and Gabr has an average height of 1.95m and who are so often praised for their defensive acumen.Going forward Cúper prefers three attacking midfielders and one up front. Mahmoud Hassan “Trezeguet”, Abdallah El Said and Mohamed Salah will make up that triumvirate with Trezeguet hoping to emulate his club form at Kasimpasa, saying: “I hope to be able to reproduce the performances I have had here [in Turkey] at the World Cup. I want to help the national team as much as I can.”On the right side Egypt will rely heavily on Salah, who offers the pace, strength and goals they desperately need. The Liverpool forward will need to recover from his shoulder injury and focus on the football after an image rights dispute with the Egyptian FA unnerved him towards the end of the season.Said will pull the strings in central midfield and up front will be Ahmed Hassan “Koka”. His is a rather thankless task. The Braga striker has to close down the opponents’ defence, chase whatever long balls the defenders hoof towards him and try to hold up play so that he can either turn and shoot or, more likely, feed one of the attacking midfielders.Egypt may struggle to score many goals but teams will find it hard to break them down. In recent friendlies against Portugal and Greece the Pharaohs were tested against stronger opposition for the first time and, although they lost, the scorelines of 2-1 and 1-0 showed that they have the grit and determination to test even the best sides.Probable starting XIWhich player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup?Kasimpasa’s Mahmoud Hassan “Trezeguet”, named after David Trezeguet for his slight resemblance to the former France striker, has impressed in his first season in Turkey, on loan from Anderlecht. The winger had, by mid-May, amassed 13 goals and six assists in his first season and could be the one who steps up to make people realise that Egypt are not just Salah.Which player is likely to disappoint?Mohamed Elneny’s form had been picking up in the second half of the season and his excellent performances for Arsenal earned him a long-term contract extension in March but then he suffered an ankle injury. He will be back for the World Cup but may lack match fitness.What is the realistic aim for Egypt at the World Cup and why?Egypt fans will be hoping that Salah is fully fit and that his scintillating performances this season can inspire the rest of a rather lacklustre team to make it out of a group also featuring Uruguay, Russia and Saudi Arabia. The perception in Egypt is that the Pharaohs have the ability to reach the last 16 and anything less would be a disappointment. “Uruguay are the best team but after that we can all fight for second place and, if someone thinks otherwise, I will be ready to listen to their arguments in my office,” Héctor Cúper said recently.Ahmad Yousef writers for Kingfut.com.Follow him on Twitter here.

Antonio Conte has pointed to the departure of Michael Emenalo as Chelsea’s technical director in the autumn as a key moment in a difficult campaign, as the Italian prepares for what could be his final league game in charge of the club.Emenalo, one of Roman Abramovich’s most trusted lieutenants, ended a 10-year association with Chelsea in early November despite the owner having personally attempted to persuade him to stay on. The former Nigeria defender had cited a desire to spend more time with his young family, although, as it transpired, he would take up a similar position at the then French champions Monaco a little over three weeks later.Conte had benefited from Emenalo, a calm voice in an emotional boardroom, as a conduit between coaching staff and club hierarchy, and, while the head coach’s frustrations over recruitment policy over the summer had been perceived as criticisms of the technical director, the tensions had eased in their relationship by the time of his departure.“To lose Michael, it was a big loss for us, yes,” said the Italian, whose team travel to Newcastle on Sunday with only slim hopes of securing a top‑four finish. “I think so, I think so. Also because Michael did a great job for this club for many years. Last season he helped me a lot during the season. This season, until he left, he helped me a lot. I remember very well he left just after the Manchester United game … For me, for sure, it was a big loss in November.”Chelsea, who spent around £50m in the January transfer window on three new players, are still determining whether or not to replace Emenalo directly or dilute the role’s duties, many of which are now being overseen by the influential director Marina Granovskaia. Informal talks have taken place with some prospective candidates for the position but the situation will be formally addressed only in the summer.Asked whether appointing a new technical director should be made a matter of urgency, Conte said: “But this is not my decision. As you know very well, my task is to work very hard. This is not my decision. This is the decision for others. I’m not in a position to say [whether an expert in that field should be hired].”Chelsea must win on Tyneside and hope Liverpool lose at home to Brighton if they are to qualify for next season’s Champions League and Conte is expected to depart, regardless, after the team’s appearance in the FA Cup final on Saturday. The Italian intends to return to Milan for Andrea Pirlo’s testimonial game on 21 May having made clear he has not, as yet, been asked to attend any meetings with his club immediately after the conclusion of the domestic season.Thibaut Courtois, absent for Wednesday’s 1-1 draw with Huddersfield, is expected to be fit. Olivier Giroud and Eden Hazard are among those likely to be restored to the starting lineup but the defenders David Luiz (knee) and Ethan Ampadu (ankle) are out."

What distinguished Roberto Firmino in the eyes of Hemerson Maria were not two overhead kicks the 17-year-old scored against his Figueirense team, although they convinced the coach to sanction the teenager’s transfer from Clube de Regatas Brasil (CRB) on first sight. It was a conversation they shared several months later when he found Firmino alone, almost 2,000 miles from home and refusing to go back to Maceió.“We had played a state league game, under-17s, and afterwards there was a recess, I think one week or more without any activities,” he recalls. “All my players travelled to be with their family, except Firmino. I remember that he was alone in Florianopolis. His parents had stayed living in Maceió. The last time Firmino had seen them was seven months earlier but he decided to stay in Florianopolis. He said to me: ‘I want to stay here. I need to practice more, I don’t want to lose time. I will stop only after I make something good with my life.’ I was surprised. He is shy but he has a strong personality and mentality. He knows what he wants in his career and his life.”Firmino’s father, José Roberto Cordeiro, was a hawker on the streets of Maceió when his son started with CRB. When José went to a game at CRB, the club he supported, it was not to watch Firmino but to sell beer, water and soft drinks outside. He could not afford a ticket. A decade later there is a ticket with José Roberto Cordeiro’s name on. It is for Saturday’s Champions League final at NSC Olimpiyskiy Stadium in Kiev. VIP section. His son, central to Liverpool’s hopes of defeating Real Madrid, has made something good with his life.Behind the flamboyant dress sense, the bling, the maverick goal celebrations and the no-look finishes there appears a radically different side to the centre-forward. Shy. Quiet. Introverted. The words crop up whenever those who have been part of the 26-year-old’s career are asked to describe him. Or at least from those who will describe him. Firmino asked his immediate family and closest friends to politely decline interviews in the buildup to a final that demands singular focus. Nothing can get in the way of his dream. It has always been that way.Nene Zini, an agent for Firmino, explains: “When he moved to Hoffenheim [aged 19] I asked him twice about how it was going, if he liked the city, the country, the new life. He was living alone, no family were with him there. I was concerned but he said he hadn’t any problems. But I didn’t feel confident so I said: ‘My job is to help you. Whatever you need, tell me. I will do everything for you.’ And Firmino replied: ‘No worries. I am fine. If I wasn’t happy I would have left the club and the country.’ I didn’t understand him then but I understand now. He is shy, a man of few words, but he has a strong personality.”The Brazil international, selected for the World Cup following an outstanding season, is “a footballer from his head to his toes” in the words of Jürgen Klopp. There is no greater champion of Firmino than the Liverpool manager. “I order a song for Bobby!” Klopp told LFCTV this week. To him, songs for Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané but only a chant for the conductor of Liverpool’s devastating attacks makes little sense.It suits Firmino, however, to have Salah taking the spotlight. He revels in his selfless role even though, as the PFA Premier League team of the season testified, with Firmino absent, his influence can be overlooked outside Anfield. “This constant discussion about whether he’s undervalued or whatever in public,” said Klopp. “This never happened for one second either in the club or in the team.” Thierry Henry, a sound and independent judge, described Firmino as “the most complete striker in the league”. It is an education to track his movement and work-rate through a game, albeit also a struggle to focus on one player given the range of threats in Klopp’s attack.No Liverpool player covered more ground in the Premier League than Firmino. His total of 347.7km is remarkable for a forward and underlines his importance to Klopp’s system and the manager’s reluctance to withdraw him even with a comfortable lead. He covered, on average, 11.3km per game.No Liverpool player made more sprints in the Premier League. With 2,353, Firmino comfortably eclipsed Salah in second place by 366 and averaged 76.3 sprints every 90 minutes. No Liverpool forward made more interceptions than Firmino, his 18 double the amount made by Mané in second. Salah made five.Firmino’s 15 goals and seven assists in the league played a major part in Liverpool qualifying for the Champions League. In Europe, however, Firmino’s influence and end product have been arguably greater. With 10 goals – 11 when the one against Hoffenheim in the qualifier is included – he and Salah have scored more in a single European campaign than any other player in Liverpool’s European history. Firmino has also provided seven assists, giving him direct involvement in 42.5% of the record 40 goals Liverpool have scored from the group stage onwards. “This is my best year as a professional footballer,” he reflected last week.It started very differently. Hemerson Maria, coach of Vila Nova in Brazil, explains: “When we started to work together at Figueirense I called Roberto ‘Alberto’ for two weeks. All the time I shouted ‘Alberto, Alberto, Alberto’ and he never corrected me. I said Alberto and he listened and obeyed the instructions. After two weeks my colleague asked me: ‘Why are you calling Roberto as Alberto? His name is Roberto, Roberto Firmino’. I didn’t know! I asked Roberto why he never said the correct name to me. But he is very shy and said: ‘It’s fine teacher, no worries.’”He may be more forceful when reminding Madrid of his name in Kiev.Additional reporting by Thiago Rabelo"

Mikel Arteta is the strong favourite to succeed Arsène Wenger as manager at Arsenal, with productive talks having progressed between his camp and the club.Conversations are so advanced that Arteta is giving thought to the people he might want in his backroom team. It is unclear whether Steve Bould would stay, with Wenger’s assistant not always seeing eye to eye with Arteta when they were together at Arsenal.The club have considered the merits of a number of managers, including Max Allegri, but the current Juventus manager wants greater control over budgets and recruitment for the next cycle of his career. Those demands do not match the Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis’s vision for the job and Allegri is understood to be leaning towards staying in Turin.Arteta would be happy to take a job more akin to that of a head coach. That would not compromise the structure put in place by Gazidis. Last November the club appointed Dortmund’s Sven Mislintat and Barcelona’s Raul Sanllehi as head of recruitment and football relations respectively.Arteta, a former Arsenal captain who played for the club from 2011 to 2016, has been working as a coach at Manchester City under Pep Guardiola since July 2016. City’s manager has said he would not stand in Arteta’s way if Arsenal come calling.“If he decides to move because he has this offer, this option, I will not say you don’t have to go,” Guardiola said. “I want the best for my friends and he’s a friend of mine. If he decides to go, I will be so sad but I will understand his decision, because it’s his career, his life, his family.”"

Manchester City have held discussions with Raheem Sterling regarding a new contract, though the expectation is an agreement will not be reached until after the World Cup.It is understood a meeting was held with Sterling’s representatives at the end of last month. With the forward set to be named in Gareth Southgate’s England World Cup squad, talks may not resume before July.Sterling, who joined City from Liverpool for £44m in the summer of 2015, earns about £170,000 a week on a deal that has two years remaining. The forward is seeking to be one of the champions’ best-paid players and can expect a rise to his basic weekly salary of at least £50,000.City are intent on rewarding the 22-year-old for the most impressive season of his career in which he has scored 23 goals and been a key factor in City winning the title with five matches to spare.Pep Guardiola said: “The club, the chairman [Khaldoon al-Mubarak] and myself want him to stay a long time, renew his contract but we are going on holiday in a few days.”Guardiola also expects Sergio Agüero to stay, though he could not be unequivocal. Asked whether the striker may leave the manager said: “I think it’s not going to happen. My desire is it will not happen but I don’t know … Sergio is going to stay until he decides his time is over.”Brahim Díaz and Phil Foden have each made four Premier League appearances so need to make a fifth in Sunday’s final match at Southampton to get a winner’s medal. “I didn’t know it but, all respect, it looks ridiculous to me,” Guardiola said of the rule. “If they want my medal I will give them the medal. They are champions – they worked from day one to the last one, training with us, in the locker room.”"

Mauricio Pochettino has signed a new five-year contract at Tottenham Hotspur worth up to £8.5m each year. The manager had refused in recent weeks to guarantee he would lead the club into their new stadium in September and he sparked alarm on the final day of the season when he appeared to suggest that his future was linked to how Daniel Levy approached the summer transfer window.Pochettino called upon the chairman to “be brave and take risks” and it was clear that the Argentinian, who has led Spurs to three successive top-three finishes and Champions League qualifications, was positioning, at the very least, to win certain concessions. Pochettino has worked effectively on relatively meagre budgets during his four seasons at the club and is determined to strengthen the squad in order to challenge for major trophies.However, he is well aware that because of the financing requirements of the stadium – a further £500m, at the very least, must be found – he is likely to have to continue to balance signings with outgoings. When he delivered his end-of-season message and talked of the need to “create a new project”, he was trying to get swift decisions over player sales to gain more flexibility on his signings.Pochettino is willing to listen to offers for Mousa Dembélé, Danny Rose and Toby Alderweireld – the last of those is a target for Manchester United’s José Mourinho. He was also seeking to mark his turf over the type of player he wants to sign. Typically, Levy has preferred younger ones with resale value but the manager would like him to consider more seasoned professionals.Pochettino and Levy have since held positive talks regarding the club’s direction and the announcement that the manager has agreed to fresh terms could not be better timed. Pochettino has been linked with Real Madrid, where the future of Zinedine Zidane could come into sharp focus after Saturday’s Champions League final against Liverpool in Kiev.Tottenham hope that Pochettino’s commitment will encourage some of their big-name players to extend their contracts. Negotiations are planned with Jan Vertonghen, Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Hugo Lloris and Christian Eriksen. Pochettino’s coaches, Jesús Pérez, Miguel D’Agostino and Toni Jiménez, have also extended their deals until 2023.Pochettino said: “I am honoured to have signed a new long-term contract as we approach one of the most significant periods in the club’s history, and be the manager that will lead this team into our new world-class stadium. This is just one of the factors that makes this one of the most exciting jobs in world football and we are already making plans to ensure we continue to build on the great work that everyone has contributed to over the past four years.“Daniel and I have spoken at length about our aspirations for this football club. We both share the same philosophies to achieve long-term, sustainable success. This is a special club – we always strive to be creative in the way we work both on and off the pitch and will continue to stick to our principles in order to achieve the success this club deserves.”"

Aston Villa are confident John Terry will sign a new contract if they win promotion to the Premier League and are willing to reach an agreement with the 37-year-old that would allow him to miss both games against Chelsea to help facilitate any deal.Terry signed a lucrative one-year contract with Villa last July and revealed at the time that he had turned down offers to remain in the Premier League because he did not want to face Chelsea, where he made 717 appearances across 22 years. Within Terry’s deal there is a clause that entitles him to a new 12-month contract if Villa are promoted – they face Fulham in Saturday’s Championship play-off final – as well as a substantial bonus.Villa firmly believe that Terry, who has started 32 league games this season, will want to stay if they return to the top flight and they are prepared to remove any possibility of the fixtures against Chelsea being an issue. Although Steve Bruce’s response to that potential problem was slightly tongue-in-cheek, it is understood that Villa would agree to Terry missing the Chelsea matches if need be.Asked whether it was certain that Terry would stay if Villa defeat Fulham, Bruce, the manager, replied: “Well, we’ll not pick him against Chelsea if that’s what he wants. I really genuinely hope he triggers it. All those phone calls to him, he hasn’t been disappointed with it. You can’t be disappointed when you walk through here.”Bruce said that Terry had been a huge influence at Villa on and off the field. “I just knew what he would give. Let’s be fair, he has been one of the great defenders of our country. He is a great leader of men, which we don’t produce many of any more, and in a quiet way; he is not a ranter and a raver, he is not one who puts heads through doors. He is calm. People like [Jack] Grealish have looked up to him and thought: ‘Is that the way I’ve got to be to be a top player?’”Bruce’s opposite number on Saturday, Slavisa Jokanovic, has said he intends to pressurise Terry and James Chester and expects the pair to make mistakes. “Experience in life is important but it’s not everything,” Fulham’s manager said. “When you talk about experience you are talking about the past. John Terry is a fantastic player, so is James Chester. They have experience playing in this stadium. But probably they cannot be in their best level right now.“We are the youngest team, the team with more energy. We believe in our style. We believe we can dominate the situation. We are going to try to put against Terry some fast and some stronger players. I expect he can make some difference in our favour. He plays in a complicated position. All of us can make mistakes and I expect some mistakes from his side.”Jokanovic responded to rumours of interest in him from Chelsea by saying: “I have a contract and that’s it. I am not thinking about the future. This game is so huge I don’t know what I am going to do on Sunday morning.”"

Lucien Favre has been confirmed as the new manager of Borussia Dortmund, taking the 60-year-old Swiss from French Ligue 1 club Nice with a two-year contract.Dortmund parted ways with Peter Stöger at the end of last season after they finished in fourth place, only just qualifying for the Champions League. His departure ended an inconsistent campaign that began with the Dutchman Peter Bosz in charge before he was sacked midway through the season.Favre left Nice, who finished eighth, two days ago and will return to the Bundesliga following successful spells at Hertha Berlin and Borussia Mönchengladbach. He led Hertha to a fourth-place finish in 2009 and then took Gladbach from the brink of relegation to fourth spot in 2012.“Signing Lucien Favre as coach is an important part of our sporting new start,” said Dortmund’s sporting director, Michael Zorc. “He is well-respected for his qualities which he has impressively proven at Hertha, Gladbach and recently Nice.”Dortmund, Bundesliga champions in 2011 and 2012, had expected to be contend for the title in the 2017-18 campaign but instead saw Bayern Munich once again become runaway champions. “To coach Borussia Dortmund is an attractive task that I am very happy to take on,” said Favre. “Now we will start working on the new team.”"

Liverpool are growing concerned that Rhian Brewster may become the latest young English talent to move to the Bundesliga this summer with the highly rated striker yet to sign a professional contract at Anfield.Brewster has been eligible to sign professional terms with Liverpool since turning 18 on 1 April but remains on the scholarship deal he agreed when arriving from Chelsea in 2015. Liverpool have so far been unable to convince the teenager to commit to a lucrative deal, despite regular encouragement from manager Jürgen Klopp, who considers Brewster a first team option for next season, and fear he may be tempted by a move to Germany.RB Leipzig and Borussia Dortmund have been linked with the England Under-17 international, who won the Golden Boot in the team’s World Cup triumph in October, but Borussia Mönchengladbach are expected to lead the race for his signature. Mönchengladbach signed Mandela Egbo from Crystal Palace in 2015 while Jadon Sancho, Reece Oxford and Ademola Lookman have all taken first team opportunities in the Bundesliga recently. Liverpool would only be entitled to a compensation fee set by a tribunal should Brewster leave while on scholarship terms, although Anfield officials are continuing efforts to conclude a deal with his representatives.Klopp, meanwhile, insists Liverpool deserve to qualify for next season’s Champions League given their efforts throughout this campaign. Liverpool have been permanent residents in the top four since 17 December but need a point at home to Brighton to secure qualification for a second successive season.The Liverpool manager said: “We absolutely deserve it, 100%, but we have to make the last step. If we don’t do it and Chelsea get the spot then they deserve it. It is as simple as that. But over the whole season the boys did it in the most difficult circumstances. Chelsea made five or six changes (against Huddersfield) in midweek. That would not be possible for us even if we thought about it. These boys have had to fight for each yard, the last six or seven weeks, pretty much the same group. I really think they deserve it but we have to make the final step ourselves because nobody will probably help us.”"

There was a funereal feel about this fixture as Stoke, who were already relegated, condemned Swansea to spending next season in the Championship alongside them. Swansea, in truth, were resigned to their fate on Wednesday night, after Huddersfield grabbed an unlikely point at Chelsea, meaning that Carlos Carvalhal’s side needed a footballing miracle on the final day of the season to survive. That never looked like materialising as Swansea’s seven-year stay in the Premier League ended in defeat and amid no little anger in the stands.Huw Jenkins was not at the game but his name was sung frequently and not in a complimentary way as the supporters directed their frustration at the chairman and the board. “You greedy bastards, get out of our club”, “We want our club back”, and “We want Jenkins out” all got an airing as the exasperation that has been simmering away for so long bubbled over.In that respect the action on the pitch felt like a sideshow at times, especially given that it was never remotely likely that Swansea would win, Southampton would lose and there would be a 10-goal swing in the process – the set of circumstances that Carvalhal’s team needed to preserve their Premier League status.Even the first part of that equation – a home victory – proved beyond Swansea as they succumbed to their 21st league defeat of a miserable season, despite taking the lead through Andy King’s early goal and registering 26 shots on a day when Leon Britton and Ángel Rangel, two club stalwarts, made their final appearances before retiring. One of those efforts on goal was struck by André Ayew and it rather summed up Swansea’s season when Tammy Abraham, on as a second-half substitute, got in the way of the ball and prevented it from going into the net, with Jack Butland, Stoke’s goalkeeper, beaten.It was a surreal afternoon in so many ways – at one point Stoke’s supporters were chanting for Swansea to score 10, such was their desire to see Mark Hughes, their former manager, relegated with Southampton – and topped off by the sight of Carvalhal reading statistics off a sheet of paper afterwards, saying nothing remotely critical about his own reign and even suggesting that he could still be Swansea’s manager next season. “They [the owners] ask me if I am available to talk about staying,” Carvalhal said.It felt like a strange comment for Carvalhal to make, not least because it flies in the face of what senior figures at the club think should happen as Swansea approach the huge task of trying to rebuild for the Championship, and it was hard to escape the feeling that the Portuguese was doing little more than saving face prior to his anticipated exit.Either way, Carvalhal had clearly done his homework before coming into the press conference room afterwards. “We had 18 games, we achieved 20 points since our arrival. We achieved more points in this period than Stoke City, Southampton, Huddersfield, West Brom, Watford and Brighton, and the same points as Leicester,” he said, looking down at his facts and figures. “I don’t want to criticise anybody but it’s a fact that the few points the team did in the first 20 games, with just 13 points, made things very difficult to recover.”That may well be so and it would be extremely unfair to pin relegation on Carvalhal given the wider problems at the club and the mess that he inherited when he was appointed in December, yet there is also no getting away from the fact that Swansea imploded at a time when they had Premier League survival in their hands. Swansea, 13th at the start of March, failed to win any of their last nine league games – something that Carvalhal attributed, rather dubiously, to the team’s element of “surprise disappearing”.Stoke, who avoided the ignominy of finishing bottom with this victory, also have a busy summer ahead and it remains to be seen whether Lambert will stay in charge. Badou Ndiaye’s neat finish and Peter Crouch’s close-range header gave Paul Lambert only his second victory in 15 matches, with the Stoke manager claiming afterwards he had been working in difficult circumstances because of the behaviour of a small of group of senior players whom he felt that he had no choice but to alienate. “Anyone that knows me knows I’m fair but my standards are high, and I wouldn’t have accepted that anywhere,” Lambert said."

Andrés Iniesta has signed for the Japanese side Vissel Kobe after bringing down the curtain on his brilliant Barcelona career.The 34-year-old midfielder appeared before a packed news conference at a central Tokyo hotel on Thursday along with Kobe’s billionaire owner, Hiroshi Mikitani.“I’m pleased to announce,” Mikitani said, “that Andrés Iniesta will be signing up play with Vissel Kobe after his historic career at Barcelona.”Iniesta signed his contract as Mikitani watched, and then spoke through an interpreter. Terms of the contract were not disclosed but Japanese media are reporting he will earn $30m (£22.5m) annually on a three-year deal.“For me this is a very special day,” the Spaniard said. “This is an important challenge for me. My family is excited to come to Japan and we are very pleased. There were many offers. Other clubs showed interest. But I decided to sign with Vissel Kobe because the project presented to me was impressive.”Mikitani is also the CEO of the Barcelona sponsor Rakuten, a Japanese online retailer.Iniesta held up the team’s red shirt with his famous No 8 on the back and his name written across the bottom. The Spaniard is expected to retire from international football after this summer’s World Cup.Iniesta scored the winning goal for Spain in the 2010 World Cup final. He also was a key part of Spain’s two European Championship wins, in 2008 and 2012.He announced last month he would leave Barcelona after 16 seasons. His last match for the Spanish club was on Sunday against Real Sociedad at the Camp Nou.Vissel Kobe are sixth in the J-League after 15 games. They signed Lukas Podolski last year but the German striker is out until the end of June with an injured calf."

The official 2018 World Cup anthem – Live It Up, by reggaeton star Nicky Jam, dancehall singer Era Istrefi, and polite fast-talker Will Smith – was released at the weekend, and met by the worlds of football and music with thundering indifference ... just as committee-approved pop, designed to please everybody but satisfying no one, always should be. File alongside spirit-sapping efforts such as R Kelly’s Sign Of A Victory, Ricky Martin’s Cup of Life, and Anastacia’s admittedly memorable Sepp’s Gonna Sexx Ya Up.Still, at least Fifa are trying. England don’t bother any more, which is a terrible shame, as for a while they’d been world leaders in the field. Spin back to 1965 when the FA commissioned over-the-brow skiffle legend Lonnie Donegan to write a song for their upcoming tournament. He introduced us to World Cup Willie, tough as a lion, who never will give up. “That’s why Willie is favourite for the Cup!” The trad-jazz swinger wasn’t Lonnie’s best, but he did record the definitive version of Rock Island Line, and without his influence you’re getting no Beatles, so he had plenty of credit in the bank. Also England lifted the trophy with this ringing in their lugs, and there’s no arguing with results.Five years on, Sir Alf Ramsey’s squad reached the toppermost of the poppermost with Back Home. Penned by Bill Martin and Phil Coulter, the men behind Sandie Shaw’s 1967 Eurovision winner Puppet on a String and Cliff’s 1968 near-miss Congratulations, it was a catchy but emotional paean to across-the-sea yearning. Hipsters in search of deep cuts are advised to flip the single over for Cinnamon Stick, a bubblegum love song sprinkled with dreamy summer harmonies, Nobby the spiritual successor to Harry Nilsson, Big Jack channelling his inner Mama Cass. Totally Mexico.By the time England got to No 1 again with World in Motion, John Barnes was shouldering the creative burden on his own, the art of 1990 imitating the life of 1986. His daisy-age-inflected rap is commonly regarded as the 31-second pinnacle of the genre: from this point onwards, World Cup singles would never be as good again. (Neither would New Order or Barnes himself, but that’s for another day.) Embrace? James Corden? A supergroup starring members of Space and Ocean Colour Scene? No thanks! No thank you! No thanks!If 1990 represented England’s artistic peak, then 1982 was the year the squad was most prolific. Ron’s 22 were on their way to their first World Cup in a dozen years; all that pent-up frustration burst the creative dam. A double A-side was issued. England, We’ll Fly The Flag was a patriotic reworking of a 1975 advertising jingle for British Airways composed by Jake Holmes, who was getting used to having his work adapted for bespoke purposes. In 1967 he wrote Dazed and Confused, a song which “inspired” Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin to fashion his own version.John Barnes' daisy-age-inflected rap is regarded as England's World Cup musical pinnacleOn the other side: the more popular This Time (We’ll Get It Right), penned by a couple of chaps from 1970s soft-rockers and future Roy Chubby Brown enablers Smokie. This Time is identical to tracks such as Layla, How Soon Is Now and Smells Like Teen Spirit, in so much as it’s recognisable from the very first note. That takes some doing, although while the aforementioned rock classics instantly whisk the listener away on a transcendent spiritual journey, the synthesised pipes of This Time succeed only in plummeting supporters of a certain generation into an unwelcome Pavlovian funk, a reminder of childhood promises made and broken. And that three minutes of turgid oompah stomp is coming right up.The single reached No 2, no mean feat given 1982 was a great year for pop, forcing England to elbow for position near the top of the chart alongside big hitters such as ABC, Joan Jett, Simple Minds, and the Scotland squad featuring John Gordon Sinclair. For the record, Dana and Northern Ireland’s magnificent Yer Man – “Well times have been tough / Now it’s time to do our stuff!” - failed to bother the top 10.It was followed by a long player, This Time: The Album (K-Tel), which contained several seminal performances: Glenn Hoddle taking on Queen’s We Are The Champions in a note-straining style later popularised by Alan Partridge’s rendition of Close To You; Viv Anderson and Trevor Francis running through You’ll Never Walk Alone, the melody line spoken with much feeling, like Elvis delivering the last stanza of Are You Lonesome Tonight; and a narration by Ray Clemence, The Road to Spain, which served only to emphasise how fortunate England had been to scrape into the finals, and concluded with this rousing call to arms: “I know that we didn’t qualify in the way we would have liked, but hopefully that’s in the past.” Throw in singalongs of Land of Hope and Glory, Abide With Me and God Save The Queen so bombastic that even Jacob Rees-Mogg might suggest moving the sliders on the mixing desk down a notch or two, and K-Tel had a number-37 sized hit on their hands. England went home from that tournament unbeaten. Eagle-eyed readers will have noted that whenever they put some effort into a song, they end up doing OK. This doesn’t augur well for the summer."

Being a parent isn’t easy. Over time you just hope you can pass on as many of your own flaws and prejudices, minimise the chances your children might become better, kinder human beings, and trust they can instead spend their lives staring at screens, leaving things on the floor and responding to attempts at conversation with remarks like, “Mmm. He’s doing one of his funnies”.I think that was the idea anyway. Looking back, the original instructions seem quite vague. It could have been the other way round. Passing on the virtues. Eliminating something else. Who knows. Just, so very tired.Now and then, however, you do get a helpful nudge along the way, an accidental hand-me-down from some kindly source. It was a moment of proximity to Yaya Touré that helped my eldest son get a first proper bite from football, the kind that stays and sticks, for better or worse, like a low-level dose of flu.We went to watch Fulham play Manchester City, as an experimental first live game in one of London’s milder grounds. The opening 20 minutes passed in a state of slight unrest, adjusting to the scale and the noise . Eventually City won a free-kick close to goal.Enter Yaya, pacing out an improbably weird run-up parallel to the 18-yard line, as though trying to sneak up on the ball from out of its eyeline. Finally he came gliding in at his right angle and spanked a dipping white blur into the net, the ball bouncing down with a thrilling thunk off the underside of the bar, directed by a supercharged sweet-spot hidden somewhere close to Touré’s ankle.There was a hush, followed by a bellow of outraged joy. And that was pretty much that. Football was set fair, implanted in that moment of refined geometry. The eldest still mentions it now and then. Goals have been “almost as good as Yaya’s free-kick”.But then the first little hit always stays with you in some form. Glenn Hoddle may pop up behind the TV punditry plinth looking like a charismatic celebrity pension-salesman of the 1980s, now eager to interest you in his successful nine-step personal development plan. But if you witnessed Peak Hod at an impressionable age, he remains just a god-like football genius who floats above such earthly concerns as making sense or not seeming weird.With any luck the Yaya-ometer, the idea of judging all midfielders on a scale of one to Touré, might just stick around too. As perhaps it should in the wider world, where his City farewell was marked this week by a ripple of polite, slightly distant applauses.Touré’s last game at the Etihad Stadium ended with a fond in-house ceremony featuring surprise star guest Kolo Touré, who came striding out across the grass in wing collar and no tie like a handsome spy at a polo match. But even in Kolo’s eulogy there was something oddly defiant, a need to insist on the scope and scale of his brother’s status.Which is odd, given the fact Touré was, in his three-season pomp, the most devastatingly influential midfielder in the past decade of the Premier League. Plus, of course, he was City’s Eric Cantona, the decisive nudge into a trophy-hungry machine. Touré has been the notable constant during the winning span of the wonder years, even that free-kick at Fulham one of 24 goals in English football in a title-winning season.And yet his influence has been easy to gloss. In the pub-talk punditry roll-call of great midfielders he is often an afterthought, with a tendency to see just the marauding war machine, those moments where he clanks forward like an iron giant, looming above the horizon with a tractor in each hand.Touré at his best had everything. For two years he was among the top three passers in Europe on the stats, with an ability to dictate the short rhythms, to find the longer pass, to sit and conduct the game from his deeper position.There were moments of wonderful craft, notably the decisive takedown of one early David Moyes Manchester United midfield, where instead of seeking out the expected collisions, Touré simply skirted around Marouane Fellaini, trusting the old boxing truism that a good big ’un will always beat a slow, confused Belgian.He became Kevin De Bruyne before Kevin De Bruyne was Kevin De Bruyne, the acme of the driving, scoring, passing midfielder. This isn’t an idle comparison. De Bruyne has 21 goals and 42 assists in 97 City games. In his three peak seasons, Touré dished up 36 goals and 15 assists in the same number of games.Perhaps Touré suffered a little because of City’s status, an emblem of success dished up as of right. But even this ignores his own extraordinary outsider’s story, the trek from youth football in Côte d’Ivoire, the seven years spent wandering the earth looking for a way in.As City evolve again, reconditioned into something beautiful and seductive by the supreme publicity coup of appointing Pep Guardiola, it is worth remembering Yaya, who provided his own galvanising force of personality, who sometimes can be difficult (Yaya wants a cake: just give him a cake) but who looks now like an all-star who has perhaps been a little undervalued, his peak years strewn too lightly with flags and flowers."

The uncapped Liverpool teenager Trent Alexander-Arnold has been included in England’s squad for the summer’s World Cup after Gareth Southgate revealed a youthful 23-man party “which we can be excited about” for the tournament in Russia.The 19-year-old joins a squad with only 11 previous appearances at the finals and only five survivors from Roy Hodgson’s party who failed to emerge from the group stage in Brazil four years ago. Gary Cahill, recalled after his omission for the friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy in March, is one of that quintet and now finds himself the most experienced member of the travelling party with 58 caps. With an average age marginally over 26, this will be the third youngest squad selected by England for a World Cup.There are places for Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who was capped twice in November and enjoyed an impressive year on loan at Crystal Palace from Chelsea, and Manchester City’s Fabian Delph, whose last cap came in November 2015. Adam Lallana, who managed a solitary Premier League start for Liverpool all season and whose 16-minute cameo on the final afternoon represented a first involvement in six weeks, has only been selected among five standby players. As anticipated, there is no place for Joe Hart, Ryan Bertrand or Jack Wilshere, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joe Gomez are injured.“I believe this is a squad which we can be excited about,” said Southgate, who will welcome all but the contingent from the FA Cup finalists, Chelsea and Manchester United, and Liverpool, as Champions League finalists, to St George’s Park on Monday to begin preparations for Russia. “It is a young group but with some really important senior players, so I feel the balance of the squad is good, both in terms of its experience, its character and also the positional balance.“We have a lot of energy and athleticism in the team but players who are equally comfortable in possession of the ball and I think people can see the style of play we’ve been looking to develop. The selection process has been over months really, it’s not just been the last few weeks. We feel the team are improving and we want to continue that momentum.”Only in 1958 and 2006 did England travel to a World Cup with a younger squad and 11 of the 23 have fewer than 20 caps.Alexander-Arnold, who has made three appearances for the under-21s, had been invited to train with the senior squad in the buildup to the games against the Dutch and the Italians and has enjoyed an impressive season at Anfield. He has made the most of the absence through injury of Nathaniel Clyne and Gomez for long periods and played a key role in the Liverpool’s Champions League knockout victories over Manchester City and Roma.Southgate has monitored his progress closely. “The first call-up for Trent Alexander-Arnold is well deserved,” he said. “When we pick young players, it’s not just because they are young, it’s because their performances deserve it. We’ve also had a couple of injuries with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joe Gomez, which is a huge blow for them personally and disappointing for us.”Alexander-Arnold offers back-up to Kieran Trippier and Kyle Walker at right wing-back and could be utilised in midfield if required, having featured there for Liverpool. The teenager, along with his club-mate Jordan Henderson, will link up with the squad after the friendly with Nigeria next month, as Southgate is insistent his players enjoy a week’s break after the end of their club seasons. The Football Association’s medical staff are confident the knee injury sustained by Trippier, which sidelined him on the final day of the season, will not hamper him in Russia, and they will assess him again when he joins the squad with the squad.Southgate has spent time speaking to those players who did not make the final cut and while Wilshere has not played for his country since the Euro 2016 defeat to Iceland, there were difficult conversations with Bertrand and Hart, who had played significant parts in qualifying and would have expected to be involved.For the nation, by the nation. The #ThreeLions’ official @FIFAWorldCup squad announcement. pic.twitter.com/YecUWPUZfJ“Ryan and Joe have played a lot over the last two years, so they’re not decisions we took lightly,” the manager said. “I could’ve had easier conversations by keeping them involved. With Joe, we’ve got three other goalkeepers who have had very good seasons and the decision I was faced with was: ‘Do I keep Joe in and have experience around the group? Or give the three guys who have basically had a better season a chance?’ We felt the players all needed to be in on merit.“Ryan is also very unfortunate in that it’s probably one of the strongest positions we have. Ryan has had a decent season but I just felt the others were ahead of him. Both calls were really tough. They’re both good guys and have contributed a lot throughout qualification, so it wasn’t an enjoyable part of the job and I feel it’s important to acknowledge their contribution in getting us to Russia.”Neither has been included on the five-man standby list, with Lallana joined by Burnley’s Tom Heaton and James Tarkowski, Lewis Cook of Bournemouth and West Brom’s Jake Livermore. They will join the squad at the training camp next week in the hope an opportunity presents itself, with Lallana to be promoted to the 23 if any of the forward options succumbs to injury in the next few weeks.“History tells us that one of those standby players may end up in the squad, as it’s very unusual for us to get through the end of the season and our two preparation games without any issues,” Southgate said. “All of the guys on standby have been really professional in their approach to this. They recognise there’s still an opportunity and we’ve had a lot of conversations over a period of time about their situation.”Butland (Stoke), Pickford (Everton), Pope (Burnley)Jones (Man Utd), Cahill (Chelsea), Walker (Man City), Trippier (Tottenham), Rose (Tottenham), Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Young (Man Utd), Stones (Man City), Maguire (Leicester)Dier (Tottenham), Henderson (Liverpool), Delph (Man City), Loftus-Cheek (Chelsea), Lingard (Man Utd), Alli (Tottenham)Kane (Tottenham), Rashford (Man Utd), Vardy (Leicester), Sterling (Man City), Welbeck (Arsenal)"

Gianluigi Buffon made his emotional farewell to Juventus on Saturday, marking his 640th and last Serie A appearance for the club with another victory.Buffon, who announced on Thursday he would be ending his 17-year spell in Turin, helped the champions finish the season with a 2-1 win over relegated Verona.Juventus had already wrapped up a seventh successive title, so this game was an opportunity to pay tribute to their departing captain. The goalkeeper was already off the pitch by the time Verona got their consolation goal after Daniele Rugani and Miralem Pjanic had put the hosts in charge.Buffon left the pitch for the final time as a Juventus player after being substituted in the 63rd minute, embracing team-mates, staff and opponents alike as he made his way to the touchline. There were plenty of tears in the crowd as Juve supporters said goodbye to one of the finest goalkeepers the game has ever seen.The tears had been there at the start, too. Buffon was accompanied by his three sons as he led out the team at the Allianz Stadium and greeted emotional Juve supporters in the crowd before kick-off, the fans eager to say their own goodbyes to their departing idol.Massimiliano Allegri, the Juventus manager, paid tribute to departing goalkeeper. “Today it was right that Gigi Buffon was honoured for all he did, there was no better way to finish this year.”Messages had earlier poured in from his team-mates on social media, with Paulo Dybala writing: “100 games together, 1,040 days, smiles, tears, hugs. I wish you the happiest future, my captain. I will miss you – now let’s have fun together again!”Buffon, who has not announced his retirement amid “interesting proposals” from other clubs to extend his playing career, saw his team-mates struggle to break down Verona in the first half, with Dybala’s chip that hit the bar the closest.Rugani opened the scoring in the 49th minute, tapping home after Verona goalkeeper Nícolas parried Douglas Costa’s low effort. Pjanic made it two just three minutes later, whipping a fine free-kick into the left corner, with Nícolas left rooted to the spot.Buffon then made his exit, given a guard of honour as he made his way off the pitch, all corners of the stadium rising in appreciation. Carlo Pinsoglio replaced him and conceded in the 76th minute as Alessio Cerci pulled one back. It did not prove costly as the hosts closed out victory, but the day belonged to Buffon.Parma, Buffon’s first club, will return to Serie A next season three years after bankruptcy, after a 2-0 win at Spezia on Friday – and a late equaliser for Foggia against Frosinone – sealed a third successive promotion.The club won the Uefa Cup, European Cup Winners’ Cup and three Coppa Italias during their heyday of the 1990s and early 2000s, but had to start again in Serie D after going bankrupt in 2015.A reformed club, Parma Calcio 2013, easily secured promotion from Italy’s fourth tier in 2015-16 and won the Serie C promotion play-off the following year to reach Serie B this season.“I said I’d take Parma back to Serie A. I kept my promise,” the club captain Alessandro Lucarelli told Sky Sport Italia.“This is a journey we started three years ago in front of these amazing fans. We had difficult moments, we always got back on our feet. They never gave up and I am proud to have been their captain. It can’t be real, it’s impossible.”Frosinone were leading Foggia 2-1 with a minute remaining but conceded a last-gasp equaliser to hand Parma automatic promotion."

Robert Lowery emails in: “As a neutral, whose fellow Irish men give him a hard time, the apparently premeditated physical targeting by Fulham of Grealish should be irrelevant but it’s a reminder that there are more egregious sins against the beautiful” game than parking the bus. It’s agricultural nasty and , if they win, hopefully punished by a season of misery.”It’s a fair point, he took a frightful caning.

55 mins: Mitrovic flashes a header wide. Terry nowhere. Hard not to agree with Sean Lally’s tweet: “Bruce needs to be brave and take Terry off. He’s adding nothing to Villa and is more a liability than an asset right now ....”

6.14pm BST

53 mins: Fulham’s resolve being sorely tested and they are playing on the counter. Sessegnon tried to put Kamara through but the pass was overhit. 

6.13pm BST
18:13

52 mins: Odomah is the danger man, he puts Hourihane into space in an inside-left position, but the pass, presumably aimed at Grabban, skews wide. Or was it a shot? Doubtful he even knows.

51 mins: Villa a different proposition here. Powerful, forceful and dangerous.

49 mins: Terry gets closed down, as Johansen charges in. No rest for the wicked, and not those who face Fulham.

46 mins: A change in Villa’s approach? Lewis Grabban charges down Bettenelli. Looks like the high press is the way forward. Jack Grealish is also marauding forward. "

Every World Cup breaks new ground. The first tournament was held in 1930; qualification was introduced for 1934; the first Asian team (the Dutch East Indies or, as they are called now, Indonesia) featured in 1938; British teams took part in 1950; the 1954 World Cup was the first on TV; all four Home Nations competed for the first (and, so far, only) time in 1958.Marcos Coll scored the World Cup’s first Olympic goal in 1962; World Cup Willie, the first mascot, turned up in 1966; yellow cards made an appearance in 1970; the new trophy was presented in 1974; Tunisia became the first African team to win a match at the finals in 1978; Hungary broke the double-figure barrier in their 10-1 win over El Salvador in 1982; Mexico became the first two-time hosts in 1986; the Republic of Ireland made their debut in 1990 and went to the quarter-finals without winning a match; the final was decided on penalties for the first time in 1994; Laurent Blanc scored the first golden goal in 1998; two countries hosted in 2002; the 2006 tournament was the first without a hat-trick; South Africa became the first hosts to go out at the first round in 2010; goal-line technology and free-kick foam were introduced in 2014. And now, in 2018, we have VAR.VAR has come a long way in a short space of time. It was first trialled two years ago in a match between two MLS reserve sides. The A-League in Australia became the first professional league to use it and MLS, Serie A, the Bundesliga and the Copa Libertadores have followed suit – although the Premier League is still resisting its dubious charms.

Manchester United must know that it is a possibility that they will spend another season in the shadow of their formidable neighbours. The most famous club in England are 19 points behind Manchester City with one game remaining and while this forgettable draw secured second place for José Mourinho’s spluttering team, that will not be cause for celebration when they consider the ease with which Pep Guardiola’s record-breaking champions have cantered into the distance.The gap is vast and United will struggle to cut it as long as they continue to toil against opponents as limited as West Ham. Mourinho argued that a point was a respectable reward but United’s fans, who spent much of the second half bellowing their support for the hospitalised Sir Alex Ferguson on a drab night, must be concerned at their team’s negative approach.Forget about the late sideshow flare-up between Paul Pogba and Mark Noble The real intrigue was that when Mourinho turned to his bench as this dire game neared its conclusion, he did not consider the merits of Anthony Martial. Instead he opted for caution, turning to Eric Bailly and Ashley Young to see United over the line, and Martial stayed in his seat, yawning along with the rest of us.“When the game goes to minute 70 or 75, you don’t win, you don’t lose,” Mourinho said. “We deserved the point and second position. When you are not ready to be champion, second position is the best available.”It might seem harsh to be critical given that United got the job done, assuming their task was to participate in a grim slog. Yet it is hard to shake off the impression Mourinho is managing expectations in an effort to make it seem that he cannot be blamed for his team’s failure to compete with City.He had glowered more than usual before this game and his observation that some of the players at his disposal are not good enough to challenge Guardiola’s side did not seem like a classic motivational ploy.United, who made eight changes after their defeat at Brighton, rarely suggested that they were going to respond to their manager’s curious form of tough love. They needed time to adjust to an unfamiliar 3-4-1-2 system and although they looked solid in the central areas, it must have alarmed Mourinho when Chris Smalling’s failure to deal with Aaron Cresswell’s cross almost allowed Marko Arnautovic to give West Ham an early lead.Arnautovic turned an awkward header over, however, and United started to threaten sporadically. Pogba had the freedom to roam behind Alexis Sánchez and Jesse Lingard, and Mourinho’s side could argue that they were unfortunate not to be in front at the interval. Scott McTominay sent a shot inches wide after an error from Manuel Lanzini, Lingard had two swerving shots pushed away by Adrián, and West Ham were indebted to a brilliant piece of athleticism from their goalkeeper in the 23rd minute.Sánchez, who scored a hat-trick for Arsenal on this ground last season, must have been licking his lips when Antonio Valencia found him with a cut-back from the right. He had time to pick his spot and he tried to bend a shot high to Adrián’s right. The Spaniard responded with a sharp stop, however, and then he sprang back into position to turn Luke Shaw’s fizzing low drive against the woodwork.It is two years to the day since West Ham said farewell to Upton Park with an emotional victory over United and with his team’s Premier League status secured, there was an argument that this was an opportunity for David Moyes to let go of the handbrake.Yet West Ham’s pragmatic display had a sapping effect on the atmosphere and did little to further the Scot’s case that he deserves a contract extension at the end of the season. “I thought the players showed a great attitude,” Moyes said. “Sometimes when you get safe you can slip away with it but they were at it the whole night. It was a thoroughly deserved point.”At least Arnautovic gave it a go. The Austrian took on United’s back three on his own at times and he deserved better after a powerful surge down the right only for João Mário to jab the cross wide from close range.With Romelu Lukaku unavailable and Mourinho waiting until the 74th minute to bring on Marcus Rashford, United’s attacks lacked a potent presence. Sánchez was persistent and he almost took advantage of indecision from Adrián early in the second half, however. Yet West Ham were relieved that Angelo Ogbonna raced back to head the Chilean’s chip off the line. Declan Rice, another assured presence at the back, would also earn appreciative applause for a fine tackle on Sánchez.West Ham’s reluctance to throw caution to the wind was hard to justify, with Moyes waiting until the 66th minute to introduce Andy Carroll. Yet the temperature only rose when Pogba and Noble clashed. Both men were booked but Carroll could face punishment from the Football Association after appearing to lash out at Shaw. At least Noble and Pogba had cooled down sufficiently to share an embrace after the final whistle."

Cameron McGeehan picked a good time to score his first Scunthorpe goal as his late leveller forced a 2-2 draw with Rotherham in their League One play-off semi-final first leg at Glanford Park.Substitute Joe Newell’s goal 58 seconds after coming on looked like giving the Millers the advantage but McGeehan, on loan from Barnsley, bundled home from close range in the 88th minute.Rotherham had twice led after Jon Taylor’s early goal was cancelled out barely a minute later by a Michael Ihikewe own goal, but they will still be happy with the result and will be favourites to progress to Wembley when they host the second leg on Wednesday night. McGeehan’s late intervention does mean, though, that Iron remain undefeated under caretaker manager Nick Daws since taking over from Graham Alexander in March.“If you’d have given me a draw before the game I would have been happy with that,” the Rotherham manager, Paul Warne, said. “To come away from here 2-1 up would have been a great result but I can’t be greedy. Scunny played well, they are a great side so to come here and match them on their own turf is good and we can take credit for that.”Daws said: “I know we can be better, we can pass the ball better. We attacked with vigour and zest but not consistently enough. What I have seen gives me enough confidence we can go to Rotherham and get a result.”In League Two, Lincoln and Exeter could not be separated as they fought out a tense 0-0 draw in the first leg of their semi-final.Matt Rhead went closest for the Imps at Sincil Bank, hitting the bar with a header early in the second half. That chance came amid Lincoln’s best spell of the game which saw Matt Green denied twice by Exeter keeper Christy Pym.The Grecians’ best chances fell to striker Jayden Stockley, who was denied by keeper Ryan Allsop and then blazed over just before the break. The result sets up an intriguing second leg in Devon on Thursday night.Marc McNulty’s controversial late penalty earned Coventry a 1-1 draw at home to Notts County in the other semi-final, after Jonathan Forte tapped home the opener for the visitors four minutes after half-time. Three minutes from time Matt Tootle was punished for a seemingly innocuous challenge on Tom Bayliss and McNulty kept his cool."

Goodness knows, it seemed weird enough when Bruce Rioch took over at Highbury in 1995 after nine years of George Graham. It must have felt very strange when Bertie Mee left after a decade in 1976 to be replaced by Terry Neill of Tottenham Hotspur. As for the times Herbert Chapman and Tom Whittaker died in office, well, we can only imagine. But this is uncharted territory. This is positively trippy. After 22 years of Arsène Wenger, there’s a new guy in town. Arsenal manager Unai Emery. Arsenal manager Unai Emery. Arsenal manager Unai Emery. Yes, it feels odd saying it, doesn’t it. Like your lips have gone numb. Like your teeth don’t fit. Like the dentist has injected some of the really good stuff into your gum. Then nipped out for a quick fag, leaving you to help yourself to the gas. It really does feel quite odd.Such are the uncertainties at the dawn of a new epoch. Arsenal fans will be hoping Emery is a more formidable follow-up act to a long-serving legendary figure than Rioch, who only lasted one year, winning nothing, though admittedly did sign Dennis Bergkamp. They’ll certainly hope he fares better than Whittaker’s successor Jack Crayston, who resigned in frustration over the board’s parsimony in the transfer market. Oh dear. Oh lummee. A similar performance to Neill – one FA Cup in seven years – won’t cut the mustard in these Troopz-patrolled days either. So all that’s left by way of comparison is George Allison, the successor to Chapman. He won a couple of titles and the FA Cup in short order. No pressure, then, Unai!To be fair to Arsenal, they’re not piling too much on the 46-year-old Spaniard. He’s technically only the head coach, and not the manager, as he won’t have any responsibility for spending the club’s 47½p transfer budget. He’s also been given a realistic short-term brief: just get the club back into Big Cup. Though let’s see how well his job title protects him if this summer’s signings are dodgy and the club finish fifth next season.Emery was officially unveiled on Wednesday afternoon and delivered his platitudes – “I am very excited for this opportunity at a big club in a great city with a grand stadium and great players” – leaving Ivan Gazidis to utter the most revealing line. “We don’t believe there’s a position in world football more attractive than Arsenal Football Club,” the chief suit chirped, immediately motioning to scratch his nose, a move popularised by Bill Clinton during his grand jury testimony about Monica Lewinsky.The Fiver wishes Emery well, if only to avoid the inevitable deluge of Ooh You Are Awful headlines that will mean absolutely nothing to anyone living outside the UK or born after 1978. Good luck also to all the north London entrepreneurs already knocking out T-shirts, mugs and other items of merchandise with Unai’s name on in that 70s font.“Michael is very old with great experience and good knowledge. He is a leader of men and he knows how to win games. He is as fit as a butcher’s dog and he is a great man to work with. Take care. Martin” – Chesterfield manager and apparent media officer Martin Allen with the unveiling of new signing Michael Nelson.Yes, it’s our not-singing, not-dancing World Cup Fiver.

It was an epic night, filled with so many different storylines, and unfortunately for Liverpool’s accident-prone goalkeeper, Loris Karius, he will have to live with the fact that his part will be remembered for just as long as, or possibly longer than, Gareth Bale’s spectacular bicycle kick or the tears from Mohamed Salah.For Bale it was a personal triumph with two of Real Madrid’s goals and a man-of-the-match award from a final he did not enter until the 61st minute. His flying, acrobatic volley, only two minutes after coming on, will go straight into the list of the greatest all-time goals in a Champions League final and put Madrid, with their 13th triumph, on their way to emulating the great Ajax and Bayern Munich teams of the 1970s with a third successive win.That, however, tells only part of the story from a night when Karius was a danger to his own team, responsible for Madrid’s two other goals and last seen wandering aimlessly around the pitch – alone, distraught and clearly traumatised – to ask forgiveness, hands clasped, from the thousands of Liverpool supporters. Karius looked broken. He chose a bad night to be so vulnerable and Liverpool will always wonder what might have happened if the German had not turned the night into his own personal ordeal. Or, indeed, if they had not lost Salah, half an hour in, with the shoulder injury that turned the match in Madrid’s favour.Salah looked inconsolable as he was led from the pitch and Sergio Ramos had some nerve offering a sympathetic hug on the way off. Ramos had locked Salah’s right arm and turned him, judo-style, as they lost balance going for the same ball. Television replays hardened the suspicion it was a calculated move on Ramos’s part and, when Salah landed with a hell of a thud, the damage was considerable. That blow could conceivably put the Egyptian out of the World Cup, too.His absence was a grievous setback for Liverpool, who had looked the more dangerous team until that point, and it would not be sour grapes for the losers to think that was the moment the game started to swing away from them. They had started so thrillingly but all their early momentum was lost once Salah went off. It never properly came back and the players in red took a long time – too long, probably – to adjust to being without the man who had scored 44 times over a record-breaking season. Without Salah, they never looked so threatening again.Ultimately, though, the difficult truth for Liverpool, and the tragic Karius, is that two of the goals they conceded were almost beyond comprehension, and how many times has Jürgen Klopp been warned this team risks being undermined by the lack of an elite goalkeeper? Karius has too much previous for this to be considered a one-off and, as goalkeeping mistakes go, his errors in the 51st and 83rd minutes were as bad as one another. In fact, they were not just bad. They were appalling, so wretched it was difficult to recall a worse goalkeeping performance in any major final through the years.His meltdown – for that is exactly what it was – started with the opening goal when he came to the edge of his penalty area to collect a ball that Toni Kroos, trying to set Karim Benzema free, had overhit. All Karius had to do was pick up the ball and roll it to Trent Alexander-Arnold on the right of defence. He got the second part horribly wrong, as if unaware that Benzema was still lurking, and the striker was able to flick out a boot to intercept the underarm throw. That was all it needed and, almost in slow motion, the ball trickled into an exposed goal.Liverpool’s equaliser came within four minutes. James Milner swung the ball over from a corner on the right and Sadio Mané, Liverpool’s most dangerous player, was alive in the six-yard area. Dejan Lovren won the header and, when Mané flashed his shot past Keylor Navas, it seemed as though Klopp’s team might have the momentum again.Instead Zinedine Zidane turned to Bale, playing possibly his final game for Madrid, and it was an incredible way in which the Welshman announced his presence – a twisting, mid-air bicycle kick to redirect Marcelo’s left-wing cross and flash the ball into Liverpool’s net. Zidane against Bayer Leverkusen in 2002? Mario Mandzukic for Juventus in 2017? Bale’s effort belongs in the same category. There was even applause from Liverpool’s fans when it was replayed on the giant screens.At 2-1 Liverpool came back again and Mané, in particular, kept threatening, fizzing a low shot against the post. Yet Bale was clearly emboldened by his first goal and, when he let fly again from 40 yards, the ball swerved in front of Karius and went through the goalkeeper’s hands. Perhaps Karius’s confidence had been damaged by the earlier mistake. Maybe the swerve was deceptive. At this level, however, there can be no excuses for such a mistake and, in that exact moment, everyone inside the Olimpiyskiy Stadium must have known there was no way back for Liverpool. If anything, they were fortunate not to suffer more damage in the second half. Madrid could also look back on Isco hitting the crossbar and there was an extraordinary moment when Cristiano Ronaldo was shaping to shoot only to be interrupted by a pitch invader from the end where the Madridistas were going through their victory songs.For the most part Liverpool had contained Ronaldo and Klopp’s team had often played well, particularly before Salah’s injury. The problem was that their goalkeeper had the worst night of his professional life. It was a sixth successive defeat for Klopp in a major final and at the final whistle, with Karius burying his face into the turf, there was not exactly a stampede of team-mates wanting to console him."

Manuel Pellegrini is the favourite to succeed David Moyes as manager of West Ham United, with the club expected to make an announcement on their chosen candidate next week.Pellegrini, who led Manchester City to the Premier League title in 2014 and is in charge at Hebei China Fortune, is due in London for talks with David Sullivan, the West Ham co-chairman.Sullivan had issued a statement on Thursday that was bullish even by his standards. It reflected a confidence that a deal was close for the new manager and it has since emerged that Pellegrini could be easier to get than the other manager prominent on Sullivan’s wishlist – Rafael Benítez of Newcastle United.“We are now very close to reaching an agreement,” Sullivan said. “We are preparing to appoint a manager who has a proven record of success at the highest level.”There have been reports in Pellegrini’s native Chile that he has signed a contract at West Ham but the club say that is not true. Pellegrini is keen to return to Europe, where he managed Villarreal, Real Madrid and Málaga before his three-season stint at City.Benítez was close to accepting the West Ham job in 2015 following the departure of Sam Allardyce only to move to Real Madrid. Sullivan has remained an admirer and Benítez is still in the frame. But there is the realisation that prising him from St James’ Park would be problematic.Benítez has 12 months on his contract and it would effectively cost £6m to get him out of that. He wants assurances from the Newcastle owner, Mike Ashley, over transfers and proposed improvements to the training ground and academy.Moyes joined West Ham last November on a contract to the end of the season and he succeeded in keeping the club in the Premier League after they were threatened by relegation. He felt he deserved another deal but he walked away on Wednesday after it became clear to him that the club were courting other managers.West Ham’s Michail Antonio, meanwhile, is a target for Crystal Palace who are looking to build on their end-of-season momentum by completing early transfer business. Antonio, 28, can play in wide midfield, up front or even at full-back – versatility that has impressed Roy Hodgson – and the Palace manager would be likely to use him off the wing to cover the departure of Ruben Loftus-Cheek, whose loan from Chelsea has expired.Palace fear that West Ham could place too high a price for them on Antonio, although the east London club’s intentions are not yet clear as they prioritise the appointment of a manager. Antonio has been called up by England but he is yet to win a cap.Hodgson will be busy in the coming weeks. He will talk to Yohan Cabaye, Joel Ward and Bakary Sako about new contracts; the trio are set to become free agents in the summer.Cabaye, who is wanted by Marseille, would prefer to remain in London but may have to accept a wage cut. Palace have explored midfield contingencies, such as Stoke City’s Joe Allen, and they also like Leander Dendoncker of Anderlecht.Palace have an interest in the right-backs Almamy Touré and Ryan Fredericks of Monaco and Fulham respectively, and will sign the Getafe goalkeeper Vicente Guaita on a Bosman free transfer. They have offered fresh terms to their long-serving goalkeeper Julián Speroni."

Roberto Mancini, the former Manchester City manager, has been confirmed as the new head coach of Italy. He succeeds Gian Piero Ventura, who was sacked in November after Italy missed out on the World Cup for the first time since 1958.The 53-year-old will begin the job in the unlikely setting of a friendly against Saudi Arabia in Switzerland on 28 May and one of his first decisions will be whether to recall Mario Balotelli, whom he often clashed with when the pair were at City. Balotelli has not been called up by Italy since the 2014 World Cup.Mancini won a surprisingly modest 36 caps for Italy and never played at a World Cup, although he was an unused member of the 1990 squad.He began his coaching career with Fiorentina in 2001 and won the Coppa Italia in his first season even though the club was plagued by financial problems.He then moved to Lazio but had his biggest success at Internazionale, where he won three successive Serie A titles. That was followed by a stint at City, where he won the 2012 Premier League title and the FA Cup in a four-season spell.Since then Mancini has coached at Galatasaray, had another spell at Inter and a season at Zenit."

Liverpool left it typically late to seal Champions League qualification but their farewell to an uplifting Premier League season and warm-up for Real Madrid was otherwise faultless. Mohamed Salah began an emphatic defeat of Brighton with a record 32nd goal of the league campaign and another Kop favourite, Andy Robertson, closed it with his first for the club. Anfield absorbed the exhibition in between.“The perfect finale to a very exciting, intense season,” said Jürgen Klopp. “We showed again the kind of football that we couldn’t in the last few games because the boys are human, not machines.”Salah’s contribution this season suggests otherwise. The Egypt international ended the afternoon with the Golden Boot, presented by Kenny Dalglish while his young daughter, Makka, enjoyed a kick-about, and as the most prolific goalscorer in a 38-game Premier League season, eclipsing Luis Suárez, Cristiano Ronaldo and Alan Shearer in the process.Salah has not been the only Liverpool player to deliver consistently when it mattered. Klopp’s team qualified for the Champions League for a second season running with an unbeaten home record. This sunny Sunday-afternoon stroll against Chris Hughton’s side was also the 14th occasion that Liverpool scored four or more goals in a game. Only once, in 1895-96, has that record been bettered.Klopp said of his leading goalscorer: “It’s fantastic what he has done. The last few weeks especially were difficult with every single day someone saying how brilliant you are and giving you an Oscar for this, an award for that, even getting out of the car without having an accident. This gives us a big boost. Imagine if the only chance to get into the Champions League was to win the Champions League final. That’s maybe not the best option to choose, but it’s exciting now.”Golden Boot? Come here to daddy 😂 pic.twitter.com/GasYbIerEmBrighton, survival ensured and their own season a success, tried to deliver a contest but were outclassed to such an extent that their neat passing game was confined to their own penalty area. They had nowhere else to go. Liverpool laid siege to Mathew Ryan’s goal from the start with Klopp picking Dominic Solanke on top of his imperious front three and seeing his team take complete control. Only poor finishing, overelaboration and Kevin Friend’s aversion to giving penalties delayed the inevitable.The referee was well-placed when Shane Duffy handled a cross and felled Salah but waved away both appeals. When Sadio Mané then shot straight at Ryan having been played clean through by the impressive Solanke it could have been a cue for apprehension among the home fans. But they appear immune to that these days. There is a belief in their team’s potency that the unerring accuracy of Salah has helped cement and the first time he found space inside a crowded Brighton area another record fell at his feet.Salah broke the Premier League scoring record when Trent Alexander-Arnold drove through the Brighton midfield and found Solanke on the edge of the area. The striker turned the ball on to Salah, who needed one touch to create space for a low left-foot finish. It was his 44th goal in total this season. A hat-trick against Real Madrid on 26 May will be required to equal Ian Rush’s all-time Liverpool record.Dejan Lovren delivered the comfort of a two-goal lead with a towering header from Robertson’s inviting cross after Brighton cleared a corner but left the centre-half unmarked for the return ball. The cushion should have arrived earlier but Mané, having found himself through on goal once more, attempted to gift-wrap a second for Salah and enabled Ryan to intercept before Duffy blocked his second attempt on the goalline. Klopp went apoplectic in his technical area at Liverpool’s indulgence. It never seemed likely to cost them.Georginio Wijnaldum and Roberto Firmino wasted excellent chances before the break – several in the Brazilian’s case – but the scoreline offered a more accurate reflection of Liverpool’s dominance when Solanke struck his first league goal for the club. It was an excellent finish too, created by Salah, who took Firmino’s pass and evaded two challenges before releasing Solanke inside the area. The Chelsea graduate gave Ryan no chance with a powerful drive that flew in via the underside of the bar.To cap a perfect afternoon for Klopp’s team the final goal of the home season fell to the popular Robertson, perfectly placed to open his Liverpool account after Danny Ings’ cross deflected into his path. Adding to the manager’s satisfaction was the complete absence of fatigue in his players, something that had slowed their approach to the finishing line, having had a week to prepare for Brighton. A fortnight before Kiev looks ideal.“A few people have asked me whether it’s too long but no, it’s perfect,” said Klopp. “It’s like a little pre-season for us. The boys need a little bit of rest. We will give them two days now and then we will go to a camp. We will not train high intensity, we will do a little tactical stuff, a little fitness work, keep them in shape and then we have five days to prepare for the last game. We are all happy about that.”"

Neil Lennon says he should escape punishment for his on-pitch celebration of Hibernian’s equaliser in an extraordinary 5-5 draw at home against Rangers after accusing the visiting support of targeting him with sectarian chants.The Hibernian manager ran on to the field for around 10 seconds after Jamie Maclaren levelled in stoppage time and was ushered down the tunnel by the fourth official, Bobby Madden, before the final whistle blew.The incident is likely to result in Lennon – who has a suspended two-match ban for his behaviour towards the referee Kevin Clancy in February – facing punishment. But he said his aeroplane-style celebration was his response to taunts from the away end.“Well they make it personal don’t they?” he said. “You all hear it. They are singing sectarian songs at me. It’s just a little bit of: ‘Have some of that.’“It was worth it. Trust me. Bobby was fine about it. I should not get a ban for that. I was just letting them know how pleased I was to get the equaliser. I enjoyed the moment. It was a big jumbo jet there.”Look at Neil Lennon! 😂😂😂He runs on the pitch to celebrate Hibs' late equaliser!5-5 😱 pic.twitter.com/QncG4WwjlpLennon’s description of the action as “absolutely bonkers” summed up an astonishing game. Rangers looked set to be blown away when Florian Kamberi, Scott Allan and Maclaren put Hibs 3-0 up after 22 minutes. But they mounted a stunning fightback: James Tavernier, Jordan Rossiter, Bruno Alves, Jason Holt and Josh Windass took them into a 5-3 lead.Another Maclaren goal set Rangers on edge and after Holt was sent off Maclaren completed his hat-trick by prodding in an equaliser.Rangers had to better Aberdeen’s result at Celtic to claim second spot and they finished third after Aberdeen won 1-0 thanks to an Andrew Considine goal early in the second half. Aberdeen’s Shay Logan was shown a red card after the final whistle. Derek McInnes said he was not sure exactly what prompted the sending-off, although Logan was involved with certain Celtic players amid some exuberant celebrations towards the home fans.At Rugby Park Lee Erwin’s early strike gave Kilmarnock a 1-0 win against a Hearts team featuring eight teenagers.

football,"European Club Association chairman hits out at Gianni Infantino’s Club World Cup plan and wants more Champions League games for the elite and fewer domestic matches

Wed 23 May 2018 19.02 BST

European football’s gilded elite assembling for Saturday’s Champions League final in Kiev will be more abuzz with intrigue than normal after Uefa’s public slapdown of the Fifa president Gianni Infantino’s effort to railroad through a new format for the Club World Cup. Increasingly influential in the thick of it will be Andrea Agnelli, fourth-generation scion of the famed Fiat- and Juventus-founding dynasty, chairman of Juve since 2010 and, since September, of the powerful European Club Association (ECA).Trim in his grey pinstripe suit, talking assuredly at the Guardian offices this week while in London for a board meeting of Fiat Chrysler – turnover €111bn last year – the 42-year-old Agnelli came to bury Infantino’s grand plan. But, as he explains, it becomes clear that he sees this row as a mere squall in a six-year quest towards his own vision, which many in football may find more challenging, its ambition no less than “a big project in reshaping European football”.His proposed reordering is clearly thought out already: for the top clubs to play more European prestige games – and make more money – by expanding the Champions League format. He argues the European elite should play fewer games in their national leagues, which should reduce the number of clubs, even divisions.This prospect has barely been raised in England, where the so-called big six clubs are more immediately trying to secure a greater share of their own league’s international-TV millions. But Agnelli repeatedly emphasises that top Premier League teams are involved in the discussions.“We all want more international [European] games and less domestic, combined with an overall reduction of games because we don’t want to go over a certain number. And we said: ‘Let’s come up with a proposal.’”Agnelli suggests the expansion should keep 32 clubs qualifying for the Champions League, but have four groups of eight teams in the opening stage instead of eight of four. That would mean each club plays at least 14 matches, eight more than the current six. Asked what this will mean for national leagues, Agnelli appears comfortable with them being further undermined.“You could say that whoever participates [in the expanded Champions League] has to play in the national league with six U21 or U23 players,” he suggests, but adds the qualifier: “But it’s brainstorming because there isn’t a project at the moment.”There is the suspicion that European clubs such as Juventus might see such expansion of the Champions League as a way to bridge the financial gap with the Premier League, whose £8.4bn 2016‑19 TV deal dwarfs them all. Juventus are exceptional in Serie A for having modernised – opening the Allianz Stadium in 2011 – and dramatically improved their football and financial performances – revenues last year were €563m, up 45% – since Agnelli took over in 2010 following the 2006 Calciopoli scandal. This season’s scudetto is the club’s seventh in a row, as Serie A becomes, like most European leagues, much less competitive.Agnelli argues that other Italian clubs must improve their “competences” and a new chief executive, shortly to be appointed, must overhaul the domestic league’s fortunes. “[In] Serie A, the product has come to one of its lowest moments,” he says.The Agnellis still own 64% of Juventus, which was taken over in 1923 by Andrea’s grandfather, Edoardo, primarily as a bonding experience for Fiat employees in Turin. Andrea describes the family’s attachment as “first and foremost pure passion”, with an emphasis on a core of Italian players, captained until his final game for the club this month by the goalkeeping great Gianluigi Buffon, who is godfather to Agnelli’s one-year-old daughter, Livia.He describes Juventus, and Fiat, of which the Agnellis hold a 30% stake in the merged carmaker with Chrysler, as “literally part of the DNA of the family”. Yet, as the club’s chairman in the era of football’s huge commercialisation, he talks about Juventus in the language of business. “Whether we are Man United, Real Madrid, Juventus, or Legia Warsaw, Sporting Lisbon, and Anderlecht, we all want more international exposure, to develop our brands. Today everything is about brand exposure,” he says.Agnelli envisages the new format being a part of reordering the football calendar after its current schedule and the agreed Champions League formats run out in 2024. He talks also of “harmonisation”, of transfer windows and refereeing, and a mandatory summer month of rest for the players.Challenged that this plan sounds like another European breakaway venture by the already rich clubs, Agnelli does not deny the suggestion. “But I think if we manage to find some grounds in which we can discuss this with the European national [football] associations, the European leagues, Uefa and the clubs, I think it’s just a normal evolution you would have in the game.”His perspective on the row with Infantino is that they were beginning to discuss this proposed general “reshaping” of football over the next six years when the Fifa president suddenly produced his plan for an enlarged Club World Cup and the League of Nations, backed by a promised $25bn minimum guarantee from unnamed investors. The Japanese bank Softbank has not confirmed reports that it was fronting the consortium, whose identities were kept confidential by agreement. Infantino told the Fifa council there was a 60-day deadline for agreement, and sought to have the plan approved in March.The Fifa council refused and asked for more time. “Probably the first time that a motion didn’t pass within the Fifa council,” Agnelli says wryly. “That should make you think.”Then Infantino invited seven top clubs, including Manchester United and Manchester City, to hear the proposals in Zurich, infuriating the ECA because it represents the clubs collectively. Juventus were invited, but Agnelli says he told Infantino in advance he was opposed and another senior executive, the head of public affairs, Stefano Bertola, went instead of him. With big money promised to participating clubs, Real Madrid and Barcelona emerged talking positively, but Agnelli is scathing about the whole process.“If you go around to anybody saying: ‘Do you want to play football for a couple of weeks, on average you get €150m, the answer is going to be yes – it’s fairly obvious.”Whatever you propose in football you will not be 100% backed. The point is the stakeholders should sit and discuss itHe describes as “dodgy” the financial projections, which were to remain at $3bn for each tournament and not increase over 12 years, and as “tricky” the apparent plan for the investors to share with Fifa 50% of any profit. While acknowledging that the Club World Cup could do with improvement, Agnelli says: “This is too important for the future of football than to enter it with no information, blindfolded.”Asked if he thinks Infantino was seeking to expand Fifa’s sphere of influence by drawing in more clubs, Agnelli replies: “Probably he was looking at that. But as I told him, the better idea is thinking about what is the role of Fifa, the governing body? Fifa should be a governing body about good practices, not about entering commercial joint ventures with unknown investors.”After the Fifa corruption scandals culminating in the 2015 arrests and US prosecutions, Agnelli says he expected Fifa under Infantino to embrace good governance, but argues this proposal was reminiscent of the old ways. “I am surprised the way they are behaving at the moment,” he says.This week the ECA has sent a strong letter to Fifa complaining that several national FAs are calling up players for the World Cup too early, and he refers with bewilderment to the recent proposal at Fifa for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to be expanded to include 48 teams. “Hence,” he says, “it is difficult to understand what is really going through the Fifa president’s mind at this moment.”Infantino shelved his plan this week, having accepted that the resistance from the Fifa council, clubs and Uefa, whose professional football strategy council issued a statement expressing “serious reservations” made pushing it through untenable.Turning again to his own unabashedly commercial plans, and the prospect of resistance to them as another club breakaway project, Agnelli says: “Whatever you propose in football you will not be 100% backed. The point is the stakeholders should sit down and discuss it. You have competitive balance [problems], polarisation, we want to sit down and talk about it. This would be under Uefa auspices, and there would be [financial] solidarity mechanisms. I am on the record with you but I can assure you that many of my colleagues have very similar views.”Then he was off, for more business in London before heading to Kiev, having dismissed the Fifa president’s dash for cash as a skirmish on the way to his own more substantial campaign: to reshape European football and advance the top clubs even further."

Portugal’s defensive frailties were again exposed as England’s first group stage opponents Tunisia hit back from two goals behind to hold the European champions to a 2-2 draw in a World Cup warm-up on Monday.Portugal, who rested their captain and leading scorer, Cristiano Ronaldo, after he played in Saturday’s Champions League final for Real Madrid, went ahead through Andrá Silva’s header from Ricardo Quaresma’s pinpoint cross in the 22nd minute.The midfielder João Mário doubled the lead when he rifled in a shot from outside the penalty area and Portugal, who face Spain, Morocco and Iran in their World Cup group, seemed to be in control.The cracks began to appear five minutes later, however, when Anice Badri was left alone inside the penalty area to fire past Anthony Lopes and pull one back for Tunisia who face England on 18 June in Volgograd.Portugal’s defence imploded in their previous game, a 3-0 friendly defeat by the Netherlands in March, and gave their coach, Fernando Santos, more cause for concern in the 64th minute.They failed to clear a free-kick properly and, when the ball was played back in, Fakhreddine Ben Youssef got between four defenders to slide the ball home with the hosts appealing in vain for offside.Elsewhere Olivier Giroud and Nabil Fekir staked their claims for France’s World Cup opener as they struck to condemn the Republic of Ireland to a 2-0 friendly defeat amid a torrential Parisian downpour.Chelsea’s Giroud scored from close range and then saw the keeper Colin Doyle’s howler hand Fekir a second before the half-time whistle sounded on a night when Didier Deschamps’ Russia-bound side turned in a slick display.Mario Balotelli returned to Italy duty with a bang following a four-year absence as his first-half goal set the tone for a 2-1 friendly victory over Saudi Arabia in St Gallen."

Arsenal have suspended two coaches, understood to be for alleged bullying – the under-23s manager, Steve Gatting, and his assistant, Carl Laraman. The precise nature of the complaint is unclear but the club have confirmed they have placed them on leave and launched an investigation.Gatting and Laraman were not in the dugout for Tuesday’s Premier League International Cup final against Porto at the Emirates, which was the first public sign that something was amiss. The under-18 coach, Kwame Ampadu, stepped up to take the team and he oversaw a 1-0 defeat.An Arsenal spokesman said: “We have suspended two coaches and launched an investigation following complaints from some players. These are private matters and we will not discuss any further detail.”Arsenal have made great strides at academy level – they won the PL2 title this season – and they did well to reach the final of the International Cup, having been one of 12 English teams to enter alongside a dozen others from mainland Europe.Ivan Gazidis referenced the club’s progress at youth level on the day that Arsène Wenger’s end-of-season departure was confirmed and he said that the manager’s replacement had to be committed to giving young players a chance. “Under the radar, we’ve got a lot of players coming through – not just ones that you already know about but the next generation, as well,” the chief executive said. “That value of giving youth a chance is very important.”Gazidis has overseen a raft of changes at the club, including at youth level, where Per Mertesacker, the soon-to-be-retired defender, will step up at the end of the season to become the academy head, replacing Andries Jonker, who departed in February of last year."
football,"This is where we all are at the moment, gushing at news that Fulham’s teenage wing-back can use a household applianceContact author

Fri 25 May 2018 10.00 BST

To south-west London, where startling news emerged when Fulham’s Supporters Trust held its AGM on Tuesday. An awed hush fell over the room as Alistair Mackintosh, the club’s CEO, told an anecdote that left everyone wiping away the tears. On one occasion this season, Mackintosh revealed, Ryan Sessegnon had a doping test after a night game and by the time he was done everyone had gone, the kit man included. So Sessegnon took his kit home, washed it and ironed it before bringing it in the next day.The story ended there, leaving us to speculate whether Fulham saw fit to frame the hallowed kit in the boardroom at Craven Cottage or offered to donate it to the British Museum, but it wasn’t long before people on social media were talking about “a real nice touch from one of the nicest kids you’ll ever meet”. Some called for Sessegnon to be handed the Nobel Prize for Real Classy Touches. Greg Clarke, head of the Football Association, announced plans to sell Wembley to Sessegnon. Word filtered through to Steven Spielberg, who immediately bought the film rights. “Never has there been a greater act of selflessness,” the director of Schindler’s List said. “I’m thinking of calling it Washing Ryan’s Privates.”The hero in question could not be reached for comment after a whirlwind 24 hours. Partly because much of the previous paragraph is made up. And also because this column has come to the conclusion that asking Sessegnon about his laundry would represent a career low, especially when every other football writer is either penning a feature about Mohamed Salah’s childhood in Egypt or trying to find a room for the night in Kiev.But this is where we are at the moment, gushing at the revelation that Sessegnon is capable of using a household appliance (just wait till you hear about the time he used a microwave without any assistance), and in reality this says more about us than him. There is, of course, plenty of excitement about an 18-year-old who has been brilliant and fearless during Fulham’s carefree charge to Saturday’s Championship play-off final against Aston Villa. Yet headlines about a man washing his clothes feel like a stretch.Admittedly, speaking as a former teenage boy, I can appreciate why there will be parents dumbstruck at the fact that Sessegnon didn’t just burn his clothes after realising that the kit man had left the building. Even then, though, we seem to be reaching a point where so much information is there to be devoured that ordinary things take on a peculiar significance, such that news of Harry Kane’s appointment as England’s World Cup captain featured references to his brave struggle to develop a taste for fish, as though the 24-year-old father of one is actually a nine-year-old boy whose parents are trying to wean him off fish fingers.Fair play to Kane for learning to appreciate the nutritional benefits of grilled salmon. But with Sessegnon’s washing machine adventure also the subject of much deeper analysis than it deserved, it was becoming clear that people cannot help but patronise footballers, even unintentionally. This felt misguided, not to mention a bit hypocritical given that I boiled a kettle that contained no water a couple of nights ago. Continue down this path and we’d be asking Gareth Southgate whether his players have sent out a message to the rest of the world by remembering to pack their shinpads for the school trip to Russia.But righteous indignation at the growing trend of infantilisation does have its limits. There is another side to the argument and that became clear when the tale of Sessegnon’s hardship was followed by claims that Villa are willing to let John Terry, who is a 37-year-old adult, miss both games against Chelsea next season if Steve Bruce’s side win promotion to the Premier League, news of which brought to mind the defender’s ludicrous Stamford Bridge farewell last year.Terry, remember, helped to arrange it so that he could be substituted in the 26th minute against Sunderland, which is reminiscent of the bit in the Dynasty reboot where one of the characters throws herself a lavish fake wedding, complete with peacocks luxuriating in indoor fountains. Nothing but the best! Even though, as one underling points out, peacocks can’t swim. Even though, as none of Terry’s Chelsea team-mates dared say out loud, walking off in the minute that matched his shirt number marked him out as football’s Mariah Carey.Now our captain, leader and legendary party planner is rumoured to be thinking about a follow-up. Some players refuse to celebrate when they score against their old clubs, even holding their arms in the air to apologise for the grievous sin of scoring a goal for their current employer. Terry, however, could be about to take it up a notch. Having rejected offers from Premier League clubs last summer in order to avoid having to play against Chelsea, for whom he made 717 appearances across 22 years, he would be in quite the pickle if Villa went up.Worryingly for all concerned, the final against Fulham takes place on 26 May. It is a sign. But fret not: Villa have recognised the gravity of the situation.Forget about what would happen if they needed to beat Chelsea to stay up or what Terry would do if he ends up managing a team in the same league as his old club. Some things are too precious – like the captain’s armbands that Terry dug out of storage and shaped into the number 26. Let’s just hope he put them in the wash first."

It never really happened for the Wood on Saturday. Walking down Wembley Way before the game, I was shaking my head, still not quite believing the club had made it this far. In the end, the weather was not kind to us and neither was the result. Tranmere had a man sent off after just 48 seconds but for some reason the Wood just didn’t get going. Tranmere have made it to League Two and Boreham Wood will spend another season in the fifth tier.We never expected this kind of excitement anyway. When I asked my eight-year-old son if he wanted to go to the Conference South play-off final between Boreham Wood and Whitehawk back in May 2015, we had no idea we would end up at Wembley just three years later.Being Arsenal supporters, we have managed to make it to Ashburton Grove on a few occasions but, with money often too tight to mention, attending matches regularly just wasn’t an option. I have been to more than 400 Arsenal games and wanted my son to feel the same enjoyment – and disappointment – that goes with being a football supporter. If he didn’t like it, fine. We could move on and we hadn’t wasted a fortune in the process.Yet, as soon as we walked into Meadow Park, things slotted into place. A cup of chips and an exciting win for Boreham Wood left us wanting more. We went back on a number of occasions during the Great Escape season of 2015-16 and I found myself at Welling for the final part of that celebration.More matches followed in 2016-17 and at the end of the campaign we made a big decision. I bought an adult season ticket for just £100, with my son’s under-12 version costing a mere £30. If you feel priced out of football at the top level, it is worth investigating a non-league club near you. You may be pleasantly surprised.We didn’t choose a bad season to commit. Manager Luke Garrard and chairman Danny Hunter made a number of shrewd signings and hopes were high that the team could threaten the new play-off system. Results were a little inconsistent at first. A whopping crowd of 1,920 witnessed a fine win over Leyton Orient but defeats to Dagenham and Redbridge, Wrexham, Maidenhead United and Ebbsfleet checked progress. The Ebbsfleet loss at the tail end of September proved to be a turning point. The Wood went undefeated in their next 12 league matches and, with Bruno Andrade finding the net consistently, the team seemed to be going places.We lapped up the matches amid the familiar faces at Meadow Park. A win at local rivals St Albans set up the club’s first ever win over league opposition in the FA Cup on an unforgettable day in November. The Wood came from behind to secure a breathtaking victory against Blackpool. I was so caught up in the moment I ended up crawling around on my hands and knees, literally knocked off my feet while celebrating Dan Holman’s 88th-minute winner.A strong Wood Army made their way to Coventry for the next round, but it wasn’t meant to be. The players and supporters had no time to feel sorry for themselves, though, as thoughts turned towards pushing for a play-off spot. This ambition was boosted in February when former striker Morgan Ferrier returned to the club. He scored on his first match back, at Eastleigh, and went on to form an impressive partnership with Andrade.A reasonably comfortable 3-1 over relegated Guiseley last month confirmed fourth place and a spot in the play-offs. To make it to Wembley, Boreham Wood would have to beat Fylde at home and then Sutton away three days later. If we thought reaching the play-offs was tense, we hadn’t seen anything yet.Boreham Wood took a two-goal lead against Fylde within 18 minutes but the visitors halved the deficit to set up an excruciating second half – seven minutes of stoppage time hardly helped – with every glance at the clock becoming more and more frequent. When the final whistle went, the relief was immense.A trip to Sutton’s 3G pitch awaited, with injuries beginning to mount. As we drove down to Gander Green Lane, I was anxious that the season was beginning to take its toll. This team fight to the end, though. On an unbearably hot day, they went to the well once more, driven on by on the Wood Army who were melting in the Collingwood Road stand. The team were out on their feet at the end of their 3-2 win and every fan could have kissed goalkeeper Grant Smith after his brilliant late save prevented another 30 minutes of torture.The party was something to behold. Fans, players, management staff and the chairman all joined together to announce to the world that the Wood were going to Wembley. My son, my mum and I were bouncing up and down in the away end. Unbelievably, this small club with an average home attendance of just over 600 had achieved the unthinkable.The 2-1 defeat to Tranmere on Saturday was a tough one to take, but I offered my congratulations to some of their supporters on the way back to the station and a kind man offered a crumb of consolation by pointing out that the last two defeated finalists in the play-offs have returned the next year to win. Maybe we will be back but the club have already given me and my son enough over these last few years.The opportunity to bond together and watch football at affordable prices has been priceless. Going to Boreham Wood matches has given me an escape from a lot of work-related stress over the last few years. Never underestimate the power of sport to provide relief when you feel weighed down with anxiety. The Wood are not popular among followers of other teams; a quick analysis of Twitter confirms that most weeks. Yet, look beyond any personal grievances and you have to admit that Boreham Wood getting to Wembley is a stunning accomplishment. They may have lost at Wembley, but Garrard and his team have provided us with memories that will last forever.• This blog first appeared on That Sports Blog• Follow Steven Pye on Twitter"

Manchester City will have to pay a basic fee of £60m for Riyad Mahrez, with Leicester City also to demand considerable add-ons which could push the final price closer to £75m for the 27-year-old.The total would still be closer to the champions’ own valuation and is considerably lower than the total package of £95m demanded by the 2016 title-winners in January. That resulted in the Manchester club walking away, with the hierarchy believing the demand to be particularly unrealistic.Guardiola turned to Mahrez after Alexis Sanchez joined Manchester United in January and remains interested in adding the wide forward to bolster this area of his squad.In the winter window City never made a formal offer for the 27-year-old, who is under contract until 2020, though informal discussions between City’s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, and his opposite number, Susan Whelan, did take place.Guardiola also wants a defensive midfielder, with Napoli’s Jorginho his No 1 target."

Shrewsbury booked another Wembley appearance by beating Charlton 1-0 in the second leg of the League One play-off semi-final. Carlton Morris, the on-loan Norwich striker, scored just before the hour to secure a 2-0 aggregate victory for the team who finished the season in third place.Paul Hurst’s side, who were beaten by Lincoln at the national stadium in the Checkatrade Trophy final last month, will meet Rotherham or Scunthorpe at Wembley on 27 May.Shrewsbury were bottom of League One when Hurst was appointed manager in October 2016 but are now 90 minutes from playing in the second tier for the first time since 1989.Jon Nolan’s stunning late goal at The Valley meant Shrewsbury kicked off the return leg with an advantage and they started brightly. They created the game’s first chance when Alex Rodman turned sharply and fired in a low shot which was well dealt with by goalkeeper Ben Amos at his near post.Lee Bowyer’s Charlton enjoyed plenty of possession but found clear chances hard to come by. Josh Magennis was well off target with an acrobatic volley and then Nicky Ajose broke into the box but the central defender Aristote Nsiala produced a fine block.Rodman then went close for the home side again just before the break when a neat move down the left saw the winger’s shot from a tight angle well stopped by Amos.Nolan fired wide for Shrewsbury early in the second half before Shaun Whalley’s cross-shot was blocked by Patrick Bauer.The breakthrough arrived in the 58th minute as Whalley ran at the visiting defence down the right and pulled the ball back to Morris, who took a touch and drilled a powerful shot from 15 yards low past Amos.Charlton chased an equaliser but Ben Godfrey came up with a vital block from Joe Aribo’s close-range effort before Jake Forster-Caskey’s 20-yard drive was pushed away by goalkeeper Dean Henderson.Shrewsbury almost grabbed a late second when the visitors had committed men forward but Stefan Payne’s close-range effort was brilliantly kept out by Amos."

Ken Bates, the Chelsea chairman when a number of youth-team footballers claim they were racially abused by their own coaches, has been accused of making “truly shameful” comments after criticising the alleged victims for wanting to keep their identities secret and questioning why they did not report it when they were children.Bates suggested the reason for “all these ancient coming-outs so many years later” was because “the sniff of money is in the air” and said those in question should have found other clubs if the racism they allegedly encountered at Stamford Bridge, from the age of 11 onwards, was so upsetting.Speaking publicly for the first time about the escalating scandal at his former club, Bates said Chelsea used to have some of the more racist fans in England, with the National Front using Stamford Bridge as their “unofficial headquarters”, and said he had taken the first measures to change the culture on the terraces. He did not offer any indication as to whether he believed the allegations surrounding Gwyn Williams and Graham Rix, two of his former employees. “Obviously I’m keeping an open mind about it,” he said.Instead, Bates directed his criticisms towards the players with “their faces shielded, sitting with their backs to the camera”, and said that “what bothers me a bit” was the people in question choosing to remain anonymous. “I thought: ‘How are we going to make any progress? These people have to reveal their identities … and, without being unkind, what did they do about it at the time? If I’d been racially abused I would have told my dad and expected him to support me. Or I could have left the club and joined another one.“It’s all very well to say, ‘Oh well, I didn’t want to say anything or do anything because it might have harmed my career’, but if you’ve got the ability there were plenty of other clubs snapping up young black kids.“The sniff of money is in the air and I think in view of all the terrible miscarriages of justice over allegations of varied abuse – sexual, racial, etcetera – it’s time people should take a tough line. OK, name the people. Name the times. What was actually said? What was your response? This is trial by smear and it’s not good enough.”The Guardian revealed in January that three former youth-team footballers from the 1990s had launched legal claims against Chelsea after allegations of explicit racism by their coaches, including one instance when Rix was said to have thrown a cup of hot coffee in the face of a young black player. Rix, who is also accused of other physical attacks, denies all the allegations.One player’s evidence to the Football Association’s safeguarding department described it as a “feral environment” where black players in the youth team were treated “like a race of fucking dogs”.Explaining why he felt unable to report Williams at the time, he said: “I knew it was unacceptable but I was a minor. When you’re in that position, where this guy is a powerful guy at the club … I didn’t know how to handle it. I thought it would stop. I just didn’t know how to handle it and it was constant … the racial slurs of ‘coon’, ‘wog’, ‘monkey’ … ‘smoking wacky‑backy’, which is marijuana, or ‘black bastard’, ‘fucking black bastard’, ‘mango‑muncher’, ‘nigger’.“Gwyn Williams had been at the club since 1979. He was powerful. He was Ken Bates’s mate. The guy [Williams] is a walking piece of dirt but he had power. It was said he had the biggest black book in London – he knew everyone. That guy was the governor. No matter what role he had, that man had power.”Since then, a number of other complainants have begun their own legal actions about the culture of “continued racist bullying and abuse” that allegedly existed when Williams was involved with the youth team. Two white players, Grant Lunn and Gary Baker, from Chelsea’s youth set‑up in the early 1980s have come forward to back their former team-mates and the club have brought in Barnardo’s to oversee an independent inquiry. Williams and Rix, who share the same solicitor, released a statement in January to deny all the allegations. They have declined a number of requests to speak about the matter.Though it may feel ‘ancient’ to Bates, the pain and suffering these men feel is real and continues to the current dayDino Nocivelli, a solicitor representing a number of complainants from the 90s, said: “Bates’s comments are truly shameful. For far too long, my clients felt they would not be believed and that the club would side with Rix and Williams, two coaches who held extensive power at Chelsea and over their football careers.“My clients take particular offence to Bates criticising them for failing to disclose their identities and for these ‘ancient coming-outs’. The only thing my clients wanted to do as children was to play football and achieve their dream of becoming professional footballers. Instead, they suffered an alleged daily nightmare. These children are now men and, though it may feel ‘ancient’ to Bates, the pain and suffering these men feel is real and continues to the current day. My clients want the truth finally to be exposed.”The first wave of allegations was so serious that Chelsea felt compelled to notify the Football Association and the police were brought in. The police decided after a seven-month investigation there was insufficient evidence to take any action. Chelsea’s last statement about the matter read: “We take allegations of this nature extremely seriously and they will be fully investigated. We are absolutely determined to do the right thing, to assist the authorities and any investigations they may carry out, and to fully support those affected, which would include counselling for any former player that may need it.”Speaking to the Proper Sport Daily podcast, Bates described Chelsea’s response as “good PR” and said his former club had put out what they “would be expected to say”.“But the reality is something different. If we’re going back to those days the whole of football was racist and the worst of all, I’m afraid, was the so-called fans. Chelsea was a very racist club generally and I’m talking about the fans. The National Front had an unofficial headquarters there. In fact, they used to meet in the pub across from the main gates and wait until the team was announced. If there were no black players in the team they’d walk across and buy their tickets. That’s how hate-filled it was.“Chelsea were an all-white team, as were a number of other clubs in those days, and we were bringing black players through the youth ranks. We had one particular one, Paul Canoville, I remember he was named in the squad for the first time in an away game at Crystal Palace. As the players were warming up down the touchline, Paul Canoville was having bananas thrown at him.“The next game we were at home. He was getting so much abuse from a certain section of the crowd I went down to the touchline and, as the final whistle went, I ran on to the pitch and put my arm around him. We walked off the pitch together as a show of solidarity – my way of telling the bad‑mouths what I thought of them. We had a small cheer from some sections of the crowd and that started it [the anti-racism campaign]. By the end of it, the ultimate irony is Chelsea were the first big club to appoint a black manager – [Ruud] Gullit – and had a number of black internationals.”Bates went on to become chairman at Leeds and Williams, who had a variety of roles at Chelsea over more than 25 years, followed him to Elland Road to become the club’s technical director. Williams was dismissed by Leeds for gross misconduct in 2013 after emailing pornographic images of women to a number of colleagues, including a female receptionist."

Everton have ended Sam Allardyce’s miserable six-month spell as manager and have made contact with Marco Silva’s representatives after identifying the Portuguese as their choice to replace him.In a day of major change at Goodison Park, Marcel Brands was appointed director of football to replace Steve Walsh, who has also left the club.Allardyce met Farhad Moshiri, Everton’s major shareholder, at 8.30am on Wednesday in London and was told in a brief discussion that he did not feature in the club’s long-term plans. The 63-year-old had another year remaining on the 18-month contract he signed when succeeding Ronald Koeman last November and, as he obtained a deal with no break clause, he is expected to leave with a £6m payoff. He will have made around £9m for six months’ work.The former England manager, sacked by Everton on the day he could have been announcing the country’s World Cup squad, guided the team from 13th to eighth in the Premier League following a turbulent start to the season under Koeman and then the caretaker manager, David Unsworth. His managerial style never endeared him to Everton supporters, however, and there was mounting hostility towards Allardyce over the final months of the season.“On behalf of the chairman, board of directors and Mr Moshiri, I’d like to thank Sam for the job he has done at Everton over the last seven months,” read a statement from the club’s soon-to-be new chief executive, Professor Denise Barrett-Baxendale. “Sam was brought in at a challenging time last season to provide us with some stability and we are grateful to him for doing that.“However, we have made the decision that, as part of our longer-term plan, we will be appointing a new manager this summer and will be commencing this process immediately. Again, we’d like to place on record our sincere thanks to Sam for his work with us over the last few months and wish him well for the future.”Allardyce’s backroom team of Sammy Lee, Craig Shakespeare and the goalkeeping coach Martyn Margetson have also left as the club undertakes another expensive overhaul of its management structure. The next manager will be the third appointed by Moshiri since he acquired a 49.9% stake in Everton February 2016 with Roberto Martínez, a manager he inherited, Koeman and Allardyce also departing with lucrative payoffs for their poor performances.Brands, technical director at PSV Eindhoven since 2010, has been confirmed as the new director of football, with Walsh paying the price for a disastrous recruitment policy. Everton have coveted the 56-year-old Brands since last summer, with his work in identifying young talent and helping PSV to the Dutch title three times in the past four seasons making him a target for several Premier League clubs.“We need to be competing for honours against the Premier League elite,” said Brands. “It is no straightforward challenge but this must be our motivation each and every day. It is only a challenge such as this which could have persuaded me to leave PSV.”Barrett-Baxendale confirmed that Walsh, who arrived from Leicester in July 2016, had left Everton. She said: “On behalf of the board and Mr Moshiri I’d also like to express our thanks to Steve Walsh.”Moshiri’s first choice to replace Allardyce is former Hull and Watford manager Silva, who was sacked by the Vicarage Road club in January after a dramatic downturn in results. That followed what Watford claimed was an “unwarranted approach” by Everton that affected the focus and results of the Portuguese coach.Watford have made a complaint to the Premier League over Everton’s alleged illegal approach and talks over a compensation package between the clubs have failed to reach an agreement. While Silva is out of contract and technically available to replace Allardyce, the dispute over Everton’s approach complicates that process and could lead to arbitration.Everton officials are expected to reopen talks with their Watford counterparts this week in an attempt to resolve the matter and have already opened discussions with Silva’s representatives as they attempt to make a swift appointment."

Eden Hazard has challenged Chelsea to match his ambitions by indicating his willingness to sign a new contract will be heavily influenced by the club’s moves in the transfer market this summer.Chelsea have been trying to persuade the Belgium forward to sign improved terms for around a year and are willing to give him the most lucrative contract in their history worth around £300,000 a week.Hazard, whose deal runs to 2020, is settled with his family in Surrey and expects to be at the club next season, when they will compete in the Europa League, but he will commit only if satisfied Chelsea have strengthened sufficiently to mount a challenge for the title.Real Madrid have long been linked with Hazard, who has made no secret of his admiration for Zinedine Zidane, and Chelsea, who are expected to part company with Antonio Conte, would face the uncomfortable prospect of the Spanish club formalising that pursuit in the three-week period between the end of the English transfer window and that in Spain, on 31 August. Chelsea would resist a sale, conscious they would be unable to sign a replacement, but their stance would be undermined if Hazard’s head was turned.The 27-year-old knows his next contract could well be the last in his prime. “That’s why I’m taking my time,” he said. “It’s something big, so I need to think about a lot of things. But one thing is for sure: I’m happy here.”Asked to elaborate on the factors that would influence his decision, he added: “I’m waiting for new players next season. I want good players, because I want to win the Premier League next season.“Like I’ve said many times before, I think the FA Cup final is not my last game for Chelsea. It’s the last game of the season, that’s it. After the World Cup then we will be ready for the next season. But, for me in my mind, I’m here. I have one week to play now. Saturday is a massive game, I just want to win, for me and them also.”Hazard, who does not have an agent, declined to indicate when a decision on his future would be made.Conte’s side are seeking to salvage a disappointing Premier League season, which culminated in a 3-0 defeat at Newcastle on Sunday and a fifth-place finish, with victory against Manchester United at Wembley.“We are Chelsea and we need a trophy at the end of the season and, at the moment, we have nothing,” Hazard said. “We have not qualified for the Champions League, so this season has been bad. Now we can save a little bit this season, with this trophy. So we will give everything.“I don’t know [why it has been so bad this season]. It’s always hard after when you win the league. We saw that two years ago. This season was not good but you know – this is Chelsea. You never know what’s happening. But, no, I think this year we dropped too many points at Stamford Bridge. In this condition you can’t be in the top four, so it’s up to us now to save the season with the FA Cup.“We’ve had bad games, but also played a fantastic game against Liverpool recently, so I hope for Saturday the boys will be ready like we were against Liverpool last week. If we play all together, we can do something, especially against Manchester United.”"

Western Sydney will undertake their A-League rebuild under former German international Markus Babbel, who it’s understood has signed a three-year contract with the club.After a month of hunting a successor for sacked Josep Gombau, the Wanderers have announced Babbel as their new coach and the man to steer the club through a period of rejuvenation.The ex-Bayern Munich and Liverpool defender arrives in Australia flush with the pedigree of successful stints with German sides Hertha Berlin, Hoffenheim and VfB Stuttgart.Most recently the 45-year-old managed Socceroos and former Wanderers striker Tomi Juric at Swiss outfit FC Luzern.His best finish over three years with Luzern was third, but Babbel also led Hertha to Bundesliga promotion and qualified Stuttgart for Champions League football.Wanderers chairman Paul Lederer labelled Babbel the right man for the club.“In the next 18 months we will have our new training facility finished, our new stadium open and our club ready to take another giant,” Lederer said.“Having a coach like Markus involved with this club will make us a force in this league as we strive to win trophies, return to the AFC Champions League and make a statement, not only in Australia, but internationally.”  "

As the members of Gareth Southgate’s squad prepare themselves for this summer’s World Cup, the news of the death at the age of 83 of Ray Wilson, the left-back in Alf Ramsey’s Boys of ’66, comes as a sharp and poignant reminder of a different time, when a World Cup winner could retire from the game and spend his remaining decades as a professional undertaker.Like the Liverpool striker Roger Hunt, Everton’s Wilson was destined to be one of the less celebrated members of Ramsey’s immortals. But they were two without whose honesty and diligence the Jules Rimet Trophy could not have been won.Wilson was the oldest member of the team that went out to face West Germany in the final 52 years ago, and the most experienced. He was 31, and had won the first of his 63 caps in 1960, in a 1-1 draw with Scotland, under Walter Winterbottom. He had played in all of England’s four matches at the 1962 World Cup in Chile, including the quarter-final defeat by Brazil that in effect ended Winterbottom’s reign. His right to his place in the 1966 side was unquestioned.In the last two matches of the tournament he was up against Portugal’s José Augusto and then West Germany’s Helmut Haller, the skilful Bologna winger. But Wilson was seldom ruffled, even by the street-smart Haller, and more than earned his place as the fourth man alongside the West Ham trio of Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters in the handsome statue that stands today near the entrance to Upton Park.He was born in Shirebrook, a small Derbyshire town whose salient feature in those days – no longer, of course – was its coal mine and that was also, less predictably, the birthplace of the actors John Hurt and Jason Statham. He was christened Ramon simply because his mother liked the name. His parents split up when he was seven – an unusual occurrence, as he pointed out to the Guardian’s Simon Hattenstone, at that time and in that sort of working-class community.When he was about 13, Wilson ran away from home and stayed away until he was found six weeks later. The arrival of a stepfather he liked helped to settle him down and at 15 he went to work on the railways, cleaning and repairing wagons. But at 17 a schoolteacher put in a word with Huddersfield Town, and his destiny was set.Wilson played for the West Yorkshire club as an amateur before he had to endure two years of national service. On his return in 1955 he was invited to sign professional forms by Huddersfield’s manager, Bill Shankly. Twelve years and 266 league appearances later he followed Shankly’s path to Merseyside – not to Anfield but to Goodison Park, where he played a further 116 league matches as a part of the Everton side managed by Harry Catterick. Alongside such stars as Alex Young, Derek Temple and Brian Labone, he collected an FA Cup winner’s medal in 1966.In that summer’s World Cup the entire England defence – from Gordon Banks in goal to Nobby Stiles in the screening midfield role, with a back four of George Cohen, Jack Charlton, Bobby Moore and Wilson – played every minute of all their six matches while Ramsey tinkered with players such as Jimmy Greaves, Terry Paine, Ian Callaghan and John Connelly in the more advanced areas. “We were basically a defensive team,” Wilson told the journalist David Miller 30 years later. “That was the first quality of the team.”But they could play, too, of course, not least their left-back, a slight figure by comparison with Cohen on the opposite flank but always a resourceful footballer, able to rely on an ability to read the game and anticipate his direct opponent’s moves. At that stage he was one of the England players with a chance of making a World XI, although he would have had to fight off competition from Italy’s Giacinto Facchetti.On his retirement in 1971, after brief spells with Oldham Athletic and Bradford City, Wilson and his wife, Pat, returned to Huddersfield. There he set up his own undertaking firm, training in the arts of the mortician under the supervision of his father-in-law, having returned to school to gain the O-level certificates necessary to gain his professional qualifications.Wilson was and remained an unpretentious man whose nature did not permit him to feel envy for the greater acclaim and celebrity bestowed on team-mates such as Bobby Charlton, Moore and Hurst. Few men can have so thoroughly embodied the virtues and values of the post-war English professional footballer, plying his trade at a time when he and his colleagues were still recognisably members of the human race.• This article was amended on 24 May 2018. An earlier version said Ray Wilson returned from 18 months of national service and was invited to sign professional forms for Huddersfield in 1952. He signed those forms in 1955, having returned from the two years he spent in national service."

Thomas Tuchel has been confirmed as Paris Saint-Germain’s new manager on a two-year deal. The German, who has been out of work since leaving Borussia Dortmund at the end of the 2016‑17 season, will replace Unai Emery at the Parc des Princes.“It is with great joy, pride and ambition that I join this great global football club that is Paris Saint‑Germain,” Tuchel said in a statement released on Monday by PSG. “I look forward to working with all these great players, all of whom are among the best on the planet.“With my staff, we will do everything to help the team push their limits to the highest international level. There is tremendous potential in Paris and this is the most exciting challenge that has come to me.”The 44-year-old was appointed at Jürgen Klopp’s successor at Dortmund in 2015 and won the DFB-Pokal last season, but left after falling out with the club hierarchy. Before Dortmund Tuchel was in charge of Mainz for five years.The PSG president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, described Tuchel as “one of the most competitive European coaches to have emerged at the highest level in recent years”.He said: “He is strongly imbued with the principles of spectacular and clinical football that have always been at the heart of German football, especially on the international scene. His ambitious personality, his strong taste for attacking football and his strength of character are part of the style we have always sought at Paris Saint-Germain. This is the style that fans of our club have always looked for and admired.”Emery’s two-year spell in charge at the Parc des Princes will come to an end after PSG’s final game of the season at Caen on Saturday. The Spaniard led them to the Ligue 1 title this season but his side were eliminated by Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League."

A huge rise in the number of reports of sexist discrimination in football targeted at high‑profile women in the game is worrying but not surprising, according to the sport’s leading gender equality pressure group.There has been an overall increase of almost 400% in the number of reports of sex discrimination and harassment incidents received by Women in Football, with alleged abuse on social media accounting for the biggest leap.During the course of the 2017‑18 season, Women in Football claims to have received complaints from individuals across the football industry. Lewd comments of a sexual nature, racist, gendered remarks and threats of violence were reportedly made to a number of high‑profile female journalists, broadcasters, players and referees.A total of 271 incidents were reported to Women in Football during the 2017‑18 season. These alleged incidents occurred across clubs, organisations and online. Reported incidents on match days were up by 133.3%, workplace incidents by 112.5% and attacks on social media rose by 285.4%.A Women in Football spokeswoman said: “We regularly support women who face discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace, providing pro bono legal advice thanks to Mishcon de Reya. We also work closely with Prospect Union and, with the help of both, have successfully resolved numerous cases. The significant increase in the number of sexist reports received by Women in Football is of concern, but sadly not a great surprise.“What is clear is that this is just the tip of the iceberg; for every offensive tweet or comment posted and reported to us, there are dozens that aren’t. And we know from our 2016 research, that women who experience sexism at work rarely report it – just one in 10 according to our landmark industry survey.”"

Eddie Howe confirmed Bournemouth left Lewis Cook out of the squad against Burnley in anticipation of an England call-up. The 21-year-old midfielder has been involved in Gareth Southgate’s last two squads building up to the World Cup finals in Russia and made his debut against Italy in March.Howe said: “He’s had a lot of games, a lot of exposure, a lot of pressure placed upon him. We just wanted him to be free of that for a little bit longer so we sent him away, he’s abroad, to try and make sure he doesn’t suffer from burn-out maybe next season.”Asked what it would mean for Bournemouth to have a player at the World Cup with England, Howe said: “It would mean everything, not just for England but for any of our internationals. We’re very proud whenever we see our players performing for their countries. It’s the biggest stage, a prestigious event, so we obviously wish them all well.”Bournemouth finished the campaign on a winning note, with the substitute Callum Wilson netting in stoppage time to give the visitors a 2-1 victory after Josh King had cancelled out Chris Wood’s opener. The three points ensured Bournemouth finish 12th in the Premier League table, 11 points clear of the relegation zone.Howe said: “Great way to finish for us. A difficult game. First half was tough, I thought Burnley made it difficult, as they do with how they play, but for me the change in the game was the substitutes. I thought they had a big impact. Dan Gosling, Callum Wilson, Jermain Defoe really did inspire us.”A sell-out crowd flocked to Turf Moor to celebrate Burnley securing Europa League football, and Wilson’s sucker punch following a mistake by Kevin Long did not spoil the party mood. The Burnley manager, Sean Dyche, said: “Two horrible goals, that’s for sure. A couple of good saves from Popey (goalkeeper Nick Pope), other than that we weren’t really under any undue pressure. But overall it is difficult because my instinct is to be disappointed in the outcome.“But beyond that, I’ve got to register the work these players have done over a season, which has been phenomenal. The amount of effort, the amount of work, the discipline and dedication to the cause they’ve put in.”Burnley have been all but certain of finishing seventh for several weeks but have ended the season on a five-game winless run. Dyche added: “The last couple of weeks have been difficult because, whatever you think of players, there’s usually got to be some form of stimulus on the game. The players are human. That edge that you need sometimes, it feels different.”"

Arsenal manager Unai Emery – this is going to feel strange for a while, isn’t it? – will make a move for Nice’s Jean Michaël Seri, a long-time target of his predecessor. Meet the new boss, same as, etc. Heading out as Seri arrives: Danny Welbeck, who is off to Besiktas. Staying put: Aaron Ramsey, who will be encouraged to sign a new deal.Across town, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte is for the off, this is probably not breaking news to you. But it seems he’s not going to rush finding a new job if/when sacked: he’ll be taking a break instead, happy to wait for the ideal opportunity to present itself, and let Chelsea pay for his sabbatical.Conte had been linked with Napoli, but now it seems that job is going to another former Chelsea boss in Carlo Ancelotti. As Conte grabs Ancelotti’s sun lounger, current Napoli boss Maurizio Sarri could be heading for Chelsea, the loop pleasingly complete.The new West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini is getting down to business quickly. He’ll make moves for Newcastle’s Jamal Lascelles and James Tarkowski of Burnley, and sell Michail Antonio to Crystal Palace.Juventus and Napoli have joined Chelsea and Tottenham in the race for Anthony Martial, who has clearly decided it’s not worth waiting for the Jose Mourinho endgame.Also possibly leaving Old Trafford: Paul Pogba, away back to Juventus. That’s one of those rumours that seems quite surprising at first glance, but on second look isn’t really, is it?Another out-of-favour striker heading off to Serie A: Álvaro Morata, who is a target for the sort-of-resurgent Milan.Also sort-of resurgent: Rangers. They’re back! Not as a footballing force, not yet, give Steven Gerrard time, will you. But they are a renewed force in the gossip columns. They’ll be linked with Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all this summer, you see if we’re wrong: that starts today with a loan move for Liverpool starlets Ben Woodburn and Harry Wilson, and a £2m deal for Gerrard’s former team-mate Martin Skrtel, currently at Fenerbahce.And finally … Manchester City want Ajax’s John Stones upgrade Matthijs de Ligt; Swansea continue to pursue Ostersunds manager Graham Potter; and Everton defender Leighton Baines is bound for LA Galaxy."

It was overshadowed at the time by his tales of Romelu Lukaku and voodoo, late‑night calls from Jim White and Ross Barkley’s contract demands, but even now, four months on, it is staggering to recall Farhad Moshiri telling Everton’s AGM he decided to give Sam Allardyce the most important job at the club after reading the former England manager’s autobiography. No Evertonian at the Philharmonic Hall in January needed to flick through Big Sam to confirm suspicions the latest chapter would end acrimoniously and swiftly. His was a desperate and ill-judged appointment, and his removal alone will not rectify the serious drift at Goodison Park.Allardyce leaves Everton after six miserable months with his reputation as a survival specialist intact. Therein lies the failure. Everton, as the 63-year‑old admitted when installed as Ronald Koeman’s replacement in November, represented the best opportunity of his club career to shatter preconceptions about his management style.He succeeded only in confirming they were legitimate. Wretched football on a weekly basis, taking responsibility for victory while abdicating it in defeat and an arrogant dismissal of supporters were not the basis for building consensus or hope for the future. Not that the Everton hierarchy have delivered on that score.Yes, Allardyce inherited a weak squad that, one year after the costliest recruitment drive in Everton’s history – costly in every sense – is in need of major reconstruction. But it was a squad clear from relegation danger by Christmas after a seven-game unbeaten start to his reign. Allardyce had five months to implement improvements in style, performance and results while showing he was invested in Everton for the long term. He did not deliver on any count. The anaemic defeat at West Ham last Sunday, coming after the manager had given players several days off in the buildup, was a fitting farewell to an appalling season from all concerned.In fairness to those who ignored Allardyce’s unsuitability and oversaw the unpopular appointment, there was a sensible economic reason for seeking insurance when the team floundered earlier in the season. Those behind the decision were Moshiri, the then director of football, Steve Walsh, and the directors Alexander Ryazantsev and Keith Harris, who were promoted to chief finance and commercial officer and deputy chairman, respectively, on Tuesday.Everton’s unexpected regression on the pitch coincided with the club negotiating with Liverpool city council and global financial institutions for the £500m required to build a new stadium at Bramley Moore dock. The strength of Everton’s case to lenders is based, in part, on being a safe Premier League concern that has been ever-present in the top flight since 1954. This was not the season to demonstrate the fragility of that proud record by even flirting with relegation. Progress has been slow on the project that will define Moshiri’s legacy, however, when it could have strengthened the case for Allardyce’s appointment in the short term. The council is yet to sign off a proposed £280m loan that could generate a profit of £7m a year in interest for the austerity-battered authority over 25 years.Allardyce’s detractors have argued Everton were never seriously in peril and his claim to have inherited “chaos” from a caretaker manager in David Unsworth who was “struggling to cope” was part of a self-serving PR strategy. There is an element of truth to both sides. Everton were 13th but only five points above the relegation zone following Unsworth’s final game in charge, a 4-0 victory over West Ham that Allardyce shamelessly claimed as his own. That and many other erroneous boasts fuelled supporters’ antagonism as much as football devoid of joy or entertainment.One undeniable statistic favoured by the former Everton manager pinpointed his impact. Everton conceded an alarming 27 goals in the 10 games before Allardyce’s arrival (he would insist nine games on account of West Ham) but the same amount over the next 20. Defensive organisation apart, his average points return over 24 Premier League matches was almost identical to Unsworth’s over five – 1.41 per game compared with 1.4 under the club’s under-23s manager. And there was not one impressive performance among them. His tenure will be remembered instead, if at all, for attempting to bring on a defensive midfielder, Morgan Schneiderlin, at 0-0 against Watford, only to summon a striker when Troy Deeney scored what proved the winner; for being content with a point at Swansea; for having the second-lowest number of shots on target in the Premier League season; and a style of play that one rival manager branded “Conference football” following a game at Goodison.Allardyce talked frequently of planning for next season but never convinced anyone that Everton was anything other than one brief, lucrative and possibly final job. He was up against it from the start in that respect. Moshiri initially offered him a six-month contract having been unable to prise Marco Silva from Watford. It took five weeks, culminating in a 5-1 home defeat by Atalanta and a 4-1 loss at Southampton in the space of four calamitous days, before the major shareholder bowed to Allardyce’s demands for an 18-month deal without a break clause. The manager would become a magnet for disenchantment among supporters fed mediocrity under Bill Kenwright’s ownership and now a lack of vision on the pitch under Moshiri. But Allardyce was emblematic of a deeper malaise at Everton, one the club’s board have to correct this summer.The club exposed Allardyce to ridicule with the survey that asked club members to rate his performance on a scale of zero to 10. It may have been a wide-ranging survey, it may have been a repeat of last year’s exercise under Koeman, but its publication this year, when Allardyce was regularly being told where to go during away games, reflected the leadership vacuum in a business getting the small details wrong.The Monaco-based Moshiri is expected to acquire a majority stake in Everton soon and can ill-afford his third managerial failure with the team regressing from the top six and the stadium vision yet to take shape. The rate of change occurring at Goodison is recognition of the need for improvement. PSV Eindhoven’s technical director, Marcel Brands, has been appointed as the new director of football in place of Walsh, who presided over a disastrous recruitment policy and will leave. The deputy chief executive, Denise Barrett‑Baxendale, has been confirmed as Robert Elstone’s replacement, with the chief executive switching sports to Super League after 13 years. The growing influence of Harris and Ryazantsev behind the scenes was also recognised in Tuesday’s executive restructure.That leaves the not insignificant matters of a stadium finance deal and a fourth management team in eight months to be resolved. Everton are relieved of Allardyce but in many respects are also back to square one."

Neale Cooper, one of Aberdeen’s European Cup Winners’ Cup heroes, has died after being found injured outside his home, the club have confirmed.Cooper, who was 54, was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the early hours of Sunday but lost his fight for life on Monday afternoon.Aberdeen wrote on their Twitter account: “The club is deeply shocked and saddened to hear that our legendary midfielder and Gothenburg Great, Neale Cooper has tragically passed away.”Police Scotland earlier confirmed officers had been called to a report of a man who had collapsed within a communal stairwell in the Ferguson Court area of Bucksburn at around 1.45am on Sunday.Detective Inspector David Howieson said: “Police inquiries have been ongoing throughout the night to establish the full circumstances. However, the incident does not appear to be suspicious.”Police appealed for the driver of a black people carrier taxi, which picked up Cooper along with another man and two women at about 12.30am on Sunday at Union Street, to contact them.Cooper was in Sir Alex Ferguson’s team which beat Real Madrid 2-1 in Gothenburg in May 1983 before overcoming Hamburg later that year to clinch the European Super Cup.He also won two league winners’ medals following the Dons’ championship triumphs of 1984 and 1985, while he won the Scottish Cup four times and League Cup once.The combative midfielder also played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading – although injury hampered his progress at all three clubs – and had a second spell with the Dons.He rediscovered his form and fitness at Dunfermline and Ross County before managing the latter team and also Hartlepool, Gillingham and Peterhead.He had been working for Saltire Energy and attended a 35th anniversary gathering of the Cup Winners’ Cup triumph with his former team-mates earlier this month. Cooper’s former teams and colleagues expressed their shock as the news broke.Another Gothenburg Great, Neil Simpson, wrote on Twitter: “Devastated&heartbroken. Will miss your cheeky smile, infectious laugh, Fergie impressions, all the dressing room stories & your friendship. Loved playing alongside you. Taken too soon. Thoughts with your Mum and all your lovely family x RIP Neale “Tattie” Cooper Never forgotten x”Ross County said: “We are deeply saddened to hear that Neale Cooper passed away earlier today. Our sincere sympathy and heartfelt condolences go out to the family at this difficult time. RIP Neale.”Hartlepool stated that everyone at the club was “absolutely devastated” to hear the news, adding: “Our thoughts and sincere condolences are with his family and friends at this time. We are heartbroken.”"

About 1,000 Liverpool fans who were planning to travel to Ukraine for Saturday’s Champions League final have been left stranded after three flights to the country were cancelled.The specialist tour operator Worldchoice Sports cut the flights after controllers at Boryspil airport, 29kms outside the capital Kiev, could not allocate landing slots for the three planes due to leave the UK on Friday and Saturday.In a statement on its website, the company said: “We have exhausted all avenues to try and get landing slots. We have had them from Liverpool airport and Manchester airport and we have applied for slots in the correct manner and timeframe with the authorities. To reiterate this problem IS with Kiev.”Liverpool FC is expecting over 20,000 supporters to travel to the eastern European city ahead of Saturday’s match in Kiev’s Olimpiyskiy stadium against defending champions Real Madrid.The club told supporters: “Along with officials from Liverpool John Lennon airport, Liverpool city council, Uefa and the authorities in Kiev, Liverpool FC has been endeavouring to resolve the issue since it first came to light and will continue to do so until all avenues have been exhausted.”On Thursday night Liverpool’s mayor, Joe Anderson, claimed to have found landing spots for two of the planes after working with his Kiev counterpart – the former professional boxer and the mayor of the Ukrainian capital, Vitali Klitschko.Today I worked with .@Vitaliy_Klychko to help and negotiate with the Director of the Airport in Kiev two slots for aircraft booked by World Choice Sports to arrive at 3.00 pm and 3.45 pm. What happens next is up to this company to sort and hopefully they can for all.However, an update on the tour operator’s website stressed that they had only been able to secure one replacement flight for Friday.In a statement online they told customers: “We have managed to get a three-night flight secured very late in the day. We are currently offering people booked on the two-night stay the opportunity to use this.“Despite some reports in the media this afternoon this is the only flight we have been able to secure.” Liverpool’s chief executive, Peter Moore, said those involved in the dispute were “optimistic” that fans who booked with the flight operator would be able to travel to the Champions League final on Saturday night.We have been working with Kiev Airport, Liverpool Airport, Liverpool City Council, UEFA, World Choice and the aircraft broker over the past 48 hours to find a solution to this issue. Work is ongoing, and we are optimistic that together will obtain a favourable resolution. https://t.co/NgFlTTFgg5"

Jack Ross is set to become Sunderland’s manager, with confirmation of his move south from St Mirren expected by Thursday evening.Stewart Donald, who completed his takeover of the League One club on Monday, is confident of securing the highly rated 41-year-old as Chris Coleman’s replacement. Only a late hijack on the part of the Championship side Ipswich Town seems capable of derailing the deal.St Mirren announced on Wednesday they had received a formal approach from Sunderland for Ross’s services and had “reluctantly” granted permission for talks.Soon afterwards Donald tweeted: “We’ve agreed terms with our man and it’s with the legals now. By close of play tomorrow I would hope to make an announcement. All on course.”Confusion reigned earlier in the day when Gordon Scott, the chairman of the newly promoted Scottish Premiership side, voiced annoyance with Donald for allegedly breaching protocol by speaking to Ross behind his back.It was perhaps unwise of Sunderland’s new owner to tell a radio interviewer: “We’ve agreed terms – literally this morning, we’re just drawing up contracts – with the man we want. The man in question is absolutely thrilled.”Ross led St Mirren to promotion in his first full campaign in charge. The Scot’s work while winning the Championship north of the border has attracted admirers and last week he held “advanced talks” with Ipswich over their vacancy.Although St Mirren made him an improved offer, it is understood the remuneration package offered by the Wearside club relegated from the Premier League only 12 months ago, will at least quadruple his salary.A journeyman utility player turned highly innovative coach, Ross holds an MA in economics from Edinburgh’s Heriot-Watt University.Previously in charge of Alloa Athletic, he helped St Mirren avoid relegation in 2016-17 before masterminding this season’s promotion, rejecting an approach from Barnsley along the way.“There’s been no contact from Sunderland so, unless there’s been some major skulduggery, then it’s nonsense,” said Scott on Tuesday morning before receiving the official approach. It is thought St Mirren will receive around £50,000 in compensation."

Welcome to theguardian.com review of the 2017-18 Premier League season. We have nominated some contenders for this category but this is just to get the discussion going: offer your suggestions below the line …It is frightening to think Manchester City are yet to reap the rewards of the winger in his prime. He is an increasingly valuable commodity in the best and most expensive team in the country. His devilish left foot and chicane sprints gives the meanest defenders a hopeless conundrum and his manager the same, for these days it is almost impossible to leave Sané out of the starting lineup. At times he has struggled for consistency but he has added more goals and established himself as another go-to star. If the German can produce his best this summer, he will light up the World Cup.For Liverpool, the road to Kiev began in earnest on an August evening on the outskirts of Sinsheim. It was there the then 18-year-old scored his first goal for the club he joined aged six, a low, fizzing free-kick against Hoffenheim in the Champions League play-off first leg. That set the bar high for what has been a brilliant season for a player who has relished the responsibility of assuming and then retaining Nathaniel Clyne’s right-back berth. He is not without flaws; badly exposed by Marcus Rashford and Wilfried Zaha and more recently targeted by Roma at the Stadio Olimpico. But Jürgen Klopp has continued to trust him – especially in the biggest matches – and Alexander-Arnold continues to rise to the challenge.After lifting the World Cup with England Under-20s last summer, the midfielder had only one minor gripe: he wanted to play more. Now the 21-year-old should be heralded as part of a new-look Bournemouth core, along with the classy Nathan Aké in defence and Asmir Begovic in goal. For Cook, a savvy operator, primarily a passer but also a fearless tackler, this season has been his breakthrough. Watching Jack Wilshere at close quarters last season was beneficial, as his manager Eddie Howe said recently. Cook made history in March after becoming the first Bournemouth player to represent England and clearly has a huge future.It feels as though he has been around forever but Alli turned 22 only last month. He has struggled to attain last season’s dizzying heights but in any other industry he would still be regarded as a young man. By his own admission, Alli has not been at his best but has still proved a serial influencer alongside Harry Kane at Tottenham. He has been clattered and man-marked but it is what he offers that still leaves the most lasting mark. His manager’s faith in him has been unwavering and it was only a couple of months ago that Mauricio Pochettino reiterated his belief that Alli is the world’s best, at his age. The noise around Alli in 2016-17 was not hyperbole and his ability to still produce the utterly divine means he remains in a glowing minority.José Mourinho’s tough love, if you will, does not seem to have struck a chord with the 20-year-old and really it is no surprise he has struggled to produce his best. Glimpses of grace have been enough to whet the appetite for the long-term view, though, while the arrival of Alexis Sánchez has undoubtedly been detrimental to the immediate development of a player who has shown he is still raw in areas. His double in the win over Liverpool offered his manager a timely reminder of his quality at club level but arguably his best displays have been for England. Like Alli, the England forward will feel he has much to show in Russia.The cardboard sign with the words “Jesus, new Pelé” in permanent marker may still seem a bit excessive but it is difficult to look beyond the extraordinary success the Manchester City striker has enjoyed. Injuries were expected to inhibit his involvement but he has twice recovered rapidly to spearhead the attack, at times relegating Sergio Agüero to a bit-part role. The 21-year-old has tasted defeat in the Premier League only once since joining from Palmeiras in August 2016 – against Manchester United last month – and this season he has scored a goal every 130 minutes. When Pep Guardiola described Sané, Jesus and Raheem Sterling as “the future”, surely even he cannot have predicted it would look this good."

Goalkeeper: Sam Johnstone (Aston Villa) This was his 10th loan from Manchester United but game time allowed the 25-year-old to shine, including preposterous saves against Cardiff and Wolves. Only John Ruddy kept more clean sheets than his 22. Right-back: Ryan Fredericks (Fulham) His athleticism was key in transforming defence into attack. Brimming with energy, he has been a three-in-one figurine, adventurous and efficient in both boxes; a modern touchline-hugging full-back. Centre-back: Conor Coady (Wolves) After being used at right-back and defensive midfield, Coady has flourished at sweeper in a back three. Monstrous in defence and capable in attack.Centre-back: Sean Morrison (Cardiff City) Neil Warnock has waxed lyrical about Sol Bamba but alongside the Ivorian his captain has been the bedrock of success. Six goals since February helped them clinch promotion too.Left-back: Barry Douglas (Wolves) It is impossible to look beyond the flying Scotsman who, amid the lavish spending, has excelled since a €750,000 move from Konyaspor. Deadly from dead balls, the assist-king proved a bargain. Centre-midfield: Rúben Neves (Wolves) The 21-year-old has oozed class, picking passes for fun and racking up a stunning catalogue of strikes, notably that 35-yard volley against Derby. Centre-midfield: Kevin McDonald (Fulham) The anchorman in Slavisa Jokanovic’s three-man midfield and Fulham would not be the same without him. The streetwise Scot allowed Tom Cairney and Stefan Johansen to thrive.Right wing: Harry Wilson (Hull City) The 21-year-old made a big splash in 14 matches on loan from Liverpool, scoring seven goals. Robert Snodgrass and Junior Hoilett did damage but Wilson singlehandedly lit up a miserable Hull campaign.Attacking midfield: James Maddison (Norwich City) An export from Coventry’s revered academy, he has shimmered in his first full Championship season. Showcased delicate footwork, intricate passing and a knack for the spectacular. Left wing: Ryan Sessegnon (Fulham) His hurtling shuttles have drawn comparisons to Gareth Bale and Marcelo but Sessegnon’s nose for the net (16 goals) is his USP. Capped the season with a cute assist at Wembley.Striker: Bobby Reid (Bristol City) The academy graduate relished the responsibility of leading the line after being pushed further forward by Lee Johnson. A relentless runner, the 25-year-old’s transformation has been seamless.Subs John Ruddy, Darnell Fisher, Ryan Woods, Tom Cairney, Junior Hoilett, Aleksandar Mitrovic, Lewis GrabbanManager: Neil Warnock (Cardiff City) The marmite Yorkshireman produced his best trick yet in steering Cardiff to the Premier League. A magician when it comes to building team spirit and revitalising also-rans. Goalkeeper: Dean Henderson (Shrewsbury Town) The rapport between the Manchester United loanee and Salop supporters speaks volumes. England Under-21 international made stunning saves look simple – another at Wembley last Sunday. Right-back: Josh Emmanuel (Rotherham United) Another loanee who has relished regular game time, the 20-year-old showed pace and power in abundance. Will fancy his chances of breaking in at Ipswich next season.Centre-back: Toto Nsiala (Shrewsbury) Has had a bumpy ride to becoming a mainstay – he was released by Everton before a stint in Vietnam – but proved a calming presence alongside Omar Beckles.Centre-back: Chey Dunkley (Wigan Athletic) A pillar of the division’s meanest defence – they shut out Manchester City – he has stood out since arriving on a free from Oxford United.Left-back: Charlie Mulgrew (Blackburn Rovers) The versatile captain has shone in the heart of Tony Mowbray’s backline. Scored 14 goals – six penalties – with his left foot, more than any other defender in the country.Centre-midfield: Graham Carey (Plymouth Argyle) Plymouth’s pearl for the past couple of years, the Irishman has enjoyed another stellar season, helping the club to the verge of the play-offs.Centre-midfield: Bradley Dack (Blackburn) Scooped no fewer than 10 awards in his first season since a £750,000 switch from Gillingham. At last has a chance to prove himself in Championship.Centre-midfield: Nick Powell (Wigan Athletic) Has displayed much of the promise that led Sir Alex Ferguson to talk him up as Paul Scholes’s successor at Old Trafford. An elegant operator, fancied by Brighton.Striker: Brett Pitman (Portsmouth) A serial goalscorer and shrewd summer signing by Kenny Jackett. Hit 23 league goals despite niggling injuries. Striker: Jack Marriott (Peterborough United) Few players’ stock is higher than the 33-goal striker. A revelation since joining from Luton last June, and Posh are resigned to losing their prized asset, a player farmed out to Woking in 2015. Striker: Will Grigg (Wigan Athletic) Followed up making his mark via Northern Ireland supporters’ song with only five league goals in 2016-17. But after conjuring up a good relationship with Powell, has been reborn under manager Paul Cook. Subs: David Raya, Dan Burn, Ben Godfrey, Will Vaulks, Erhun Oztumer, Danny GrahamManager: Paul Hurst (Shrewsbury) Guided a team tipped for relegation to the brink of the Championship. Deservedly given a chance to manage higher after signing a three-year deal at Ipswich.Goalkeeper: Marek Stech (Luton Town) Kept 15 clean sheets after leaving Sparta Prague to sign for his former Yeovil Town team-mate Nathan Jones. A gentle giant but also one of Luton’s leaders.Right-back: Jack Stacey (Luton) Another impressive season after starring on loan at Exeter in 2016-17. The 22-year-old former Reading trainee caught the eye with marauding, overlapping runs.Centre-back: Mark Hughes (Accrington Stanley) One half of a watertight partnership alongside Jimmy Dunne, the captain played every minute of their title-winning campaign to help the team to the joint-best defensive record.Centre-back: Adam El-Abd (Wycombe Wanderers) The 33-year-old is settled after a difficult couple of years since leaving boyhood club Brighton. By his own admission, one of a “number of captains” in Gareth Ainsworth’s squad.Left-back: Tom James (Yeovil Town) The reliable Welshman made 51 appearances in his breakthrough season. Former Cardiff trainee, 22, could be the latest to depart for a bigger fish.Centre-midfield: Jorge Grant (Notts County) Joined Nottingham Forest in 2013 via Reading and the Nike Academy. His most recent move, across the Trent, has been his most prosperous, though, with Grant regularly grasping centre stage.Centre-midfield: Tom Bayliss (Coventry City) Coventry’s next big thing, the teenager, who joined aged 12, looks set to follow a well-trodden path. Dancing feet, daring and direct, he made his full debut in December.Centre-midfield: Sean McConville (Accrington) Part of the team that missed automatic promotion by one goal in 2016 and a key cog in getting over the line this time. John Coleman demanded more end product and he delivered.Striker: Billy Kee (Accrington) Kee finished as the division’s top scorer after an extraordinary year. Has spoken powerfully about his struggles off the pitch but excelled on it.Striker: Mohamed Eisa (Cheltenham Town) A year on from giving Ryman South defenders the runaround, Eisa is one of the Football League’s most prolific strikers. The Sudan-born striker got 25 goals in his first season as a professional.Striker: Marc McNulty (Coventry) Persuaded by Michael Doyle, Coventry’s captain, to join, McNulty scored 28 goals after a stuttering start. Unselfish and savvy.Subs: Aaron Chapman, Dan Potts, Luke O’Nien, Sammie Szmodics, Jayden Stockley, Christian DoidgeManager: John Coleman (Accrington) There is an argument that the ebullient scouser’s achievements put Pep Guardiola’s success in the shade. Promotion was a magnificent reward for his hard-working side."

Two of the division’s form teams meet on the final day, with the occasion little more than a celebration of the two managers. Roy Hodgson’s feat in steering Crystal Palace to safety, despite a chronic injury crisis, having been pointless in mid-October has been remarkable. Darren Moore, even only in his capacity as a caretaker, has mustered 11 points from five matches, claimed the manager of the month award for April and endured relegation on Tuesday. The hope – and it is only a hope as yet – is he is given a chance to take up the reins on a permanent basis.

Jürgen Klopp said Liverpool “wanted everything and got minus nothing” in Kiev as their Champions League final dreams died with a serious injury to Mohamed Salah and two dreadful goalkeeping mistakes from Loris Karius. Both players were reduced to tears while Real Madrid celebrated a third consecutive Champions League triumph.Salah left the Olimpiyskiy Stadium with his left shoulder in a sling having been forced out of the final in the 30th minute following a challenge by Sergio Ramos. Klopp described Ramos’s challenge as “harsh”, with the Real captain holding Salah’s arm as he dragged him to the ground, and admitted the Egypt international could miss the World Cup. Liverpool’s leading scorer was taken to hospital after the game while the squad flew home to Merseyside.“It was a big moment in the game,” said Klopp, who congratulated Zinedine Zidane’s team on their victory. “I know if you say something like that after you’ve lost, you sound like a bad loser. But for me that was kind of a harsh challenge because the arm is there and it was like wrestling a little bit.“It was very bad for Mo, very bad for us, very bad for Egypt. That’s part of the sport I don’t like, but things like this can happen. I don’t know what would have happened had Mo played on, we will never know that. Everybody saw in the first half-hour we were the opponent they probably will have expected. We played good football but we lost 3-1 so I don’t think in 10 years people will talk about that. The other decisive moments were the goals. They were quite strange.”Salah’s injury was not the only decisive moment to go against Liverpool. Karius handed Karim Benzema the opening goal and, while he could do nothing about Gareth Bale’s stunning overhead kick, he also let a shot from the Wales international slip through his grasp.Karius spoke to Talksport after the game: “I don’t feel anything right now. Today I lost my team the game and I feel sorry for everyone. I’m sorry for everyone - from the team, from the whole club - that the mistakes cost dearly.“If I could go back in time, I would. I feel sorry for my team,” he continued. “I know I let them down today. It’s very hard right now but that’s the life of a goalkeeper. You have to get your head up again. These goals cost us the title, basically.”Karius apologised to Liverpool fans in the stadium after the final whistle and, though few of his team-mates offered consolation on the pitch, Klopp insisted the club would stand by the young German.“I have only had very few words after the game,” the manager said. “It’s really hard for him and I really feel for him. Nobody wants that. The mistakes were obvious. We don’t have to talk about them. He knows it, I know it, you all know it. Now he has to deal with it, we have to deal with it and we will do that. We will be with him, no doubt about that. It was not his night, obviously.”The defeat was Klopp’s sixth consecutive cup final defeat and he said Salah’s injury made the latest all the more painful. He explained: “I am not fine. I’m the opposite of fine. I have lost games in my life before so I know how to deal with that but you cannot avoid the feeling the night after the game. We all feel really, really bad and the trip home will not be the best trip we’ve ever had in our lives.“We wanted everything and got minus something with the injury of Mo. We didn’t win the final, we lost a very important player and Egypt maybe lost a very important player for the World Cup. I hope it’s not like this. I have no idea exactly but the medical department … what they said so far it doesn’t look really good.”"

Cesc Fàbregas will have an extra incentive to claim the FA Cup for a second time in his career after admitting he has mislaid his winner’s medal from his first appearance in the final, with Arsenal 13 years ago.The Spain midfielder had just turned 18 when he started for Arsène Wenger’s team in the goalless draw with Manchester United at the Millennium Stadium. Fàbregas had relished his tussle with imposing opponents, who included Roy Keane in their number, before being replaced by Robin van Persie four minutes from the end of normal time, then watched Patrick Vieira convert the decisive spot-kick in the subsequent penalty shootout to claim the trophy with his final touch in an Arsenal shirt.Yet Fàbregas – who has since gone on to claim two Premier Leagues with Chelsea, La Liga and the Copa del Rey with Barcelona, and the World Cup and two European Championships with Spain, has admitted his medal for the first major silverware of his senior career has since been lost. “This one, I cannot find it,” he said. “My dad used to keep my medals and, once I’d grown up, I said to him: ‘Listen, where are all my medals and stuff?’“He’d nearly lost the World Cup one even but I found that in a box in my mum’s house. I have nearly all of them but I’ve lost two or three, including the FA Cup one. I hope, on Saturday, I will have a new one to keep. I remember that final back in 2005 in a special way. It was my first big trophy as a professional, and at a very young age. We played really badly, to be honest. We were lucky. I can say that now. But I remember kicking Keane in a one-on-one, winning that and getting away because he was on the floor. And Patrick scoring the winner … a nice moment. Good celebrations.”There has been precious little to celebrate this season at Chelsea, with the team’s title defence petering out early and Champions League qualification proving elusive. Yet securing the FA Cup, at the expense of José Mourinho’s United, would provide some consolation going into another summer of change at Stamford Bridge.“To go and win a trophy is not that easy,” said Fàbregas, who enters the last year of his contract at the club this summer. “In the Champions League, we played Barcelona, one of the top teams in the world. In the FA Cup, we have done well. In the league, we should have done better. We were not consistent enough in our performances. This is on us as players.“We should have put it right when we had the chance to. We didn’t and we paid for it. It is a big disappointment, I’m sure for the club as well, because they want to be and are used to being in the Champions League every year. All we can do now is go on, win the final and give the fans a good end of the season.“The FA Cup is seen as one of the big trophies. Everyone talks about the Champions League, the World Cup, the Euros, but I think if you are a bit of a romantic, the FA Cup is always very special. We have to value being in the final, we have to appreciate that, and know that if we win, we are winning a special trophy.”"

The Ferdinand-Gerrard-Lampard axis has carried BT Sport through its Champions League campaign in some style, and though it will presumably be hoping that Gerrard’s decision to dip his toe into managerial waters ends with Nevillesque haste, it has so far retained the more essential duo. Lampard also has plans to move into management, but in the meantime approaches his commentating duties with diligence and speaks with confidence and authority.Radio commentators are inevitably less noticeable than those who work on television, partly because we never see their faces and partly because we often give the television our undivided attention but listen to the radio only while driving and/or being loudly instructed by other members of the family to turn on something more interesting instead, ideally involving Camila Cabello. But Nevin is always a good listen and earned additional respect after revealing this year that he was once accosted by a knife-wielding football fan and used a flying fist and the winger’s familiar turn of pace to make good his escape, leaving him only a few rungs below Spider-Man on the crime-fighting ladder.Since retiring as a player in 2011 Neville has never been absent from this list and his glorious run is not about to end. It remains puzzling that no rival broadcaster has sought to copy the format that makes the first 50 minutes of Monday Night Football so compelling and illuminating, but though he has started to focus a little too much on furiously criticising footballers whom he spots walking, often but not always Mesut Özil, he remains enlightening before and during matches.If there were an award for most improved pundit, Ian Wright would take it. There was a time when he appeared to believe his brand of matey bonhomie was all it would take to indefinitely earn a living out of punditry, and that an absence of actual analysis would go unnoticed amid all the joshing, chuckling and unexpected use of flat caps. This was very much the tactic also used by Alan Shearer, only he stripped away the geniality and headwear to leave something that was neither animated nor insightful nor thermally insulated. Both have managed to reinvent themselves, and Wright – who has never previously been mentioned in our review, not even mockingly – is now something of an up-and-comer.Curmudgeonly and over-opinionated, Sutton operates as if having consciously decided that the fastest and surest way of standing out amid a heaving morass of aspiring pundits was to aggressively irritate everyone. Sutton has a particular shtick, and it is not to everybody’s liking. Thus when the Mirror ranked every television football pundit in regular action earlier this season, Sutton was at No 37 (out of 39, one place ahead of Garth Crooks and two above Michael Owen). He is, in his way, like a cut-price Robbie Savage, only without the preening narcissism. However, I find him entertaining. So there. “I watch a lot of TV and find some of it extremely tedious and boring because people don’t want to say the things they should be saying,” Sutton says. “I am not always right, but I think it is important to have an opinion.” It certainly helps.The leaf miner moth presents a serious threat to that most beloved of British trees, the horse chestnut. These tiny mites have attacked one particular breed of tree and done so with such cruel efficiency that it has rendered the future of conkers in Britain tragically uncertain. Meanwhile ash dieback is a fungus that attacks its prey with savage speed, killing juvenile trees with the efficiency of an assassin. In the 1970s Dutch elm disease destroyed millions of elms across the country. So if it can happen to trees, what if some foreign critter crept into the country undetected and started to attack football pundits? Granted, this is scientifically impossible, but go with me here. Let’s say that, as soon as the problem was identified, a house was built within a totally safe exclusion zone but only big enough to house one pundit’s ego. Who would you put inside? I would unhesitatingly send in Souness, whose tactical acumen is strong, who hands out praise and condemnation with even-handed sense and whose range of exasperated facial expressions is second to none."

Another success for Diego Simeone and Atlético, and another success for Spain in the Europa League. Eight of the past nine winners of European competitions have been Spanish – and Real Madrid could made it nine out of 10 in Kiev next week.La Liga has also provided nine winners of the Europa League in the past 15 years and this was a third in nine seasons for Atlético, two of them under Simeone – although he was confined to the stands after he was sent from the touchline during the first leg of the semi-final against Arsenal.It was not a final that will live long in the memory. Atlético played as they tend to at their best, holding their opponents at arm’s length, spoiling when they need to, and winning comfortably without really seeming to extend themselves. Marseille gifted them the first and were not without blame for the second, while the third was the result of a smart counter against weary opponents. The first two also involved ruthless finishes from Antoine Griezmann.The boyhood Marseille fan is likely to leave Atlético for Barcelona in the summer, which perhaps leaves a bittersweet note, but Atlético are familiar enough by now with the selling-on reality.There is much sniffiness about the Europa League but there is a sense in its later stages that it is what the European Cup used to be. These are big clubs but not superclubs, teams crafted through careful work in the transfer market rather than epic splurges every summer, teams for whom success is not a given, a privilege of rank, but must be scrapped for and is perhaps appreciated rather more as a result. And Atlético, as Rudi Garcia pointed out, are bigger than his Marseille side, far more experienced in major games.“This season was a tough one,” said Simeone, “but this Europa League represents more than the Europa League trophy – it shows the value of hard work and persistence, or keeping at it and working hard. We lost two Champions League finals [in the recent past]. We didn’t start the Champions League very well [this time] but reinvented ourselves in this competition. All that hard work will bear fruit in the end.”And let nobody suggest to Marseille fans the Europa League does not matter. In the stands, their white shirts outnumbered the red-and-white of Atlético by around three to one. They were noisy and raucous and before a kick-off delayed by the overrunning of the pre-match entertainment, set off dozens of red flares, swaddling the arena in thick smoke that lingered for most of the game – certainly for longer than Marseille’s hope of success. Valère Germain missed a great early chance after being slipped in by Dimitri Payet but after that Atlético were rarely threatened.With German Burgos, promoted to a starring role because of Simeone’s touchline ban, glowering from the edge of the technical area, Atlético slowly squeezed the life out of Marseille. Burgos is also a former Atlético goalkeeper and, like Simeone, seems to embody the club’s self-image. He ended his first Madrid derby spattered with blood after saving a Luis Figo penalty with his nose, and was the front man for a rock band called The Garb. In 2003, he was diagnosed with cancer but survived.A mulleted, bearded barrel of a man, he paced back and forth with an oddly lethargic gait, pointing and shrugging, hands flicking from his hips to sweep through his still lustrous dark hair. Vitally, his frustrated gesticulations got Atlético pressing high enough to disrupt Marseille as they sought to pass out from the back. That induced the opener as Steve Mandanda played an awkward ball to the holding midfielder André Zambo Anguissa who miscontrolled. With the two centre-backs split, Gabi could not have had an easier pass to play in Griezmann for a straightforward finish.Worse followed for Marseille as they lost Payet to what appeared to be a tweaked groin just after the half-hour. It later emerged he had broken the cardinal superstition and had touched the trophy on his way on to the field. He was in tears as he left the pitch and received a consolatory hug and kiss on the cheek from Griezmann, his France team-mate.The possibility of a Marseille comeback was significantly diminished four minutes into the second half, moreover, with Griezmann sending a bouncing ball infield for Koke, whose return pass found a gaping hole between the centre-back Adil Rami and the full-back Jordan Amavi. Griezmann ran on and deftly clipped his shot over Mandanda.In an age in which it can seem as though no lead is ever truly safe, there is a welcome solidity to Atlético. There was a minor scare as the substitute Kostas Mitroglou headed against a post but no Simeone side were ever going to give up a two-goal lead. Gabi’s slick third merely confirmed what had long seemed inevitable."

Andrés Iniesta praised the club and fans as he bid an emotional farewell to Barcelona after 22 years at the Nou Camp. The La Liga champions, Barça, claimed a 1-0 win over Real Sociedad and it was a fitting finale for the 34-year-old, who lifted the trophy for a ninth time.Addressing supporters on the pitch after the final whistle, Iniesta said he “leaves as a man”, having spent so long playing for the Catalan giants. “I will move on and carry you all in my heart forever,” he said in quotes published on Marca.“It’s been a wonderful 22 years, full of pride, and it’s been a pleasure to represent this club. I thank you for all the love and respect that you’ve given me since I arrived as a child. I now leave as a man.”Barcelona’s manager, Ernesto Valverde, felt it was only right to give the midfielder the send-off he got by replacing him late in the game with Paco Alcacer. “We wanted to compete and win but today was Andrés’s day and the crowd made it special,” Valverde told Barca TV.“I wanted to change things at the end of the game, to coincide with Leo [Messi] on the field. It was the right moment. These types of players will be talked about long into the future. They are unrepeatable, historical players that everyone will remember.”Iniesta received a hug from all of his team-mates as his 669-game career at Barcelona came to an emotional end as he passed his captain’s armband on to Messi.Philippe Coutinho’s goal eight minutes into the second half was the perfect way to end Barcelona’s season in style.The Brazil international had possession on the left-hand side just outside Sociedad’s penalty box and after cutting inside on to his right foot, he curled the ball past the goalkeeper, Miguel Angel Moya.Fernando Torres brought the curtain down on his Atlético Madrid career with two goals but it was not to be a victorious farewell as Eibar earned a 2-2 draw.Captaining a second-string Atlético side playing four days on from their Europa League final success against Marseille in Lyon, Torres soon cancelled out Kike Garcia’s 35th-minute opener just before the break.He rolled back the years with a fantastic run and delicate finish to score on the hour but his team-mate Lucas Hernandez was sent off three minutes later and Atlético had to battle on with 10 men.Eibar quickly made their numerical advantage count, with Ruben Pena hammering in a long-range strike to equalise with 20 minutes remaining.Torres was denied a dream ending when an offside flag ruled out another effort and the striker finished his career for his boyhood club with 128 goals in 404 matches over two spells.Earlier on Sunday goals from Simone Zaza and Gonçalo Guedes gave Valencia a 2-1 win over already relegated Deportivo La Coruna.Espanyol’s strong finish to the campaign continued with a final-day victory at Athletic Bilbao. David Lopez struck the only goal of the game after nine minutes as the Barcelona club concluded with a fourth win in a five-match unbeaten run.In Italy SPAL and Cagliari saved themselves from the possibility of relegation with final-day victories, meaning a return to Serie B for Crotone.Crotone had to win to have any chance of survival and then hope other results went their way but neither option materialised. Goals from Arkadiusz Milik and Jose Callejon put second-placed Napoli in control before Marco Tumminello’s late reply for the Calabrian side.Two goals from Mirco Antenucci and another by Alberto Grassi saw SPAL take command against Sampdoria, helped by a red card for the visiting forward Gianluca Caprari. Dawid Kownacki pulled one back for Sampdoria but SPAL were 3-1 winners.Luca Ceppitelli struck three minutes from time as Cagliari defeated Atalanta, who still finished seventh and qualified for the Europa League as Fiorentina were thrashed 5-1 by AC Milan at the San Siro.Milan wrapped up a Europa League group stage place at the end of Gennaro Gattuso’s first season in charge. Hakan Calhanoglu quickly equalised after Giovanni Simeone’s 20th-minute opener before further goals from Patrick Cutrone (2), Nikola Kalinic and Giacomo Bonaventura."

Jurgen Klopp wanted them to play brave, big balls football – and they did, dominating the match until Mo Salah’s heartbreaking injury after half an hour.

The situation with Ramos and Mo – that looks really bad, and it was a shock for the team. We lost our positive momentum. Half-time, came in, and then what can I say about the goals. We scored one, they scored three, that’s the result.“Mo’s World Cup place is in doubt. He would have played on if he could. I think he’s in hospital at the moment having an X-ray. It doesn’t look good.“What can I say? Loris knows it, everybody knows it. It’s a shame in a game like this and after a season like this. I really feel for him; he’s a fantastic boy. I think the second mistake is because of the first one. It’s really difficult to get rid of the bad thoughts in your mind. “Bale’s goal was unbelievable. We did what we could, the boys tried everything. It was not the best script for us tonight. I know [we had a great campaign] but I can’t feel it. You go to a final to win it, and if you don’t you feel like you failed. It was a proper chance for us tonight and we didn’t take it. There’s nothing else to say.”

I’m not really sure what happened with the first goal or whether it should have been allowed. It’s not about Loris Karius and the mistakes he might have made; it’s about the team. I’m so proud of the players and the fans. I hope we can keep going and get into more finals.”

Pep Guardiola is monitoring Ajax’s highly rated 18-year-old defender Matthijs de Ligt as a potential long-term replacement for Vincent Kompany.De Ligt fits the profile of a young, technically astute defender who could slot into City’s playing style. The centre-back is experienced at the highest level, having started last May’s Europa League final defeat by Manchester United in Stockholm. De Ligt also played the whole of Netherland’s 1-0 defeat by England in Amsterdam in March and, in total, has made 34 appearances in all competitions this season. That follows last year’s debut campaign that featured 22 games, including an international debut in a World Cup qualifier against Bulgaria.It is understood that before deciding to firm up his interest in the player, Guardiola will assess how much game time De Ligt may get given he already has Nicolas Otamendi, John Stones, Aymeric Laporte and Kompany as frontline centre-backs.Despite a strong finish to the season, Kompany managed to play in only eight of City’s final 14 games due to the fragility of his physique and he remains an ongoing injury concern for Guardiola. The captain is also entering the final year of his contract and, while he may be considered for an extension, there are no guarantees.Speaking about Kompany’s future earlier this week, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, City’s chairman, said: “I know how hard it’s been for him physically but also mentally. But he’s a leader with an unbelievable personality to handle these challenges. The way he’s come back, the last two months of the season, he’s been arguably the best defender in the world.”"

Ryan Sessegnon turns 18 on Friday. Not old enough to get a tattoo, but old enough to face the muscular men of the Championship, arms mostly covered in legally obtained ink, 47 times. Sessegnon notched up his half‑century in all competitions for the season in Fulham’s play-off semi‑final first leg 1-0 defeat at Derby, and his season might not nearly be over yet: he has an outside chance of being named in England’s World Cup squad on Wednesday.It is a lot to take for a kid, and watching Sessegnon in the last few weeks of a gruelling season, it’s tricky not to come to the conclusion that it all might be a bit too much, too soon. Sessegnon was substituted after an ineffective performance against Derby, similar to Fulham’s last few games of the regular season.This, it should be made clear, is nothing like a criticism. To physically and mentally get through a season in this most bruising of divisions is tough enough for even experienced souls, but to try it when you are legally still a child seems almost impossible.But Sessegnon has already achieved the impossible in that sense: he has been one of the Championship’s best players all season and is Fulham’s top‑scorer, his 15 league goals all the more remarkable when he played half the campaign at left-back. A defender‑turned‑winger with a goal poacher’s instinct, there’s little doubt that he will be a special player.Will he be special now, though, when Fulham need him to be? Slavisa Jokanovic, who deserves much praise for ignoring Sessegnon’s age and trusting his talent all season, did the sensible thing and deflected attention, but he could be forgiven for feeling worried.“It’s a big game for myself, for my assistants, for the whole team,” the Fulham manager said when asked if the second leg on Monday night will be a big game for the youngster. “He doesn’t need any more pressure on him.“The game doesn’t only depend on what Sessegnon will do. To put all this responsibility on the back of one kid – we don’t need that. He showed many times he’s a great lad, a great footballer, a great worker. We trust he’ll be at his best level. This man is 17 years old. This man is top-scorer for Fulham. This man has a very important future in front of him.”An important present, too: you would not back against Sessegnon pulling out something special, but the next question is whether he will be allowed to by Derby. Their defence was superb in the first leg, smothering Fulham’s passing game and limiting their best players’ chances to excel although the Derby manager, Gary Rowett, suggested his team would not simply sit on their advantage in the return.“We’ll try to be as brave as possible – what we can’t do is go down there and try to protect the lead,” said Rowett, who hinted he would make changes to his starting XI in order to maintain the same physically demanding performance.Will the way Derby neutralised Fulham alter the home side’s game plan? “We don’t need any revolution in my team,” Jokanovic said. “We followed the same style for the last few years, so it’s not necessary to change much. We will analyse today’s game, we’ll try to find a solution, to be more clinical. We must be ready for everything.”This is a beautifully balanced tie, likely to feature that sort of glorious chaos synonymous with the play‑offs. The winners will face either Middlesbrough or Aston Villa in the final, Villa taking a 1-0 advantage into their second leg, to be played on Tuesday.Before this season, Rowett’s last involvement in the second‑tier play-offs was as a player, scoring for Birmingham as they vainly tried to overturn a 4-0 semi-final deficit against Barnsley. That was on 18 May 2000, the day Sessegnon was born. What a remarkable story it would be if Sessegnon decided the game on Monday."
football,"• Celtic manager focusing on future after securing second treble• ‘I need to push them even harder next season‘
Ewan Murray at Hampden Park

Celtic’s players were entitled to enjoy their weekend party on the basis there seems no chance of extended celebrations. No sooner had Celtic made history by becoming the first team to claim back-to-back Scottish domestic trebles than their manager, Brendan Rodgers, was speaking of a need for improvement.Motherwell were seen off 2-0 in Saturday’s Scottish Cup final with Callum McGregor and Olivier Ntcham scoring the goals. Amid jubilant scenes, Rodgers looked to next season. “I need to push even harder now next year in relation to developing the players here first and foremost,” Celtic’s manager said. “And then bringing in players who can make a difference. It’s a constant need to improve.“We have a really young group that are improving and developing but to make a difference at that level needs greater quality. We have to invest and improve. But the reality is that we can’t spend fortunes because there’s not masses of money there to do that.”Rodgers added: “The trophies are always brilliant, they’re there in the cupboard but for me it’s always been about seeing players improve. That’s what my strength is, I think. So seeing individuals get better, which hopefully makes the team better and should accumulate most of the time in winning – that’s the biggest thing.“I think what we gained from this year is that when you’re not always at your best you can still win. That’s important. We had 61 games, that’s a lot of training and preparation and big-game mentality. The players will come out of this confident. They will get a bit of a longer rest this time as well. As a manager I have to push them harder.”As if to back up his words, Rodgers met with the representatives of Odsonne Édouard on Sunday as Celtic look to sign the striker from Paris Saint-Germain. Édouard has been on loan at Celtic this season but missed the cup final because of a hamstring injury.Slightly strangely, Rodgers refuses to cite European football as a priority, despite recurring domestic success. The former Liverpool manager continues to focus on why Celtic cannot make meaningful inroads in the Champions League or Europa League, as opposed to why they can. Under Neil Lennon, Celtic beat Barcelona and made the Champions League last 16. The club’s balance sheet is stronger than ever.“Without being defeatist it’s always going to be very, very difficult for us,” Rodgers said. “The first challenge is to qualify and we have extra games [to do that]. It depends what success is in Europe. What is success in Europe for a Scottish club?”Steven Gerrard’s arrival at Rangers has spiked interest but Rodgers was unwilling to talk up the scale of that rivalry at the end of such a successful domestic season. Gerrard fired a warning to Celtic last week by insisting Rodgers and his players have “had it their own way for far too long” but their was no public counter-blow.“It’s not a conversation,” Rodgers insisted. “Talk about Aberdeen. Aberdeen were second. Derek McInnes has done a brilliant job. Talk about them.”As a supporter of his own club, Rodgers continues to revel in the fulfilment of a dream. He admits he could not have contemplated such a stunning level of success over successive Scottish seasons. “You could never imagine it could go as well as it has,” said the 45-year-old. “From the first day I walked in to the club it’s been amazing.“It’s always complex, it’s never as easy as it seems when you win, a lot of stuff goes on behind the scenes, a lot of work, the brilliant staff and the club has really supported me in my time here, strategically. All the interests are aligned at the club and that allows me to work in confidence. But to think we’d be standing here two years later having created history. No, I’d be lying if I said I thought that.”"
football,"Kyle Walker believes his humble background has kept him grounded and England’s World Cup team have moved on from Euro 2016

Sat 26 May 2018 22.35 BST

It will soon be a year since Manchester City raised eyebrows by paying £50m for a full-back. Actually they paid £102m for two full-backs last summer, though Benjamin Mendy was to spend most of the season out injured. Kyle Walker, the original defensive investment, has enjoyed such a comfortable assimilation into City’s title-winning side and Pep Guardiola’s way of thinking that the fee is already starting to look a comparative bargain – to outsiders, at least. The traded commodity himself has never worried too much about valuation.“As a player you don’t put a price tag on your own head,” Walker explains, taking a break from England’s preparations for their pre-World Cup friendlies. “You can’t go around thinking: ‘I’m worth that much.’ It is just business that gets sorted out by the chairmen. For me there was a little bit of proving people wrong, because a fee like that does attract attention, but I think we could all see the transfer market went a little crazy in the end.”Together with John Stones and Fabian Delph, the 27-year-old is part of a Yorkshire core in the City defence that, it is hoped, will transfer to England. They look out for each other, look after each other and keep their feet firmly on the ground.Walker is likely to be asked to move into a back three at some point in the next couple of months but feels well-qualified to do so. “I used to play central defence for Sheffield United,” he says. “I had Chris Morgan at the side of me which helped me a lot because, if I did anything wrong, I’d be sure to find out about it.“I can still remember one of my first games. It was Hull away and they had Caleb Folan playing up front with Nick Barmby behind him. He was a classic target man and I had to mark him. ‘Morgs’ just told me: ‘Right, you deal with the headers and I’ll sweep up behind you.’ Right back is still my preferred position but as long as I’m on the field at the World Cup I’m completely happy to play anywhere.”Walker will find himself up against some City team-mates when England play Belgium in the group stage, in addition to familiar Premier League names such as Eden Hazard and Romelu Lukaku. He is relaxed about the situation. He is relaxed about everything. He frequently talks of his career as a journey, one that began on a Sheffield housing estate and is now unfolding on the world stage, and if he seems capable of taking it all in his stride, it is possibly because he remembers the early steps so well.“I got my first taste of real professional football on loan at Northampton,” he recalls, not something too many elite competitors in Russia will be able to boast. “I was 18 at the time and I played only nine games, but it was a massive opportunity for me. Sheffield were in the Championship and they were in League One when I went, so it meant I could get games.“Stuart Gray was the manager and he gave me the chance to show what I could do. I’ve never looked back from there, that was the point where my career took off. Some of those players depended on winning games for their mortgage. I had been with Sheffield from age seven, my career was being looked after, so it was something I hadn’t quite seen before. Training with those players was a real learning curve for me.”Walker’s career trajectory has indeed been ever upwards since. There were a few more loans in the first couple of seasons at Spurs but by 2012 he was recipient of the Professional Footballers’ Association’s young player of the year award, ahead of his team-mate Gareth Bale, and was named in the PFA team of the season.While two trophies in his first season at City confirmed his latest move as a shrewd one, the progression has not always been as smooth on the international front. Walker missed out on Roy Hodgson’s squads for the 2012 Euros and 2014 World Cup through picking up injuries at critical stages of the season, and though he made it to France two years ago the memories of Euro 2016 are far from happy ones. “It was difficult to take, I’m not going to lie and say there were loads of positives,” he says. “It was a negative. In the game against Iceland my feeling was that things were going to plan when we went 1-0 up. Instead scoring an early goal might have put us off our guard.“I don’t believe we thought we were already through but we were beginning to feel seeing out the game might be easy when a long throw came in and caught us by surprise.“The whole vibe around England now is completely different. It is a younger set of players and we are taking huge steps in the right direction but we still probably need to get more streetwise.“English footballers are honest, they will run for 90-odd minutes, but that is not always what you need. Sometimes you need to rein back a bit and try and control the game with your passing.“When we come up against Belgium, say, it could be a deciding game but we need to realise that we don’t have to score in the first 10 minutes. If you can control the game you can wait until the 80th minute or longer if necessary. I’m trying to bring that calmness from Manchester City, and so is John.“I’ve adapted my own game a bit since changing club. I stay back a bit more. When I was at Tottenham the fans wanted attack, attack, attack but, if you send too many bodies forward, you are liable for the counter. With England we are working in training on controlling situations a little better. If we can make it work on the pitch we will hopefully have a good tournament.”The idea seems to be gaining traction that England can play without fear or pressure at this World Cup, because after the last couple of disappointments so little is expected of them. Walker does not entirely agree. “You shouldn’t be looking for a free pass, if you want to win things you should play every game like it’s your last,” he says. “I don’t think we should be talking about pressure either, when we are playing the game we’ve been good at since we were kids at the very highest level. Anyone would want to play in a World Cup, why fear anything?“Everyone in the squad is there for a reason, the gaffer could have picked hundreds of others but this is the 23 he’s chosen to represent the country. That’s a privilege that should give you confidence. Just go out and enjoy it.”"
football,"The Liverpool manager still has raw memories of defeat in a Champions League final but he is undeterred as he prepares for another tilt at club football’s ultimate prize
Paul Wilson

Picture the scene. A sunbed by a hotel swimming pool in Las Vegas in May 2014. A German holidaymaker is trying to relax, to clear his mind of everything involving work, but his repose keeps being disturbed by noises off.“There was a football match on television and a lot of people were watching it,” Jürgen Klopp says, taking up the story. “It was Real Madrid v Atlético in the Champions League final and everyone was shouting in Spanish. I was kind of annoyed by hearing the noise, because I had been trying to ignore the game. I didn’t want to watch it, I had no clue who had scored or who had won, because it was still painful to think of what had happened the year before.“A year ago it had been different, we [Borussia Dortmund] had been in the final at Wembley. It’s not nice when you lose a final, and I have lost a few, but I will always try again. Being there is a big thing, it is unbelievable. Most people in the world try their whole life and don’t go to one final, but when you are there you need luck in specific moments.“What I learned from the game against Bayern Munich in 2013 is that when you are much better in the first part of the game you need to score. It helps a lot! I still haven’t watched the game back but the thing about finals is that someone has to suffer. All the people shouting in 2014 were Spanish, whereas the year before they had all been German, and that’s a good thing about football. That is absolutely OK but you must also learn that if something is really important to you, you have to be ready for suffering. That is how life is.”If it sounds as if the Liverpool manager would not have been much of a social butterfly on that holiday he would make considerably better company at the moment. Another final awaits, a chance at redemption against Real Madrid in Kiev, and despite finishing on the losing side in the two major European finals he has reached, the 50‑year-old is ready to go again.“Two weeks after a really nice season, we have a fantastic finish,” he says. “Coming in to work this morning I saw a car with two flags, Liverpool Champions League final Kiev, so it has started already. It’s really cool, we have the sort of smile on our face that you can pretty much only get from football, and one of the rules in sport is that the more you try the more likely you are to do it. But of course there are no guarantees. If guarantees are what you want then don’t qualify for a final. Stay at home or book a holiday.”Applying the same logic to Real Madrid – the more times you try the more likely you are to succeed – makes Liverpool clear underdogs. The Spanish side have featured in three of the last four finals, winning each time, and having already become the first club in the Champions League era to win back to back titles they are now going for three in a row.“Yes they are favourites, they know everything, they can write their own scripts because they have [now] experienced it four times in the last five years,” Klopp says, only a little wistfully. “There have been three dominant clubs in the last few years, and we are facing one of them. I have no problem with the situation and I don’t feel like an underdog. Liverpool were absolutely not favourites in 2005, and that was before they went 3-0 down.“To be honest, we like the role we are in. We like the situation and we are in a good moment. Real Madrid are a side of the highest quality going for three wins in three years, but we are Liverpool. That’s something not to forget.”With Mohamed Salah now touted as a potential Ballon d’Or winner after years of Cristiano Ronaldo‑Lionel Messi dominance, Saturday’s final is being trailed as the ultimate showdown between two of the leading individual performers, though Klopp, unsurprisingly, does not see it quite like that. “We are a team in a team game,” he explains. “It is not about having the better individual, usually it is about playing the better football, and for that to happen you need all the others as well.“Mo has played a fantastic season but even he would admit Cristiano has been performing at that level for years. His numbers are crazy, he has been 15 years at the top and scored about 47,000 goals, but I still don’t like making comparisons between players. At the time when Pelé was at his peak people didn’t go around comparing him to anyone else, they just thought he was the best and were glad to have him. Now we have Messi and Ronaldo. They have dominated football for such a long time even though there are so many other good players.“They are both similar in the way that in the final moment they are very often in the right position to score a goal, and that is the most difficult thing in the world to do. That’s why they are where they are. Their awards are well deserved, because when they stop playing we will miss them, 100%.”Klopp is perfectly entitled to hope that teamwork, with the emphasis on work, holds the key to success, though it would be a mistake to categorise the present Real Madrid side as a collection of expensive individuals without discipline.That idea belongs to the galáctico past, as does the suspicion that Ronaldo calls all the shots or that Real’s defending does not stand up to close scrutiny. Marcelo might be having sleepless nights over the difficulty of facing Salah but his side’s recent record in Europe speaks for itself. Time and again Real have gone up against the biggest names and come out on top, sometimes through individual brilliance but just as often through collective determination.At their best they can summon an intensity few can live with, though the same could be said of Klopp’s Liverpool in their run to this year’s final. History beckons for one side or the other, but which side will it be? The one with winning experience from the last two finals or the one with the growing conviction that this is their stage and their year?“In the end it will be a test of whose desire is bigger,” Klopp says. “Real have almost exactly the same lineup from winning it before, and that’s really rare. They will want to do it again but we will try to stop them. In a final, thank God, everything is possible.”"
football,"• Brackley Town 1-1 Bromley (aet, Brackley win 5-4 on penalties)• Brackley levelled in 94th minute to take final into extra time
Paul Doyle at Wembley Stadium

For 94 minutes it looked as if Brackley Town’s first appearance at Wembley in their 128-year history would wind up as an occasion that would haunt them for a very long time. It would have been impossible for them not to dwell on the improbable number of chances they missed while chasing an equaliser during the second half of a wild FA Trophy final. They hit the post, shanked wide from close range, had a shot cleared off the line and were thwarted on several occasions by Bromley’s indefatigable goalkeeper, David Gregory. But they refused to be denied.With seconds remaining in the fifth minute of stoppage time the club from a small market town in Northamptonshire, and a division below Bromley, drew level at last, as a long-range shot by Matt Lowe struck the post and rebounded into the net off the unfortunate defender Roger Johnson. A tense period of extra-time ensued, followed by an even tenser penalty shootout, which had a couple of twists and went to sudden death before Andy Brown, a deputy headmaster by day, struck the decisive blow for Brackley. That triggered scenes of joy at Wembley that will live long in Northamptonshire folklore. “The noise and sheer jubilation was just fantastic,” said their manager, Kevin Wilkin. “Hopefully days like this will happen again on a regular basis.” Hopefully, sure, but replicating drama like this would be a tall order for any club.Nearly 17,000 Bromley fans who turned up at Wembley – more than six times their average home attendance – will not remember this day quite as fondly. What will nag at them is the fact that they came agonisingly close to a precious honour on the club’s first appearance at Wembley since the 1949 FA Amateur Cup. Omar Bugiel fired them into the lead in the 19th minute with a sharp finish following a strong run by Adam Mekki. But Bugiel blazed over the bar in the shootout when victory was there for the taking. Between those two shots Bromley withstood ferocious pressure from Brackley, who last week lost to Harrogate in a promotion play-off in which victory would have enabled them to join Bromley in the National League next season.During one chaotic spell around the hour James Armson came close to scoring three times, hitting the post from six yards, slicing wide from nearly as close and seeing Gregory repel a third effort. Aaron Williams was also foiled, his low shot cleared off the line by Dan Johnson.Bromley twice threatened to wrap up victory on the counterattack but Brandon Hanlon was stopped first by a superb last-ditch tackle by Gareth Dean and then by a good save by Danny Lewis. Dean ventured up the other end in the dying seconds and it was he who applied the pressure that forced Johnson to stab the ball into his own goal. Johnson, a former Premier League defender who won the League Cup here with Birmingham City in 2011, was as distraught as Brackley were delighted.Bromley edged back in front when Gregory saved from Shane Byrne in the first shot of the shootout. But then Bugiel missed and Jack Holland hit the post, setting the scene for Brown to claim victory by slotting into the net, which he duly did before towards the outstretched arms of 5,500 Brackley fans.Brackley’s triumph completed a thrilling double-header of non-league showdowns at the national stadium. Earlier Stockton Town and Thatcham Town contested the FA Vase final, the showpiece competition for clubs from the eighth tier and lower. The teams, from different leagues in the ninth tier, were appearing on this stage for the first time, their runs to the final representing the latest high point in several seasons of remarkable progression by each club. Thatcham, champions of the Hellenic League, won 1-0 thanks to a penalty by their prolific striker, Shane Cooper-Clark.Thatcham had good reason to be confident of scoring as they went into the game, having won their league title this season on goal difference after netting 129 times in 38 matches. The west Berkshire side duly broke the deadlock in the 21st minute thanks to a penalty awarded after a foul by Jamie Ward on Jordan Brown. Cooper-Clark rammed the spotkick into the net, albeit via the left hand of Michael Arthur. That brought the striker’s tally for the season to a preposterous 63 goals.Stockton, a Teeside club who began playing senior football only in 2009 and won back-to-back promotions to reach their current perch in Northern League Division One, created chances throughout an absorbing game but could not force an equaliser, as centre-back Baboucarr Jarra twice made goal-saving interventions for Thatcham."

Graham Potter and Frank de Boer are the leading candidates to take over at Swansea as the Welsh club look to appoint their fifth permanent manager in two years following confirmation that Carlos Carvalhal has departed in the wake of relegation.De Boer has been under consideration in the past at the Liberty Stadium and the 48-year-old is back in the frame as Swansea finalise a list of contenders with a view to appointing a manager to rebuild the club in the Championship and implement a more attractive playing style. It is believed that De Boer, who has been out of work since being sacked as Crystal Palace manager at the start of last season, would be interested in the post.Potter, who has enjoyed incredible success with the Swedish club Östersund, is also highly regarded and could be viewed as exactly the sort of manager Swansea need to re-energise the club after three miserable seasons. The 42-year-old has worked in Sweden since 2011, winning three promotions with Östersund and, remarkably, taking the club to the last 32 of the Europa League in March, where they defeated Arsenal 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium but lost 4-2 on aggregate.Other names that have come under consideration include Brentford’s Dean Smith, who this week missed out on the West Bromwich Albion job, and Lee Johnson, the Bristol City manager. However, at this stage it appears as though Potter and De Boer are the frontrunners for a role that will require the manager to assemble a new team, with Swansea prepared for an exodus of players.Carvalhal was appointed in December on a short-term contract and with a view to potentially remaining in charge in the Championship, yet the way Swansea’s season imploded in the last two months convinced the club that the Portuguese, who had such a positive impact initially, was not the solution. Swansea failed to win any of their last nine league games, with Carvalhal’s increasingly cautious tactics doing nothing to help their cause during an awful run of results that culminated in relegation on the final day.Huw Jenkins, the Swansea chairman, said: “Naturally, we are all disappointed with the club’s relegation from the Premier League, and following discussions with Carlos, we felt it was in the best interests of both parties that we move in a new direction.”"

Toni Kroos says that Real Madrid will face “11 animals” in the Champions League final on Saturday and insists that Liverpool will be “tough,” “aggressive” opponents, prepared to press for 90 minutes but that Madrid will have “opportunities” to win a match he described as “50-50”.The Germany midfielder said it was a “great achievement” for Liverpool to have reached Kiev but denied that their motivation would be any greater than Madrid’s as he prepares to face a familiar opponent in the shape of the former Borussia Dortmund manager Jürgen Klopp.Kroos, who played Klopp’s sides often while at Bayern Munich, including in the 2013 Champions League final at Wembley, said: “Whenever we faced his teams it was difficult; at Bayern, we always had a lot of problems against Dortmund. Always. That is what I expect on Saturday. His teams are always aggressive, they press you a lot – for 90 minutes. They are highly motivated. I expect a very tough game for us but with opportunities to win.“My feeling is that [Klopp] is happy there,” Kroos added. “It is a great achievement for Liverpool to reach a final and to have a chance to win the Champions League. In my experience, it is always tough to play his teams, they always have more or less the same style.“So, I know for sure that it will be a very difficult game for us on Saturday. I know how he is able to motivate his teams, he gives them good tactics and I am sure it will be difficult, but I am also sure it is going to be difficult for Liverpool. They’ll be 11 animals, all really up for it, we’ll be better on the ball but they’re going to put us under pressure for 90 minutes and will be at 100% or even more. We’re expecting an aggressive Liverpool, who have a really quick forward line, but we can stop them,” he said.“They’re different to us and maybe don’t touch the ball as much, but they’re really rough, competitive, aggressive and really strong at the back. For them it’s an opportunity, they’ve not been in the final for more than 10 years and I don’t think they were expecting to get here so for that I think they’re going to give their all.“Both teams are hungry; I don’t see a favourite [and] I don’t see Liverpool having more hunger or anything,” Kroos added.“To reach a Champions League final you can’t be a bad team. I don’t see a favourite, Liverpool beat Manchester City, one of the big favourites. We can be a favourite as well. If you reach three Champions League finals in a row it shows you must be top in terms of motivation. If not, you don’t beat Paris, Juventus and Bayern in a row. Reaching three consecutive finals gives confidence but it does no mean we are any less motivated.”"

Lyon’s right-back Lucy Bronze described becoming the first England player to win the Champions League in its current format as “the best thing I’ve done to date.”Goals from Amandine Henry, Eugénie Le Sommer, Ada Hegerberg and Camille Abily handed Lyon their third consecutive Champions League title after they had fallen behind in an action-packed extra time.After a dull 90 minutes with the score at 0-0, the game sprung to life in style when a deflected strike from the Wolfsburg forward Pernille Harder, massively against the run of play, was followed by Henry’s top corner strike from a wonderful Hegerberg chip. In between Harder’s goal and the leveller, Wolfsburg had gone down to 10 as Alexandra Popp picked up a second yellow for a rash challenge on Delphine Cascarino. The fresh legs of Shanice van de Sanden then sealed the tie for the French side as she three times raced clear on the right, first providing the assist for Le Sommer, then for an unmarked Hegerberg – her record-breaking 15th Champions League goal in a single campaign – and finally for Abily, on her final appearance for Lyon at 33.Lyon had dominated in normal time and had felt aggrieved when a Le Sommer header seemed to cross the line, only to be waved away. “Watching their goal go in was heartbreaking, and having just had a goal disallowed that definitely crossed the line was a very up and down situation,” said Bronze.“We push for more and more in these big games. Lyon and Wolfsburg are trendsetting and pushing women’s football. We do as much as we can as players on the pitch, but we need the referee and goalline technology to be up to standard as well,” she added.Bronze was full of praise for the Lyon substitutes, particularly the former Liverpool player Van de Sanden. “Shanice was a game changer in the end, she got three out of four assists, came on and made the difference with the pace she’s got getting in behind. Both teams were tiring and she’s so energetic, works so hard and won us the game”This was the third meeting of the two sides in a Champions League final. Both previous encounters were tight affairs; in 2013 only Martina Müller’s penalty for Wolfsburg at Stamford Bridge could separate the European giants, and in 2016 Lyon won on penalties.The first chance of this match fell to Lyon after five minutes, after Griedge M’Bock Bathy was brought down in the middle of the park. A swung-in free-kick fell to Henry but her shot bounced clear off a Wolfsburg body. Minutes later, up the other end, Popp’s ball across the front of Sarah Bouhaddi’s goal was teasingly out of reach of the incoming Ewa Pajor.The tree-lined Valeriy Lobanovskyi Stadium was close to empty shortly before the whistle, perhaps thanks to heavy security. However, 35 minutes into the match the little 17,000-seater was heaving, mainly with locals.Lyon edged the first 45 with the tricky winger Amel Majri and the left-back Selma Bacha causing plenty of trouble for Anna Blässe on the left.However, the half had failed to light up, half chances and misplaced passes the order of the day. After 15 minutes Lyon began to up the pressure a little, and a Dzsenifer Marozsán corner was cleared as far as Bronze, whose volley went wide.With the Wolfsburg defence resolute and well organised, Lyon were forced to try their luck from distance, a swerving shot from the left-hand corner of the box by a frustrated Marozsán comfortably collected by Almuth Schult. As the half drew to a close, Harder, the heartbeat of the Wolfsburg attack, was increasingly forced to go deeper to get the ball.With Wolfsburg struggling to make anything happen, their manager, Stephan Lerch, swapped the winger Caroline Graham Hansen for Tessa Wullaert at the break to try to shake things up. An uneventful opening to the second half was brought to an abrupt halt when Sara Bjork Gunnarsdóttir crumpled to the ground, on her own, clearly in pain – the exertions of the German cup final win after extra time and penalties at the weekend starting to show in the legs of the players.Lyon spent much of the second period camped in the opposition half and they were denied a breakthrough in the 69th minute when a corner from the left found Henry, who flicked the ball goalwards. Replays seemed to show the ball crossed the line, but Noelle Maritz cleared and the referee waved away appeals. Lyon kept pushing for what would surely be a winner. Cascarino, on for the bright Bacha, sent in a low cross but Le Sommer’s shot was nicely saved by Schult.Wolfsburg came out fighting in extra time, as Harder raced forward and her deflected strike from outside the box gave the German side a surprising lead. It was then that the game exploded. Popp received her second yellow before Hegerberg’s lovely chip found the onrushing Henry, who put the ball into the top of the net. Moments later the holders took the lead as Van de Sanden raced down the right and her cross was met by Le Sommer to poke past the keeper.With Wolfsburg forced to push forward they were left even more exposed, and again, Van de Sanden found an unmarked Hegerberg to put the game out of an exhausted Wolfsburg’s reach in the first half of added time. Then Abily put a lovely curling strike beyond Schult with two minutes to play, giving her an emotional send-off as she rounded off Lyon’s record fifth European title, one she said was “amazing, I couldn’t hope for a better end. I came in and scored and we won, it was a perfect night for me.”"

As Riteesh Mishra emerges from his dugout at Bramall Lane on Sunday afternoon, the crowd will be treated to the extremely rare sight of a British Asian manager on the touchline.During his time as head coach of Charlton Women, Mishra has commanded a few headlines but on Sunday he knows his team’s third-tier promotion play-off final with Blackburn will merely serve as a footnote to a ground-breaking announcement from the Football Association.Once the final whistle blows in this clash between the winners of the Women’s Premier League northern and southern divisions, the FA will begin revealing the final composition of its radically rebranded top two tiers.Officials are scheduled to spend the evening telephoning those 15 clubs who applied for the maximum of nine places still available in next season’s Women’s Super League first and second divisions, informing them if their bids have failed or succeeded. Then, on Monday morning, they are scheduled to make those decisions public and an overhaul destined to change the entire topography of the female game in England will be complete.While WSL 1’s dramatic makeover entails the top flight not only becoming fully professional but expanding from 10 to either 12 or 14 teams, the still predominantly part-time second tier stretches to 12 sides, has been renamed the Championship and is expected to welcome the newly formed Manchester United as well as either Blackburn or Charlton.Since March, when 10 clubs were awarded WSL1 licences for 2018-19, the FA has been considering the financial viability of further bids from, among others, Sunderland and West Ham.The imperative to turn fully professional creates both exciting opportunity and apparent unfairness, with Sunderland appearing emblematic of the latter. Despite finishing seventh in WSL 1 this season, Melanie Copeland’s side are struggling financially after being cut adrift by their parent men’s club.Although seven of Phil Neville’s current England team – including Lucy Bronze, Steph Houghton, Jill Scott and Jordan Nobbs – began their careers at a team integral to the wider development of the women’s game, Sunderland were duly left to make a joint, late bid for WSL 1 status with Northumbria University. Should it fail, they will be demoted, possibly to the third tier northern section.It seems particularly harsh on Copeland, who assisted Neville during England’s recent World Cup qualifiers. Highly regarded in FA circles, she hopes to become one of only a handful of English women to gain the Pro-Licence coaching qualification yet is struggling to fund the £9,000 course.Similar anomalies abound. Yeovil scored two goals and collected two points in 18 WSL 1 games this season, yet, after raising the £350,000 needed to turn professional, secured a licence to remain in the top division.A rung lower, Manchester United are investing around £5m into building a fully professional squad from scratch under the novice coach Casey Stoney. The high-profile former England defender faces the daunting task of assembling and moulding a winning team while cutting her managerial teeth.United must eclipse the WSL 2 champions, Doncaster Belles, whose “promotion” has been blocked by inadequate finances. “It’s really unfair,” says Faye Lygo, the club’s outgoing chair. “Sadly, it’s money, not football ability, that counts.”Tellingly, many talented players are departing WSL 1 clubs. They simply dare not risk abandoning longer-term, often significantly better-paid and infinitely more secure, careers such as teaching, by turning professional.Hope Powell, despite her newly promoted Brighton side having been granted a top tier licence, is slightly concerned. “If you stretch WSL 1 any further than 12 teams you’ll dilute the talent,” says the former England manager. “The quality will suffer.”"

Leicester’s 3-1 win over Arsenal on Wednesday was welcome, not least for Claude Puel but the mutterings continue that the manager is set to be replaced. Before midweek, his team had taken one point from an available 15 but three against Tottenham could drive them to an eighth-placed finish – surely a decent effort? Mauricio Pochettino worries that nothing is ever good enough for some Spurs fans. He wants to make sure of third.

Roma plan on resisting Liverpool’s advances for Alisson until at least after the World Cup and would expect to get around €90m (£79m) for the Brazil goalkeeper should they ultimately agree to sell him.Liverpool have yet to make an official approach for Alisson but have contacted Roma in regards to his availability as Jürgen Klopp targets a new principal goalkeeper in the wake of Loris Karius’s horror show in the Champions League final defeat against Real Madrid last Saturday.Roma are desperate to keep hold of Alisson, who has established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in world football since joining the Italian club from Internacional in 2016, as well as Brazil’s No 1 in the lead-up to the finals in Russia this summer.The 25-year-old’s contract runs until June 2021 so Roma are not under great pressure to sell him and ideally would like to keep hold of the player for at least one more season. They also plan to offer Alisson a new deal which would secure for him an increase on his wages of €1.5m (£1.3m) a year before tax.Liverpool will make further contact with Roma as they look to secure a deal for Alisson but ultimately may be put off by what would be a record fee for a goalkeeper.Their advances may also be cut short by interest from the team who defeated them in Kiev at the weekend. Real are known to be monitoring Alisson’s future and could well make a bid for him either side of the World Cup finals."

Joachim Löw has agreed to extend his contract as Germany’s manager until 2022.Löw, whose deal runs out in 2020, has been in charge for 12 years and in 2014 led Germany to their fourth World Cup victory. He has also been linked with the manager’s position at Arsenal following Arsène Wenger’s departure after 22 years at the club.“This is a big responsibility to continue developing players,” said the 58-year-old. “To work with the best players in Germany, then develop them and to make them better, to form a team that sets the highest goals, this is what drives and still gives me joy.”Löw has been in charge for 160 matches, winning 106, more than any other Germany manager. He started out as the assistant to Jürgen Klinsmann after only limited coaching experience in club football.Löw has named his preliminary World Cup squad and has found a place for Manuel Neuer, despite the Bayern Munich goalkeeper having not played since suffering a hairline fracture in his left foot in September.Marco Reus was also selected but his Borussia Dortmund team-mate Mario Götze, who scored Germany’s winner in the 2014 World Cup final, has been left out.“It wasn’t his best season,” said Löw of the 25-year-old. “He wasn’t able to show his incredible quality. Personally, I’m very sorry for him.”Goalkeepers: Bernd Leno (Bayer Leverkusen), Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich), Marc-André ter Stegen (Barcelona), Kevin Trapp (Paris Saint-Germain)Defenders: Jérôme Boateng (Bayern Munich), Matthias Ginter (Borussia Monchengladbach), Jonas Hector (FC Cologne), Mats Hummels (Bayern Munich), Joshua Kimmich (Bayern Munich), Marvin Plattenhardt (Hertha Berlin), Antonio Rüdiger (Chelsea), Niklas Süle (Bayern Munich), Jonathan Tah (Bayer Leverkusen)Midfielders: Julian Brandt (Bayer Leverkusen), Julian Draxler (Paris Saint-Germain), Leon Goretzka (Schalke 04), Ilkay Gündogan (Manchester City), Sami Khedira (Juventus), Toni Kroos (Real Madrid), Mesut Özil (Arsenal), Marco Reus (Borussia Dortmund), Sebastian Rudy (Bayern Munich), Leroy Sané (Manchester City)Forwards: Mario Gómez (VfB Stuttgart), Thomas Müller (Bayern Munich), Nils Petersen (SC Freiburg), Timo Werner (RB Leipzig)"

Tactics are always contingent, never discreet. No manager can ever casually decide how he will play and only then turn to his squad and decide how best to array his resources within the system he has selected, before finally paying attention to the situation and the opposition. Everything is inter‑related. As Barney Ronay observed last week, the Premier League has never seemed so stratified and that, inevitably, has had an impact on how teams play.As with so much in football, the issue is one of degree. Since Herbert Chapman first recognised the value of counterattacking with Northampton Town in the first decade of the 20th century, there have been sides who sought to make their opposition do the bulk of the attacking.This is one of the great virtues of football as a sport: the better side usually win but a weaker team can overcome a stronger one by sitting back, defending, allowing them possession and striking on the break. For one team to have almost complete domination of the ball used to be the preserve of mismatched cup ties, when a lower-league side would go into the bunker, look to survive and hope that if they were exceptionally lucky they might launch a guerrilla sortie that could bring an implausible victory.But as the gulf grows between rich and poor (or, more accurately, relatively poor, given that the vast majority of Premier League sides will be in the top 30 of Deloitte’s list of the world’s richest clubs by revenue), so the dynamic that was once characteristic of the FA Cup’s early rounds has become common in the Premier League.In the first three seasons that Opta collected data, between 2003-04 and 2005-06, there were only three games in which one side had 70% or more of the ball. That figure rose gradually to reach 36 in 2016-17. This past season, there were 63 instances.To an extent, that is a matter of choice. Under Pep Guardiola Manchester City play a style of football that, through its focus on positioning and generating passing options, ensures a high level of possession. City won the league having had far more possession and completed far more passes than any team before.How possible that would have been without the extraordinary wealth available to Guardiola is open to question, although there have been plenty of astonishingly rich sides before who have not played football like that. City’s football was the result of philosophy facilitated by wealth.Not surprisingly, City were the biggest contributors to that list of 63 games. They had more than 70% possession on 26 occasions, including at home against Swansea when they set a Premier League record by registering 82.95%. They also had the second-most possession in an individual game, against Everton. But what is perhaps most striking is the game that is third on the list. On 10 March Huddersfield registered 81.2% possession against Swansea. Admittedly, Carlos Carvalhal’s side had Jordan Ayew sent off after 11 minutes, but still, the figures are extreme.Swansea, in fact, were involved in seven of the 63 games (four of them under Carvalhal), winning twice and drawing twice, always on the low possession side, the legacy of their Brendan Rodgers years thoroughly shredded.Jürgen Klopp describes that hedgehog tactic as being like hoping to win the lottery, limiting the number of chances in the game and hoping that the opportunities to which you restrict your opponent are few enough and hard enough that they don’t take any of them, but for a certain level of club perhaps that is the most effective way if playing. After all, if Swansea had replicated the points return they achieved in those seven games in which they had less than 30% possession across the season, they would have accumulated 43 points and stayed up comfortably.The implication is that the explosion of games of unbalanced possession is driven not merely by the bigger team wanting the ball, but by the smaller team rejecting it. It is as though the example of Guardiola’s Barcelona a decade ago not merely encouraged elite sides to try to dominate possession, but the measures taken to combat that team, most notably by José Mourinho’s Internazionale in that 2010 Champions League semi-final, legitimised the notion of playing without the ball.The result was that Chelsea’s bizarre performance at the Etihad Stadium, when they essentially sat back and watched City knock the ball around. Chelsea in that game clearly embraced their role; it was not just City being good. There has been a shift in mentality that has gone hand-in-hand with the increasing financial inequality.That has long-term implications: what has an appeal in a one-off cup tie may not be so intriguing if a sixth of all Premier League games now have the shape of the sport of handball, midfields vanishing as one team camps around their own box and the other tries to break it down.When a league prides itself on – and has been marketed as – being an environment in which everybody can beat everybody, full of midfield to-and-fro, a culture in which a number of clubs go into games accepting that the only way they can compete is by not competing – must be a major concern. The march of the elite away from the rest is creating tensions the game in its present form may not be able to sustain."

Racist and homophobic chants are on the rise in Russia before the World Cup finals, with LGBT and ethnic minority supporters travelling to the country being issued with details of an emergency WhatsApp helpline to report any issues or request urgent help.Although overall incidents of discrimination have declined, a report found there has been a spike in the number of discriminatory chants heard inside stadiums in Russia, many of which are being used for games during the World Cup, beginning on 14 June.The research into discrimination in Russian football was undertaken by the Fare Network and the Moscow‑based Sova Center and was the sixth such report published since 2012. It noted more monkey chants, neo-Nazi songs and anti‑Caucasian chants, with 19 cases in the 2017‑18 season compared to two last season and 10 the season before.Victims included players from the French national team, who were targeted with monkey chants during a game against Russia in March, and the Liverpool youth player Bobby Adekanye, who was racially abused by Spartak Moscow supporters. The Russia national team goalkeeper Guilherme Marinato, a naturalised citizen born in Brazil, was twice targeted by Spartak fans calling him a monkey.The report also notes a worrying prevalence of homophobia, which it claims is a relatively new form of discrimination inside Russian stadiums, where fans are now labelling opponents “gay” as a means of abuse more often than ever before.“This is a practice that takes sustenance from state-led homophobia, but has been copied from leagues in western Europe,” the report stated. “These levels of discriminatory chanting indicate that xenophobic views remain deeply rooted among many Russian football fans.”Piara Powar, the Fare network’s executive director, said: “There are reasons to hope that the World Cup authorities will not allow serious violent incidents to take place by using all the resources of law enforcement agencies and special services.“However, the football authorities in Russia and Fifa have missed valuable opportunities and time to deliver lasting change in Russia. We hope the spirit that brings people together will keep fans with provocative intentions out of the World Cup, and equality and understanding will be the prevalent story of Russia 2018.”"

Michael Carrick’s 464th and final Manchester United game – barring an unlikely appearance in the FA Cup final against Chelsea on Saturday – featured a vintage moment via a superb pass that created Marcus Rashford’s first-half winner.The midfielder had walked out to a guard of honour and on 80 minutes strode off the turf for the last time to a standing ovation. Carrick will join José Mourinho’s coaching staff, the Portuguese indicating he will one day be his new No 2, following Rui Faria’s departure in the summer.Carrick said: “I have to thank the manager an awful lot. It is an unbelievable opportunity for me. I look forward to learning off him, he is one of the very best. I am sure he will teach me a few things and we will have some success in the near future, I am certain of that. We will give everything we can to bring the FA Cup back here next week.”pic.twitter.com/k6xAxtOw68Mourinho said: “I will organise my coaching staff in a way where the assistant manager figure doesn’t exist. I am going to have assistant coaches, I am going to have fitness coaches and a structure where they are specialists in different areas connected to the performance, and I’m not going to have an assistant managing in the sense of the word.“The particular reason is I think it will be Michael Carrick in the future when he has his badges, pro licence, when he makes the bridge between being a player to [an] assistant. Because people think it is just like one day I’m a player and the next I’m a coach. It is not like that.“I have nobody in the world of football ready to be my assistant manager, so I prefer to educate people to structure my staff in a way where there is education and improvement. I am going to improve my staff in the performance level and in relation to the tactical work, I am going to bring some people that until this moment have not come with me yet.”This first home game since Sir Alex Ferguson’s brain haemorrhage featured a note of best wishes in the programme, and the home crowd rising midway through the second half while chanting: “Stand up for Alex Ferguson”.Victory for United was their 25th in the league and took them to 81 points and with second place already secured thoughts turn to the Cup final, for which Anthony Martial is a doubt, though Romelu Lukaku will return to training this week following an ankle problem.Mourinho made nine changes from Thursday’s goalless draw at West Ham, Scott McTominay and Alexis Sánchez surviving.The headline news here was Martial’s unavailability because of a knee problem, with some confusion regarding whether he was seen driving from the ground just before kick-off.Mourinho said: “He was injured, he was injured Friday training session, yesterday [Saturday] couldn’t train. He had treatment in the morning at the training ground and he stayed away [today]. I don’t know [about the final]. I know Romelu will be back for Tuesday and we have to see.”Javi Gracia’s selection showed three changes to their previous game, as Heurelho Gomes, Gerard Deulofeu and Richarlison came in for Orestis Karnezis, Étienne Capoue and Troy Deeney. Despite the defeat his side finished 14th and the Spaniard indicated he will remain in place next season. “I think so,” Gracia said.Carrick’s first intervention was to slide in on Roberto Pereyra but he was left flailing as the visiting midfielder evaded the challenge and Watford turned defence into attack.United needed 11 minutes to claim a first corner. Daley Blind, making a first league start since August, swung in the kick, the ball reached Juan Mata who found Rashford, and the striker blazed high from 25 yards.When Mata next popped up this was on the left, the Spaniard finding Sánchez as he pulled away at the far post. Yet though the ball fell sweetly on his right boot, the Chilean’s volley was wide.Next came a moment that summed up United’s season. Mata hit Rashford first time along the right and he did the same, firing the ball into the area. It had Watford scrambling and stood out as a rare move of slickness and pace: a scarcity of this has proved the unwanted trademark of Mourinho’s side this year.Now, though, came Carrick’s rewinding of the clock, as he slid a 40-yard ball on to Mata’s left boot. He passed right to Rashford and the 20-year-old collected a 13th goal of the campaign.Carrick featured in United’s opening foray in the second half though his shot was blocked. A Watford move came via Andre Gray when the centre-forward took possession outside the area, though he was soon stymied.Later, a Rashford pot-shot sailed over the bar and Watford had a mini-flurry in and around United’s area, before Carrick’s farewell.Always a classy operator, he ended with a classy sign-off, patting the badge and offering a goodbye clap as a thank you to the crowd, closing a gilded 12 years at Old Trafford. Carrick said: “It’s the greatest club in the world and I thank you for your support.”"

This feature, you will note, is called ‘10 Things to Look Out For’ rather than ‘10 Things to Look Forward To’. Thank goodness for that, because there might not be much to look forward to at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday. The match between Swansea and Stoke is likely to be a wake, with both clubs wondering how the hell they got into this mess. A number of players will be making their last appearance for both sides, seeing no contradiction in the belief that they are far too good to play in the Championship. Swansea could still stay up, but they need snookers, a miracle and, most unlikely of all, at least one goal. RSSuddenly Southampton seem an attractive proposition again. Having all but avoided relegation, the club can begin looking up rather than down. There would have been an exodus of players had they dropped a division but Saints, with Mark Hughes likely to remain, will be in a strong position again this summer. Some of the younger players, especially those such as Jack Stephens and Jan Bednarek, ought to come back hardened by the experience. There is no obvious candidate ready to jump ship, as in years gone by, with Ryan Bertrand the biggest-name exit imaginable, while it is difficult to see Sofiane Boufal or Guido Carrillo staying put in Hampshire much longer. It was always going to be a big summer either way, but with survival set to be confirmed at home against Manchester City on Sunday, the club must take stock and learn from their mistakes. BFAt 2pm on Sunday, somebody – maybe, just maybe, on Twitter – is going to be very angry at Jürgen Klopp. He can’t win with his selection for Liverpool’s last league match against Brighton. If he picks his best XI he will be jeopardising their fitness before the Champions League final against Real Madrid; if he picks a weakened team he will be jeopardising Liverpool’s place in next season’s Champions League. There are so many things for Klopp to juggle: momentum, mood, match sharpness, avoiding injury to key players. Liverpool only need a point, and Klopp’s history suggests he will start a very strong side with a view to taking players off after an hour. But if one of the Fab Three twangs a hamstring, he may never hear the end of it. RSWith Champions League qualification out of Chelsea’s hands, Sunday’s trip to St James’ Park is ever likelier to be Antonio Conte’s last league game in charge. Of greater impact might be the question of whether it is also a swansong for his counterpart in the home dug-out. Although results have fallen away in recent weeks, Rafa Benítez has much to feel satisfied with a year after guiding Newcastle back up from the Championship: his side have survived comfortably after a rocky start, he has coaxed decisive performances from a number of players such as Jonjo Shelvey, Jamaal Lascelles and Mo Diamé; and he remains an enormously popular figure on Tyneside. Yet as ever with Newcastle, off-field uncertainty around budgets and ownership threaten to hobble their progress, and are likely to determine whether Benítez remains at a club for whom a place in at least the top eight should be a realistic goal next season. The chance to sign off 2017-18 with a victory over historic adversaries Chelsea should be one Benítez will jump at. TDOn the face of it, the scene is set for one big royal knees-up in West Yorkshire, with Huddersfield set to toast safety and Arsène Wenger, after 22 years, bowing out of Arsenal. Wenger will be desperate to go out with a bang, particularly after a couple of raw reminders of their shortcomings under him recently, namely their Europa League exit to Atlético Madrid and defeat at Leicester on Wednesday evening. The biggest worry is that Huddersfield might wake up from their survival hangover with a bounce – after celebrating safety into the early hours of Thursday morning at a Fitzrovia nightclub. The best bit about their Premier League party was that, after opting to ditch the plane home – instead favouring the team coach so they could presumably continue festivities more easily – they were told that their coach driver was not permitted to clock up the mileage back from Stamford Bridge. David Wagner subsequently gave his players – who travelled back north on the train – two days off, but can they manage one final lasting surprise before the season’s out? BFThe biggest risk West Bromwich Albion could take this summer is to wriggle out of giving Darren Moore the full-time job. It was cruel, to say the least, that the 44-year-old picked up the manager of the month award on the same day his team were relegated from the Premier League, given he dragged the club up off the floor to the verge of whatwould have ranked one of the most extraordinary miracles of all time. He has galvanised a troubled group that had gone awry under Alan Pardew’s leadership and, if he was installed as caretaker manager sooner, it is not unfathomable to imagine a different outcome this season. The other names linked with the job – Dean Smith, Chris Wilder and even Lee Johnson – have all impressed in the Championship and, surely, Moore should at least be given a chance to do the same after bidding farewell to the Premier League at Crystal Palace. BFFor 12 years, Michael Carrick has been the best supporting actor of Old Trafford. He is the only survivor of the last great United team, which won three consecutive titles and a Champions League between 2006 and 2009. Carrick, who replaced Roy Keane by not replacing him at all, had a major impact with his defensive awareness, calmness and particularly the range and positivity of his passing. He had some lows after that - he was twice left to deal with Xavi and Andres Iniesta on his own in a Champions League final, and his mistakes against Bayern Munich in 2010 and Manchester City in 2011 were savagely punished – but recovered to become a senior player either side of Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement. The coaches who appreciated Carrick, like Ferguson and Martin Jol, really appreciated him. On Sunday, United fans will get to pay tribute before he disappears modestly onto the coaching staff. RSAll right-thinking neutrals should hope this Spurs team have another crack at winning something next season, but there is a nagging sense that Sunday’s game against Leicester might be the end of an era. In a sense, that’s obvious: Spurs will play at the new White Hart Lane next season, and the whiff of a new era will extend way beyond the Michelin-starred cooking that will be a feature of Spurs’ new gastrofooty experience. But the Coquilles St. Jacques Grillées et Minestrone de Palourdes won’t taste half as good if Spurs fans are watching a different team to the one that has charmed everyone in the past three seasons. Toby Alderweireld and Danny Rose look certain to leave for, erm, starters. Though they would be missed, their departure would not be heavy on symbolism. But if any of Mauricio Pochettino, Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli go, the team could break up at speed. RSA pre-match grumble-off between the respective fans here would be quite the spectacle, with Hammers bemoaning their loss of identity on and off the pitch since the London Stadium move and Everton fans simmering with discontent over their unappealing displays under Sam Allardyce. A common thread between them though might be a measure of respect for David Moyes. For all that the Scot’s reputation has tumbled in the past five years, Everton have struggled to regain the consistency and status they had under Moyes while he has at least provided West Ham with sufficient steel and organisation to survive, though fans remain ambivalent about his style and whether he’s the man for the job long-term. With Moyes confident enough to be challenging West Ham’s owners with statements about his future ambitions for the club, he can strengthen his hand with a convincing win over his former club, who also have some managerial issues to resolve, as Wayne Rooney’s wavering over his commitment to the club demonstrates. TDBurnley’s home games have been a struggle. We mean that, for the most part, in a positive sense, because they are arguably the best pound-for-pound team in the division. Their matches have been tough and uncompromising. In 18 league games at Turf Moor, Burnley have scored 15 and conceded 15. The end-of-season atmosphere may be conducive to the players of both sides having fun of the less masochistic kind. Burnley will stay seventh whatever happens, though Bournemouth could ensure back-to-back top-ten finishes if results go their way. With both sides overachieving spectacularly, this match should also be a celebration of that pariah species: the English manager. RS"

That’s all from me. It was extremely ordinary for a long time, and then, suddenly, it was completely extraordinary. Bye!

7.43pm BST
19:43

Wolfsburg go up to collect their runners-up medals, through a guard of honour formed by their victorious opponents. The defeat must be all the more painful for the 100 or so seconds of joy that came between their taking the lead and Popp getting sent off.

7.37pm BST

“My player of the match is Cascarino,” writes Hubert O’Hearn. She was indeed excellent. The quality of Lyon’s bench decided the game, really. “What a dynamo. Keep hoping she can claim Irish heritage the same as Tony did.”

Van de Sanden is getting particular attention from her team-mates, as Lyon’s players celebrate their victory. And well she might, she was absolutely unplayable.

What a phenomenal, game-changing introduction it’s been.

7.13pm BST
19:13

19:01

91 mins | Wolfsburg 0-0 Lyon They’re off! Yet again!

7.00pm BST
19:00

Wolfsburg have had two shots in total, and none on target. This really is quite damning, given that they have had some decent attacking positions. Lyon have had 15 shots, of which six have been on target. As they prepare for extra time, Bouhaddi is having her left wrist strapped up quite heavily. On the downside, this will hinder her shot-stopping. On the plus side, she hasn’t needed to do any shot-stopping. Still, there may be penalties.

6.55pm BST

football,"• Manager will need to balance new signings with outgoings• Mousa Dembélé, Danny Rose and Toby Alderweireld could leave
David Hytner

Mon 14 May 2018 21.25 BST


First published on Mon 14 May 2018 12.00 BST

Mauricio Pochettino wants his demand for bravery and risk-taking in the summer transfer market to extend to swift decisions over the players he is willing to sell – namely Mousa Dembélé, Danny Rose and Toby Alderweireld.The Tottenham manager is determined to improve his squad after a third-place Premier League finish in order to take the final step to trophies next season and he would love Daniel Levy, the chairman, to sanction a massive investment drive.In his heart Pochettino knows that is unrealistic; he will continue to have to balance signings with outgoings because of the repayment costs associated with the club’s £850m new stadium.Yet he is keen for there to be clarity over the assets in the squad on which he could cash in – and it means doing early business with them to give him greater flexibility on his signings. The transfer window in England closes on 8 August.It will doubtless disappoint some fans and players that Pochettino is prepared to consider offers for Dembélé – most of the playing staff rate the midfielder as their No 1 team‑mate. But there are concerns over his fitness – whether he can stay the course, in physical terms, for another season in England.Dembélé had ankle surgery last summer, started this season slowly and finished it back in the treatment room with an ankle injury. The 30-year-old could be tempted by a final major pay day in China, where Beijing Guoan are interested in him. He has one year to run on his contract.Rose blotted his copybook last August when he gave an interview in which he urged the club to sign more world-class players and made plain his frustrations at the wage structure. Everton want the left-back this summer.Alderweireld’s situation has been well documented. Tottenham stand to lose him for £25m next summer because of a release clause in his contract and consequently they are keen to get more for him now. The centre-half has played six times for the club since 1 November, when he injured a hamstring, and the problem could be that his suitors would want him to prove his form and fitness at the World Cup for Belgium before they move for him.Pochettino was outspoken after his team’s final game of the season on Sunday – the 5-4 Wembley win against Leicester – when he prodded Levy over squad strengthening. It felt as though he was flexing his muscles from a position of power, the club having once again qualified for the Champions League, and it might not be coincidence that Pochettino is in talks over a new contract.Pochettino was also seeking to mark his turf over the type of player he wants to sign. Typically Levy has preferred younger ones with resale value but Pochettino would like him to consider more seasoned professionals.Harry Kane has said the emergence of Mohamed Salah at Liverpool has driven him to new heights. The Tottenham striker finished the season with a career-best 30 Premier League goals, though it was not enough for him to win the Golden Boot for a third year in succession.Salah took the award with 32 goals, a record for a 38-game season. Kane scored 25 in 2015-16 and 29 in 2016-17 and he got 21 in 2014-15 when he finished as runner-up to Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero in the Golden Boot. The 24-year-old is determined to maintain his upward path and has set himself the target of bettering Salah’s total.“I am looking forward to the competition again next season,” Kane said. “I haven’t seen Mo to talk with him. But this is what you want at the highest level – you want to be fighting for things and I think we pushed each other. He broke the record for a 38-game season and that is what I will try to do next season.”"
football,"Ian Wright may be perplexed by Unai Emery but history shows that shock choices are not that unusual for Arsenal
Amy Lawrence

Well, that took a very sudden left turn. In keeping with the Arsenal tradition of appointing unexpected managers, it seems the board have lurched from favouring a 36-year-old former player who had never managed a game to a totally new face in the frame which provoked a stunned Ian Wright to query: “Where’s Unai Emery come from?” As a reaction it is not quite in the realms of Arsène Who? but it captures the mood of curious bewilderment.A quick flick through the club’s history books demonstrates that unexpected does not always mean bad. In the 1930s George Allison moved from the boardroom to the dugout and won the league. Bertie Mee had been the club’s physiotherapist and engineered the double win in 1971. George Graham came from Millwall in English football’s second tier and collected a cluster of trophies between 1987 and 1994. Arsène Wenger famously arrived from Nagoya Grampus 8 in Japan and, according to the sceptical players, looked more like a geography teacher than a football manager.The surprise here is that all the signs were that Arsenal were looking elsewhere. Emery’s background is hardly so arcane to make this truly shocking. He brings his own brand of clout and experience. Repeated third placed finishes at Valencia, making his teams the best of the rest behind Barcelona and Real Madrid, were eye-catching.A hat-trick of Europa League victories with Sevilla enhanced his status enough for Paris Saint-Germain to give him that chance to try to take the team towards their holy Champions League grail. It didn’t quite work out on that front but the current scene at Arsenal, and what is needed, has more of a nod towards the calibre of work Emery did in Spain.In the post-Wenger world the next appointment was always going to feel pivotal. Loaded. For the triumvirate put together by the chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, to make the key footballing decisions, this process has been a test for a new team behind the team. Gazidis has been working with Raúl Sanllehí (head of football relations) and Sven Mislintat (head of recruitment) for only a few months and they have knocked their heads together and come up with Emery.He is another football obsessive, a man who references “emotion” and “responsibility” when he thinks about his role – only this one has a different character to his predecessor.Arsenal’s players will return to London Colney for the new season to find an environment with cranked-up demands and expectations.Emery’s nature is to be meticulous, tactically smart, with a disciplinarian streak. He is minded to push his players. After a long time listening to the same manager, Arsenal’s squad will soon learn that there is no room for any complacency, for allowing themselves to go through any motions. They can also expect to be drilled into a more intense and resilient style. The force of an attitude shock, exactly what they need, will be felt. “Either we all work or let’s just burst the ball,” he says. That philosophy is a bit more George Graham than Arsène Wenger but given the requirement to shake up the comfort zone, to instil some defensive organisation, at this moment in time it’s no bad thing.Having been around several blocks (Arsenal would represent a seventh job in a fourth different country) Emery offers that weight of experience Mikel Arteta didn’t have. But his career has not pointed to long-term spells, with four seasons at Valencia his longest run in any one club, so that’s another change of pace Arsenal will have to get used to.It is all about building new relationships now, as quickly as possible. As well as getting to know his new players, Emery also has to develop some mutual trust with Gazidis, Sanllehí and Mislintat. There is adjustment to be done on the squad, even with the relatively limited funds available for a club hoping to compete with other teams vying for a Champions League finish. The process of deciding who to target, and who is expendable, is on the agenda during this shortened World Cup summer window.Best get to work, rather than bursting the ball."

Prince Harry’s bride-to-be, Meghan Markle, wasn’t the only public figure to front up on Thursday in a bid to explain to a curious English public why at least one key figure will be absent from an imminent event of major national and global significance. While she was telling us how much she cares for her father, who will not be present at her wedding, Gareth Southgate rocked up before the ladies and gentlemen of the fourth estate, to explain why Joe Hart, among others, will not be present at what promises to be an even bigger circus with far more comedy potential.Along with Ryan Bertrand, Hart is one of just two England players to suffer the indignity of making the 18-man England squad for the 2018 Fifa [Ethics] World Cup Russia World Cup™ Panini sticker album, only to be unceremoniously dropped from the actual 23-man England squad ahead of the 2018 Fifa [Ethics] World Cup Russia World Cup™ tournament. Although it is far from the first indignity Hart has suffered in recent months, Southgate said the decision to leave him out was a tough one. “Of course it was a difficult call,” explained the England manager. “But in the end I’ve got to look at performances over the last 18 months with their clubs, and the three lads we picked were the three best goalkeepers in the league this year.”While Southgate addressed the other high-profile absentees, including Jack Wilshere, he was also eager to sing the praises of those who will be given the opportunity to slink home from Kaliningrad in disgrace before the end of June. The baby of the group, Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold, was singled out for special praise on the back of Big Cup performances in which “he’s shown, in games of real pressure, the personality and the ability to cope with that”. The Fiver can only hope the teenager copes as maturely when certain newspapers inevitably get on his case for such heinous misdemeanours as buying his mam a nice house, going out for breakfast or shopping for inexpensive clothes.As tends to be the case at such gatherings where the England football team is being discussed, the very important subject of who will wear a nylon piece of elastic on one sleeve and call “heads” or “tails” raised its weary head. An office famously likened by Big Paper’s Royal Wedding correspondent Marina Hyde to that of a regimental goat, the identity of who will captain the football side remains a peculiarly English obsession. Southgate said he will “think about that in a bit more detail” when his avengers assemble before flying out to Russia. One suspects that whoever gets the gig will not have to lift anything heavier than team morale.“The boots tell a story of a modern Egyptian icon, performing in the UK, with a truly global impact” – Neal Spencer, the British museum’s keeper of ancient Egypt and Sudan, on a pair of Mo Salah’s boots being donated for an exhibition.

Rui Faria is to leave Manchester United at the end of the season. The assistant manager has worked alongside José Mourinho at Old Trafford since 2016, having also been on his coaching staff during his spells at Chelsea, Porto, Internazionale and Real Madrid.Mourinho said: “Seventeen years… in Leiria, Porto, London, Milan, Madrid, London again and Manchester. Training, playing, travelling, studying, laughing and also a few tears of happiness. Seventeen years and the kid is now a man. The intelligent student is now a football expert, ready for a successful career as a manager.“I will miss my friend and that is the hardest thing for me but his happiness is more important and I respect his decision, especially because I know we will always be together. Be happy, brother!”In a statement on the United website, Faria said: “After a lot of consideration and with a very heavy heart I have decided the time is right to move on. I have had 17 years of incredible and unforgettable experiences. However, I have felt for some time I would like to spend much more quality time with my family before pursuing any new challenge in my professional life.“My heartfelt thanks go to José Mourinho for the belief he had in me all those years ago when it all was just a student dream. I would like to thank him for the opportunity and confidence, for the knowledge and experience, but most importantly for his friendship.”Kieran McKenna, United’s under-18s head coach, is in the frame to join Mourinho’s staff when Faria departs. The Northern Irishman joined two years ago from Tottenham Hotspur, where he was a youth coach, and won the under-18s championship this season."

Pre-season prediction 6th; Current position: 6thHaving papered over the cracks with cup wins in recent seasons, there was no bridging the chasm between first and sixth this time. Grim away showings illustrated Arsène Wenger’s fading motivational capacity. But at least – after the hopes of a fairytale ending were quashed by Diego Simeone – we had a final bit of Wengerball against Burnley, giving Le Gaffer a fitting send-off at the Grove. All in all, though, 5/10 is about right.Stars/flops There were a few tantalising hints that Aubameyang might deliver. Otherwise the only positives were unexpected goals and assists from Monreal and the fresh blood: Reiss Nelson, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Konstantinos Mavropanos. The rest went through the motions, while Hector Bellerín and Alex Iwobi went backwards.Summer targets We need a manager who’ll focus on building from the back. One who’ll hopefully prioritise a world-class, dominant presence between the posts, a replacement for Laurent Koscielny (if we haven’t already found one in Mavropanos – Sven Mislintat’s first discovery?) and a dedicated defensive midfielder whose only ambition is to protect and serve.Best and worst away fans The invasion of 20,000 Cologne fans certainly made an impression. Credit also to Burnley for their chorus of “Only one Arsène Wenger” (after chiding us with “You’re only here for the T-shirts”).Moment that made you smile For all the emotion of Arsène’s leaving do, there was huge relief at having been put out of his and our misery. For the first time in two decades, we’re going in to a summer feeling eager anticipation, without a scooby of what it might bring.– Bernard Azulay goonersdiary.co.uk; @GoonerN5Pre-season prediction 10th; Current position: 12thIt’s been a struggle – it feels like some of this squad may have had their last season here. But while it hasn’t been a comfortable ride, Eddie Howe did well to pull the team out of the bottom three, and there were great wins against Arsenal and Chelsea. One of the club’s biggest problems now, though, is keeping up with fans’ expectations. Just staying up is no longer seen as making progress. 6/10Stars/flops Nathan Aké and Lewis Cook are the two players that really excelled, but Asmir Begovic and Ryan Fraser have had decent seasons, too. As for flops – Jermain Defoe never found his form. Apart for a brief flash against Crystal Palace, he hasn’t looked like he fits in yet with the team.Summer targets There have been lots of rumours about a £12m move for Bristol City striker Bobby Reid – but Howe also has to find some young defenders, even though our own Jack Simpson is ready to step up. In midfield, Chelsea’s Kenedy and Fulham’s Tom Cairney would be on my list.Best and worst away fans The worst were Stoke – they never have anything good to say about any other team, and they really won’t be missed. The best were Liverpool, who do show respect and are keen to talk football.Moment that made you smile Those interview analogies from Carlos Carvalhal were amusing – an improvement on the standard press conference lines. Shame he’s not sticking around.– Peter Bell afcbchimes.blogspot.co.uk; @CherryChimes.co.ukPre-season prediction 10th; Current position: 14thA fantastic season. The brilliant group of players that got us promoted gelled with some superb new signings and they all worked their socks off under Chris Hughton, who must be manager of the year. Securing our Premier League status by beating Manchester United in our last home game was a dream come true. 9/10Stars/flops So many stars … new boys Pascal Gross, Maty Ryan, Davy Pröpper, José Izquierdo and Ezequiel Schelotto. But then our oldies – Bruno, Gaëtan Bong and Glenn Murray – were outstanding, too, as were Lewis Dunk, Shane Duffy and Dale Stephens. Anthony Knockaert, meanwhile, saved it for the last game – he was on fire against United and should take that outstanding display into next season, when hopefully we will see more of Jürgen Locadia.Summer targets We could strengthen, but given the shrewd way the club is run and the success of our under 23s, we have probably got it all covered. And our 22-year-old goalkeeper Christian Walton, on loan at Wigan, won the League One golden glove.Best and worst away fans Everyone loves coming to the Amex. Manchester City fans were the happiest. Crystal Palace were the worst, again.Moment that made you smile We were 2-0 down at Huddersfield, it was snowing, and everyone sang: “If you hate Palace, take off your shoes,” and waved them in the air.– Steph Fincham Observer readerPre-season prediction 14th; Current position: 7thIt’s been absolutely brilliant – way beyond anything we could have dared hope for. Back in August I was just looking for us to avoid relegation worries, but it went way past that, and now we find ourselves in Europe. Sean Dyche continues to prove himself a tremendous manager for us. His decision in January to sign a new deal was the best news possible. 10/10Stars/flops It’s always difficult to pick out stars here because it’s all based on team performance. But it would be wrong not to single out Nick Pope and James Tarkowski, who earned deserved England calls. The only possible flops are last summer’s signings Jon Walters and Nahki Wells – but both, particularly Walters, have been held back by injuries.Summer targets I’m sure we’ll have a central defender on the list, and we’ll probably also need another striker. It’s just about adding layers to build up the squad.Best and worst away fans Many have filled the away end and some added to the atmosphere. Manchester United were probably the noisiest. The worst were Swansea – they just didn’t turn up.Moment that made you smile Half-time on the opening day of the season at Chelsea, staring at the big screen showing the scoreline CHELSEA 0 BURNLEY 3. Even then, we couldn’t have known at the time just how good the season was going to be.– Tony Scholes UpTheClarets.com; @UTCdotcomPre-season prediction 2nd; Current position: 5thA frustrating nine months. Relationships have broken down between manager and board, manager and players and, to a degree, manager and fans. Antonio Conte has gone from charming to brooding, stubborn and scowling: it’s all rather familiar. The FA Cup is still up for grabs but, as we know only too well, José Mourinho has a habit of winning cups. Conte sadly doesn’t. 5/10Stars/flops N’Golo Kanté once again shone, and Olivier Giroud made a difference. Eden Hazard has been inconsistent, though we’d be lost without him, while Álvaro Morata is our outstanding flop. Boy did he flop – dramatically, on to his backside mostly. Sometimes, you just know that the fit isn’t right.Summer targets As good as Giroud has been, we still need a striker – possibly even two. Players who have a firm grip on gravity, ideally. We also need some quality to replace Victor Moses (Davide Zappacosta is not the answer), a younger Cesc Fàbregas and some more steel: as a team we are too lightweight. We need players who are happy to mix it up when necessary – John Terry, Didier Drogba, Diego Costa, Michael Ballack, even Frank Lampard were never bullied.Best and worst away fans Roma were loud and energetic, showing how much grounds in this country have been sterilised. Arsenal were like tourists.Moment that made you smile Giroud’s FA Cup goal against Southampton – like an action scene from Platoon, the Saints players falling in his wake as our new favourite hipster took them out. And David Luiz’s fancy‑dress birthday party also guaranteed a snigger or two. Special mention to Pedro for going as Harley Quinn. Fully admire his “go big or go home” attitude.– Trizia Fiorellino ChelseaSupportersGroup.netPre-season prediction 12th; Current position: 11thAs everyone knows by now, in mid-October we were on zero wins, seven defeats and zero goals. So to be going into the final day with a chance of a top-half finish is just astonishing. And it’s all happened despite the most crippling injury list ever seen at Palace, our only striker forgetting how to score, and a dire transfer window. What a job Roy Hodgson has done. 8/10Stars/flops Wilfried Zaha has been the shining light: we didn’t win a game without him. Luka Milivojevic led by example, James Tomkins was a stalwart, and academy product Aaron Wan-Bissaka made a great start. As for flops: three goals from Christian Benteke all season is simply not acceptable, and surely means his departure. And if anyone knows why we signed Erdal Rakip from Benfica on loan in January, I’d love to hear it.Summer targets We’ve already lined up a very good keeper in Vicente Guaita, who joins in July. But strikers, more than one, are an absolute priority. Another winger wouldn’t go amiss either – someone like Michail Antonio or Ademola Lookman. The dream signing would be to bring in Ruben Loftus-Cheek on a permanent transfer. It’s been a pleasure to see him develop into a player who looks destined to board the plane to Russia.Best and worst away fans Huddersfield sang their hearts out, loving the 3-0 massacring they inflicted on us. But Man City gave their side no backing when they were under the cosh.Moment that made you smile Milivojevic giving Benteke the ball to take a late penalty in April when we were 4-0 up against Leicester. It almost brought a tear to the eye.– Chris Waters PalaceTrust.org.uk; @Clapham_GrandPre-season prediction 6th; Current position: 8thBack in August there was real optimism. With Ronald Koeman in charge from the start and plenty of new signings in, I was confident we’d consolidate this season, make it into the top six and do well in the Europa League. It didn’t quite work out that way. Two months later we were at the wrong end of the league, embarrassed in Europe, and looking for a new manager. David Unsworth came in as caretaker for a few games before the board picked Sam Allardyce – who is comfortably worse than both of them. 2/10Stars/flops Jordan Pickford has been outstanding in goal, and should, without doubt, be England’s No 1 this summer. New signing Cenk Tosun has done well too, when he’s had some service. Allardyce has to be our top flop – he’s all “me, me, me” and just doesn’t get Everton. Yannick Bolasie, meanwhile, is a circus act.Summer targets Just one: a new manager. Anyone in place of Allardyce.Best and worst away fans The best were Huddersfield, who never stopped singing. Hajduk Split fans were awful.Moment that made you smile Seeing Séamus Coleman return to the side in January after his horrific broken leg. His last-minute sprint when he outpaced two players to get a cross in was wonderful. A marvellous Evertonian.– Steve Jones @BlueKippercomPre-season prediction 16th; Current position: 16thShutting out the champions then drawing at Stamford Bridge was quite some way to stay up. It’s the latest in a series of remarkable achievements over the last two years from a club that’s always being written off. David Wagner has given us this brilliant ability to come up with the goods when the chips are down. He’s not only the reason we survived, but he is why we’re here in the first place. Get that man a statue! 10/10Stars/flops Last year’s play-off hero and demigod Christopher Schindler has been an absolute rock at the back and is one of the most underrated players in the Premier League. It didn’t work out for Scott Malone, though. He tore us apart last season when playing for Fulham, but has looked a long, long way off the level we’re at now.Summer targets If we could get Terence Kongolo on a permanent deal it’d be an absolute coup and solve our left-back problem. We also need serious pace up top and on the wings. Steve Mounié and Laurent Depoitre have been great but both are target men, so our play can get one dimensional.Best and worst away fans Liverpool were very disappointing considering their reputation. West Ham enjoyed thrashing us. “We’re West Ham United, we clap with our hands” in reference to our ‘clappers’ made me chuckle.Moment that made you smile Our FA Cup tie against Manchester United when the VAR system produced wobbly lines for an offside decision … Keep VAR out of our beautiful game.– Alex Taylor @AlexJT27Huddersfield can count themselves unfortunate on that second Lukaku goal. Would've been ruled out with VAR. pic.twitter.com/4S1gzHFusQPre-season prediction 7th; Current position: 9thOn the surface it looks like a relative success, but our league position belies our quality. I predicted that if we abandoned our style we’d struggle, and Claude Puel’s unpopular revolution has proven that to be true. It’s incredible that, given the dirge we’ve endured this season, we’ve been so comfortable in the table. The bottom half must be truly diabolical … I’ll give it 6/10 for the season; 3/10 for the manager.Stars/flops Jamie Vardy was robbed of the official player of the year award, won by Harry Maguire. Without Vardy’s goals who knows where we’d be now. As for flops: he’ll for ever be our greatest ever captain but Wes Morgan has well and truly entered the twilight of his career. Kasper Schmeichel has also seen a remarkable dip in form.Summer targets Recruitment is crucial for us this year, with Riyad Mahrez surely on his way. The unrelenting push for a new brand of football and an ageing squad means we could do with reinforcing every position on the pitch.Best and worst away fans Newcastle were best, but they played us off the park and Sunderland had just gone down, so they had every reason to be chipper. Southampton were disappointing.Moment that made you smile When the visiting Spurs fans were goading Vardy with crude chants about his wife’s appearance on I’m a Celebrity, only for him to rifle home a beautiful volley. It shut them up mid-sentence.– Chris Whiting TheChrisWhitingShow.wordpress.com; @ChrisRWhitingPre-season prediction 1st; Current position: 4thWe’ve had worse. We didn’t quite make the top spot and we need a point today to guarantee a top-four finish – though of course if we do it right in Kiev that won’t matter. This really is Jürgen Klopp’s team now, with all the rollercoaster rides that brings. He has made us a united force, and he gave City a masterclass in tactics away in the Champions League. After today, Kiev here we come! 9/10Stars/flops No real flops: we’ve improved massively as a unit. Trent Alexander-Arnold has learned fast, Andy Robertson has been phenomenal, Virgil van Dijk looks like he’s played at the back for us for ever and James Milner is revitalised. Sadio Mané is back to his best at just the right time, and I can’t heap high enough praise on Bobby Firmino. Oh, and then there’s Mo Salah.Summer targets I was keen on Roma keeper Alisson until we put seven past him. It’d be great to have another defender on Van Dijk’s level – Toby Alderweireld? And we need more in midfield. Naby Keita is coming but it’d be great if Nice’s Jean Seri joined him.Best and worst away fans The best were all those who don’t whine about our lack of “famous atmosphere”. As ever, usual suspects for worst, but a special mention to Stoke and their fiver-waving antics.Moment that made you smile Hearing the ref’s whistle after what seemed like the hundred and ninety‑eighth minute away to Roma.– Steph Jones Observer reader• Part 2: Manchester City to West Ham"

Queens Park Rangers have appointed Steve McClaren as manager in place of Ian Holloway, sacked after the club finished 16th in the Championship.McClaren has agreed a two-year contract at Loftus Road, having briefly worked at QPR as a first-team coach with Harry Redknapp in 2013. The 57-year-old has been away from English football since leaving Derby in March last year, with his last role as a consultant for Maccabi Tel-Aviv in Israel.“It’s great to be back – and it’s a challenge that I’m excited by,” McClaren told the club’s website. “I’ve followed the club closely over the last five years, because of the three months I had here. From the outside I’ve seen the progress, work and changes that have gone on in streamlining the squad and getting the budget down. The board and owners deserve credit for that.“The introduction of younger players has been a breath of fresh air and it’s exciting for the future,” the former England manager added. “I like to play attractive, attacking football – and we’ve got young, hungry footballers here who can play that way.”Les Ferdinand, the club’s director of football, said McClaren is “the perfect fit” for QPR. “[Steve] has a fantastic reputation in the game for coaching and developing players,” he said.“When you look at the average age of our squad, and the exciting young talent starting to emerge, he is the perfect fit for us. We want Steve to use his expertise and experience to help our players grow.”QPR are the seventh club McClaren has managed in a nomadic coaching career. He won the Eredivisie with FC Twente and led Derby to the 2014 Championship play-off final – where they lost to QPR – but lasted only nine months at Newcastle and just 10 league games at Nottingham Forest. "

The word from Barcelona is that the club will make space for Antoine Griezmann this summer by selling Luis Suárez. Brendan Rodgers and Steven Gerrard are believed to be preparing their pitches right now, each texting the Uruguayan striker photos of their Luis Suárez tattoos and promising him that he won’t miss the Barcelona-Real Madrid derbies once he experiences the joys of El Glasigo. Sadly, Suárez in an Old Firm clash is a treat we are never likely to witness because Paris Saint-German can offer both him and Barça more lolly. But that doesn’t mean Rodgers and Gerrard can’t keep arguing over who Suárez loves most.Celtic left-back Kieran Tierney is enjoying that spectacle so much that he is said to have no interest in leaving for Bournemouth, who will put that theory to the test by submitting a £20m offer. Meanwhile, if Suárez does move to Paris, then he could hook up with his compatriot Edinson Cavani, who insists he is staying in the French capital despite claims he was intent on leaving this summer for Chelsea or anywhere else. “My future is here, of course,” said Cavani, fuelling speculation that Neymar is off to Real Madrid. Atlético Madrid, meanwhile, are focusing on luring Sergio Agüero back from Manchester City. And City sense they are close to striking a deal for Napoli’s Jorginho. By contrast, and contrary to reports this week in France, Nabil Fekir’s father has said no deal has been done between his son and Liverpool. Other reports in France, meanwhile, claim Liverpool have their hearts set on Bordeaux’s Brazilian forward Malcom, who is also being wooed by Manchester United and Tottenham. Juventus want to take Álvaro Morata away from Chelsea on a season-long loan. Everton are planning to rejuvenate their defence by prising Jamaal Lascelles away from Newcastle, a move that could push Rafael Benítez to the end of his tether. Having seen the state of the Premier League, Wolves are preparing for a European campaign in 2019-20. They plan to bolster their squad by bringing in striker André Silva from Milan and the goalkeeper Rui Patricio from Sporting Lisbon and are willing to outbid Napoli for the latter. If they fail in that they may move for PSG goalkeeper Kevin Trapp. Hurrahs in Italy suggest that Internazionale have beaten Liverpool, Spurs and everyone else to the signature of Stefan de Vrij, the centre-back whose contract with Lazio expires in a month. Gareth Southgate is planning to include two uncapped youngsters in his England World Cup squad: Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dortmund’s 18-year-old winger Jadon Sancho. Finally, Fulham, Aston Villa and Sheffield Wednesday all hope to find the sweet spot of Sunderland’s George Honeyman. "

football,"Chelsea can win the Women’s Super League on Tuesday to crown a season in which their experience, squad depth and goalscoring powers have given them the edge
Suzanne Wrack

The final Women’s Super League One season before the autumn rebrand and restructure draws to a close this weekend. On Tuesday night, Chelsea will be crowned champions with one game to play if they avoid defeat at Bristol City. That is not a conclusion everyone had seen coming.At the end of January the top tier looked very much like the men’s Premier League. Manchester City were dominant, having won all seven league games and 17 in a row across three competitions. Although Chelsea had dropped two points, it felt as though the title was City’s to lose.Since then, however, Nick Cushing’s City side have picked up 11 points from a possible 27, fewer than Birmingham, Chelsea, Reading, Arsenal and sixth-placed Liverpool. They lost the League Cup final against Arsenal and, whereas Chelsea remain unbeaten in the league, City have lost four games, crumbling at the business end – three of those coming in their past five matches.Now, with two games to play, they sit six points below Emma Hayes’s Chelsea. So where did it go wrong?It is fairly simple. Whereas Chelsea have built a deep and experienced squad capable of competing on all fronts, City have not. Both sides have lost players to injury, some long-term, yet Hayes has still been able to rotate and has always had someone capable of stepping into the breach – most notably Maren Mjelde moving into the back four from midfield with ease.Whereas the average age of defenders used by Chelsea is 26, City’s is 24. The midfield average age gap is even bigger, Chelsea’s 27 to City’s 24. City’s team is young and their squad is younger.So while Chelsea have been able to rely on experience in their backline (players range from 24 to 33 outside their most-used back-four) City have had the talented but less experienced Mie Jans, 24, Megan Campbell, 24, and Esme Morgan, 17, to fall back on. Chelsea’s more experienced regular defence have this season played 13 fewer games between them than City’s over-relied-on back four of Jen Beattie, Abbie McManus, Demi Stokes and Steph Houghton.In midfield the problem is the same: four Chelsea players have played fewer than 28 games this season (only the veteran Katie Chapman reached 29) as Hayes has rotated to deal with the fixture pile-up caused by the team’s progress in two domestic cups and to the Champions League semis. At City, three midfielders have played more than 28 games, with 21-year-old Kiera Walsh playing 34 across all competitions. No wonder City players have started to show signs of fatigue.Both sides have a wealth of attacking talent but City have lacked a real goalscorer. Fran Kirby has 25 goals for Chelsea as part of a potent frontline, all of whom have chipped in. But City have not had a stand-out player up front. They brought in German forward Pauline Bremer from Lyon in exchange for arguably the world’s best right-back, Lucy Bronze, in the summer, but three games in, and after she had scored her first goal, Bremer suffered a horrific leg break.As the margins City were winning by began to shrink, Cushing turned to the Portland Thorns and Denmark forward Nadia Nadim in the January transfer window. After scoring six minutes into her debut against Reading, then the winner in City’s Continental Cup semi against Chelsea, she looked to have settled in well. But she trailed off disappointingly, making six starts and scoring two goals in 14 appearances. City allowed Toni Duggan to leave for Barcelona in the summer and with the striker finishing as Barça’s top scorer, with 14 goals in all competitions, their failure to recruit suitable back-up or to deepen the squad seems to have been costly.Chelsea won the FA Cup final this month and if they wrap up the double on Tuesday, or at Liverpool on Sunday, they will be worthy winners. Their exciting, interchangeable attack has been anchored by a rock-solid defence, and City have struggled to play with as much verve.Even if Chelsea seal the title on Tuesday there will be much to play for behind them. The restructure of the pyramid means there will be no relegation but at the top end three points separate second and fifth. If City continue their slide they run the risk of finishing without a trophy and outside the two Champions League places, with Arsenal on their heels and Reading still with an outside chance.Anyone pining for football now the Premier League season has finished could do a lot worse than watching a gripping WSL1 term reach its conclusion.• Doncaster Rovers Belles won Women’s Super League Two after Durham put four past title-chasing Brighton. Belles celebrated with a win against third-place Millwall, Jade Pennock’s strike taking a heavy deflection to inflict Millwall’s first home defeat since February 2017. Belles’ striker Jessica Sigsworth is on course to finish as WSL2’s top scorer; she has 11 goals, one more than team-mate Kirsty Hanson and Durham’s Beth Hepple with a game to play.• Lyon secured the Division 1 Féminine title for a record 16th time and 12th in a row. They sealed the title without dropping a point, scoring 98 goals and conceding five, a 7-0 win against Marseille pulling them out of reach of Paris St-Germain. Lyon face PSG in their final game before travelling to Kiev to play Wolfsburg in the Champions League final as they aim for another treble.• Atlético Madrid saw off Barcelona to retain their La Liga Iberdrola title by one point. Atlético beat Zaragoza 6-1 on the final day while Barcelona put five past Levante. Barcelona, having recruited hard, including Toni Duggan from Manchester City and the Euro 2017 winner Lieke Martens, were favourites to pip Atlético to top spot. Atleti have announced the signing of this season’s top scorer Charlyn Corral from Levante.• New Zealand Football and the NZ Professional Footballers’ Association have negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement that gives the women’s national team equal pay, equal prize money, equal rights for image use and, crucially, travel parity when representing the country."

There might be quite a few people who are surprised to learn the identity of the player in Gareth Southgate’s squad who will be going to Russia for the World Cup as the leading scorer within the England setup. But here’s a clue: it is not Harry Kane. Or not yet, anyway.Perhaps this might also be an appropriate moment to point out that Danny Welbeck – one of the players who regularly seems to get the pitchfork treatment on social media – has managed more goals in England’s colours than Jamie Vardy, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford put together. Fifteen, in total, from 37 appearances, though on only 10 occasions has he has played the full 90 minutes. Kane is next in line, with 12 goals from 23 caps (13 full appearances). Nobody else is in double figures and it is worth bearing in mind that four different England managers – Southgate, Roy Hodgson, Fabio Capello and Stuart Pearce on caretaker duty – have selected Welbeck in his seven years as an international footballer. When he is fit, he tends to get the call.Unfortunately for Welbeck, that has not been as often as he would have liked since he signed for Arsenal from Manchester United in 2014. First it was the cartilage in his left knee that required major surgery. Then it was a similar problem in his right knee and another long, demoralising layoff. Welbeck missed Euro 2016 because of the second operation and it does not need long in his company to realise these have been the hardest times of his career.“It’s not been easy to deal with,” he says. “It’s difficult. It’s a lonely period. You are not out on the pitch helping your team-mates and doing what you love doing. I had so much time on my hands. Straight after surgery I couldn’t put any weight on my leg for two months. I went through a period of not even leaving my house. Then, after six weeks, when I went back to training, I was literally going just there and straight back home, reading books and stuff like that. But you can learn about yourself and improve mentally. I read more books than when I was in school. Sports mentality books and autobiographies.”He had every reason to feel sorry for himself and to think this mountain is too big. What he has done is exceptionalUndisputed Truth, the autobiography of Mike Tyson, was a favourite – “He’s a fighter, he’s a mad man … I’m not just a fighter, I like to give love as well. I’m a lover too. But I liked that one.”The book he really benefited from, however, was Relentless – From Good to Great to Unstoppable, detailing Tim Grover’s work with Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and some of basketball’s other stars. “I really enjoyed that one. It also helped me through that period because it talks about being injured and making your way back into the game.”The issue now is whether Welbeck can be considered back to his best and, realistically, his total of 10 goals from 43 Arsenal appearances last season means he is unlikely to be in Southgate’s starting XI when England begin their penultimate warm-up game for the World Cup with Saturday’s friendly against Nigeria.“What would you class as your best?” is his answer to that one. “There is always room to improve. When you come back, you are not going to be fighting fit, you are not going to be as sharp as you have been straight from the start. It doesn’t happen with a click of the fingers. You have to do it in stages and work really, really hard at it.”All of which helps to explain why Arsène Wenger, in his last few weeks at Arsenal, was so effusive in his praise of the player. “This guy has gone through some difficult times,” the former manager said. “And I’ve seen him behave when it was really hard and tough, so he deserves everything he gets.“He had every reason to feel sorry for himself and to think this mountain is too big to climb. Because he had the right knee, the left knee, almost a year out every time and having to work hard, unnoticed by everybody. People were questioning: ‘Will he come back or not?’ It’s the most difficult test for any sportsperson. I believe what he has done is exceptional.”At 27, a “veteran” of the last World Cup, Welbeck is one of the older players picked by Southgate in a squad chosen with pace in mind. “We’ve not had a race but, put it this way, there are a lot of players who would back themselves. Over 100 metres Raheem would be rapid out of the blocks – say, the first 10 yards. Then there are a few boys that would catch him up and take him over. Marcus is quick, Kyle Walker … I have not seen Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] really go for it yet, but he might be quick.” Welbeck, one imagines, might fancy his chances too.Not Jack Wilshere, though. Welbeck can sympathise with his Arsenal team-mate, another player who knows a thing or two about long-term injuries, about not being selected – “Jack is a really good friend of mine and I know he is disappointed” – and he nods in agreement when it is put to him that a decent World Cup would be one way to impress the club’s new manager, Unai Emery.“Obviously it is exciting times at the club. It was a bit strange with the manager [Wenger] announcing that he was leaving and not knowing who was next. Now it has been announced I am looking forward to working with him next season. But my main focus, being with England, is the World Cup now.”"

West Ham are ready to make a formal approach for Rafael Benítez and are giving serious consideration to triggering the £6m release clause in the Newcastle United manager’s contract.Benítez is the first choice to replace David Moyes but West Ham want to keep their options open and retain a strong interest in Manuel Pellegrini. While they have denied a report in Chile claiming that the former Manchester City coach is set to be unveiled in London, they want to speak to him. Newcastle’s manager, however, remains West Ham’s No 1 choice and there is increasing concern on Tyneside that Benítez will move if he receives a satisfactory offer.Although West Ham have misgivings about how much it will cost in compensation there is an increasing belief Benítez would represent value for money. Given he is in the final year of his Newcastle contract, lawyers may end up ensuring the release clause is less than £6m, his annual salary.West Ham have long admired Benítez and almost appointed him after parting company with Sam Allardyce three years ago, only for Real Madrid to step in. The two parties have remained on good terms and West Ham are hoping to capitalise on Benítez’s growing dissatisfaction at Newcastle, who have yet to commit to giving him more transfer backing.There will be complications to iron out before a deal can be agreed. West Ham are concerned there will be further compensation if Benítez ends his spell on Tyneside and have been told the Spaniard wants his contract to contain a large severance package. They would also have to convince him that he will receive funds to strengthen an unbalanced squad. It is understood that Moyes was dissatisfied with the money available for summer signings. West Ham have said they expected to appoint a manager within the next seven days.Benítez is well aware of the sometimes poisonous politics at West Ham but any semblance of trust in an always remote relationship with Mike Ashley, Newcastle’s owner, has been eroded after a series of transfer-market promises were broken last summer.Ashley is desperate for Benítez to remain and extend his contract, not least because having the former Champions League-winning manager in place could help him in his ambition to sell Newcastle for as much as £400m. In order for him to stay put in the north-east, Benítez would need guarantees as to his transfer budget and proposed improvements to Newcastle’s training ground and academy. His desire to sign some experienced players over the age of 26 has long been a sticking point with Ashley, who prefers to recruit younger professionals with greater sell-on potential.Benítez and Ashley have not met for talks, with negotiations being conducted by phone and email between the former Liverpool manager’s representatives and Lee Charnley, Newcastle’s managing director.David Sullivan, the West Ham co-chairman, interviewed Paulo Fonseca at his Essex home on Monday but it has emerged the Portuguese has extended his contract with Shakhtar Donetsk.West Ham have also been offered a chance to speak to Claudio Ranieri. The Italian, who led Leicester City to the Premier League title in 2016, is available after being sacked by Nantes. West Ham will consider Ranieri if they cannot attract one of their favoured candidates."

Jürgen Klopp knew we had met before but, at Liverpool’s training ground last month, he could not recall the exact setting of our first interview. The answer made him groan. Five years ago this month in Dortmund, 10 days before the 2013 Champions League final at Wembley, Klopp had been in a sparkling mood. As he prepared to lead Borussia Dortmund against Bayern Munich in an all-German battle for European football’s greatest prize, he offered engaging insights into his managerial style while urging the neutral fan to support his team.“If you want the new story, the special story, it must be Dortmund,” Klopp said. “You have to be on our side.” Five years on, with neutrals enraptured again as Klopp inspires an often thrilling Liverpool to Saturday’s Champions League final in Kiev against Real Madrid, his charisma was equally obvious. But before Klopp could engage with subjects ranging from football to politics he remembered how Dortmund had conceded the winning goal in the 89th minute against Bayern.“It was too painful,” he said softly. “I’ve cancelled pretty much everything around that game and never watched it back.” He shook his head and repeated one word. “Never.”In that moment it was possible to sense the depth of Klopp’s desire to win the Champions League. He might be the most likable of interviewees but this quest for success drives him. It hurts to have won only one of the six cup finals in which his teams have played. In 2012, in his first, Dortmund beat Bayern 5-2 in the German Cup. He has since lost five in a row. That curious statistic is less interesting than the way in which he galvanises his teams.I also interviewed Marco Reus in 2013 and the Dortmund forward responded simply when asked how Klopp helped the team. “He makes us happy,” Reus said.In a more layered way Andy Robertson, the Liverpool left-back who has been a revelation since Klopp signed him from Hull 11 months ago, told me last week how “the gaffer uses humour very cleverly. If he feels the lads are uptight or things aren’t going our way he’ll relieve the tension. He’ll crack a joke or you’ll hear his big laugh. He’s a fantastic manager who knows exactly what to do and when to do it. His personality is so good that when you see him on the touchline you just want to run for him. You want to tackle for him, you want to do well for him. But, most of all, he’s a calming influence.”Klopp’s calm in a one-to-one setting, even more than his humour or warmth, remains my clearest impression from our interviews. Rather than a joker or cheerleader, he is a bright thinker with an even deeper emotional intelligence which enables him to connect powerfully with people.He spoke so fondly of his players, I wondered if he felt like a father to some of them? “A stepfather,” he exclaimed before becoming more reflective. “Look, I am an absolutely normal guy and sometimes I want be their friend. Sometimes I have to be a teacher. It’s not so difficult to find a moment to be a friend or … well … [Klopp laughed] a North Korean dictator.”“My biggest skill is common sense. It’s important they understand football is only one part of life. Coming into a Champions League final you tell them to appreciate this moment. Of course they are young and considered superstars. But in big moments they need help to find calm. It’s not important if you won or lost the last game, if you played well or kicked the ball like your grandmother. I need to help settle their heads and hearts before such a massive match.”In Dortmund Klopp had smiled when hearing Reus’s quote about happiness. “What they discover when they leave the club is that we have a very special dressing room. The secret of a manager like Alex Ferguson comes through when you hear what former players say about him. They can have had boots flying in their face like David Beckham but they still love the idea they were coached by him. That’s the biggest honour or accolade you can give to a coach.“It’s important you have maximum respect for your players but remember you are the guy who is most responsible. As managers we all have rules and so there is no discussion with my players about how much we train … But in every other case they can come to me with a problem and if I have a solution I will help them. If I don’t know I bring in someone else to find an answer. On the pitch, it’s work. But football without fun is not great. If we don’t have some fun it would be strange. Are we not lucky guys? We are so silly when we get too worried about football. It’s not too serious and I don’t see the point of being at war with the team.”We were the first team in Germany to play 4-4-2 without a libero. It was the best thing I ever learnt about footballThe sense of fun and pleasure that ripples through Klopp would be meaningless without the work and intensity that characterises his best teams. He also places great store in tactics and, as he told me in Dortmund: “My first inspiration was Wolfgang Frank – my coach for years in the second division with Mainz. He took his inspiration from Arrigo Sacchi [who managed Milan to successive European Cup final victories in 1989 and 1990]. We were the first team in Germany to play 4-4-2 without a libero. It was the best thing I ever learned about football. Before we looked at Sacchi’s methods we used to think if the other players are better you have to lose. But we learned you can beat a better team by using tactics.“What Sacchi did with Maldini, Baresi, Costacurta and Tassotti was amazing. There was a video of them training and with Wolfgang Frank we watched it 500 times. They put sticks in the field and had to move in formation like birds … wooomf … wooomf … training without the ball. No one in Germany did this. In Germany you either run until you [Klopp pretended to vomit] or play football – nothing between. No tactics. Then we saw this. It was boring but one of the best coaches in the world, maybe the best, does this with the best players – because it’s necessary. So we did it. With a team that was in danger of going down to the third division; in another six months we were the best team in the second division.”Liverpool’s defence might be their undoing in Kiev – but Klopp’s trademark lightning transitions and the breathtaking prowess of his front three mean he has a real chance of breaking his losing streak in cup finals. The unity and conviction that surged through Liverpool against Manchester City in the quarter-finals and at home against Roma in the semi-final seem rooted in the close bond he forges with his players.In both interviews he spoke about how, at Dortmund, he did not show his team videos of Barcelona scoring beautiful goals. Instead, he showed them “photographs of Messi and his team-mates celebrating every goal like it’s the first they’ve ever scored. I don’t use videos because I don’t copy Barça’s style. But you see them celebrate goal number 5,868 like they’ve never scored before. This is what you should always feel – until you die.”Such joy means there is heartache when Klopp loses players to richer clubs. He was only half-joking when he told me how: “We cried for 20 minutes, in each other’s arms, when Shinji Kagawa left Dortmund for Manchester United,” and how “it was like a heart attack” after Mario Götze agreed to join Bayern Munich.Since Philippe Coutinho left Liverpool in January for Barcelona, Klopp has been hugely impressive in improving the team without their former star player. Tactical acumen, astute signings and Klopp’s enduring motivational powers mean Coutinho has hardly been missed.Klopp’s seemingly magical touch is felt throughout the club. It was instructive last month to see the warmth of his interaction with the tea lady and to hear snippets from Liverpool staff. One of them told me how Klopp might be the first person on the dance floor at a club function but, as soon as everyone joins in, he retreats discreetly to watch with beaming pride.His charm works and, in Dortmund, he convinced me “this is a very special club – a workers’ club” as he railed, wittily, against Bayern’s economic powerhouse. Of course he would have laughed at the irony that, when the interview ran in the Guardian, we had to feature this tagline: “Jürgen Klopp is proud to wear Puma – a partner of Borussia Dortmund.” There was no sponsor involvement when I met Klopp in Liverpool and his pleasure in football and life echoed again. “How can you not love this club, this city, these players?” he asked.Five years ago Klopp said: “I got more in life than I was ever supposed to get – family, money, football. None of my teachers, or my parents, ever believed this would happen to me. So how can this perfect life be spoilt because they take our players?”Life is never perfect, in Dortmund or Liverpool, and Klopp knows that glory in a Champions League final can be painfully elusive. But, whether Liverpool win or lose in Kiev, he will be back for another crack next season – while making his players happy as, yet again, they run and tackle and try their hearts out for him."

Graham Potter has been interviewed by Swansea City with a view to being appointed their new manager. The 43-year-old, who has enjoyed remarkable success with the Swedish club Östersund, held talks with Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, Swansea’s majority shareholders, and is now the leading contender to take over at the Liberty Stadium.Frank de Boer and Jaap Stam have also been interviewed for a position that became vacant after Swansea parted company with Carlos Carvalhal on Friday, in the wake of their relegation to the Championship. Although Brentford’s Dean Smith and Bristol City’s Lee Johnson have also come under consideration, neither is believed to be in the running as Swansea move towards appointing their fifth manager in 19 months.Potter is the standout candidate. He has spent the past seven years working in Sweden, where he has transformed the fortunes of Östersund, taking them from the fourth tier to the top flight in a story that has captured the imagination. He won the Swedish Cup with Östersund in 2017 and led the club to the last 32 of the Europa League earlier this year, knocking out Galatasaray, beating Hertha Berlin and drawing with Athletic Bilbao, before losing 4-2 on aggregate to Arsenal.Although Potter has not managed outside Sweden, his work at Östersund is likely to appeal to Swansea at a time when they are looking to bring in a young and dynamic coach to re-energise a club that has lost its identity on and off the field.De Boer has been in the frame for the manager’s position at Swansea before and the Dutchman, who has been out of work since being sacked by Crystal Palace early last season, would be prepared to work at Championship level. Potter, however, is the clear favourite."

For many decades in football’s development the end-of-season standings, triumphs and disappointments were pored over as sports results, not generally reckoned for their impact on clubs’ bank balances. Those days have dwindled as football’s revenues have swollen, as investors have bought clubs to make money for themselves, and as the financial gap between clubs and leagues has dramatically widened: cash has become a much more prominent consequence of winning and losing.For Premier League clubs a top-four finish is a landmark achievement to secure Champions League qualification – and the financial windfall it delivers. It is quite staggering to see that Leicester City made €82m (£70m) from Uefa TV payments last season for their run as reigning Premier League title holders to the Champions League quarter-finals.Due to Uefa’s agreed formula for allocating the riches, rewarding clubs for their progress and where they finished domestically the previous season, Leicester made almost double the €43m (£38m) Tottenham Hotspur made, still a very tidy bonus. Uefa starts new 2018-21 TV deals next season and has promised yet more money for the privileged top clubs, although the precise amounts are not yet divulged.The great financial divides distort and undermine competitiveness but there is no serious effort in football to distribute money more equally. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin is leading an examination of ways to alleviate the damage to “competitive balance” but has acknowledged that his room for change is practically limited. The real pressure is the other way, from rich clubs wanting more, as with the so-called “big six” Premier League clubs currently seeking a greater share of the league’s international TV rights, which have always been shared equally between all 20 clubs.In English football the enormous inequality is weirdly celebrated, the Championship play-off final hyped annually as football’s richest match, as if that is something the nation should be proud of. As play-offs are one-off matches, which can be decided like last year’s between Huddersfield and Reading on as narrow a margin as a shootout, the winner’s vast financial reward is clearly not in proportion to the achievement. The money simply encapsulates the divide between the Premier League and the Football League’s three divisions, from which First Division clubs broke away in 1992 so they could keep the lion’s share of new satellite TV money.The Premier League’s success, now garnering more from international TV rights, has meant the breakaway’s gap, despite the Football League’s attractions, best efforts and rebranding into the EFL, has stretched much wider. The Premier League clubs, and those relegated from it with lucrative parachute payments, are feasting on their record £8.4bn TV deal from 2016-19. Although UK income from Sky and BT Sport will fall from £5.13bn to £4.46bn during the 2019-22 deals because of BT Sport not bidding aggressively for the main packages, the Premier League executive chairman, Richard Scudamore, is confident that international growth will take it over the current £8.4bn total.The contrast with the EFL is alarming and puts Championship clubs under financial pressure as they strain to pay the players who might take them up. The EFL’s current TV deal amounts to £90m a year – 3% of the Premier League’s, shared among all 72 clubs. From 2019 a new five-year deal will pay £120m annually – improved, but still a fraction of Premier League riches.Parachute payments land the inequality into the Championship itself. The bottom three Premier League clubs last season, Hull City, Middlesbrough and Sunderland, made £97m, £99m and £93m respectively in 2016-17 from Premier League TV rights; parachute payments for relegated clubs are now £42m in the first season in the Championship, £34m in the second and £16.6m in the third, a huge financial advantage on other clubs. A club relegated after one season in the Premier League is paid two years of parachutes, not the third £16.6m, so the minimum windfall of promotion is £170m-£180m. Recognition of this divide did finally lead to the Premier League releasing a fraction of its money to the EFL directly in “solidarity” payments. They are not insignificant: £4.5m to each Championship club, £675,000 to those in League One, £450,000 for League Two clubs, but nowhere near enough to bridge the gap.A study into the effect of parachute payments by academics Rob Wilson, Girish Ramchandani and Daniel Plumley of Sheffield Hallam University documents the huge financial advantage they give clubs relegated from the Premier League and that they reduce competitiveness in the Championship.“The competitive balance of the [Championship] in general has declined in recent years,” they conclude. To address this, they suggest parachute payments should be shared throughout the EFL rather than paid only to relegated clubs, or a handicap system – or the abolition of parachute payments altogether.“[Their] premise in the early years was to soften the financial blow of relegation,” the report says, “but in light of increasing broadcasting fees all it appears to have done is to give relegated teams a significant advantage over their competitors.”The authors, though, recognise the Premier League’s power, leading to “powerful ‘super-clubs’ that monopolise the market to some extent”, means suggestions for greater equality are largely futile. The pressure is the other way: from big clubs, for inequality to be increased, in their favour."

Three hundred Liverpool shirts have been sent to the small Senegalese village of Bambali in the buildup to the Champions League final, donated by Sadio Mané, its most famous son. On Saturday he aims to deliver on a promise to spare his childhood friend the despair and disbelief that accompanied Liverpool’s triumph in Istanbul. The gift set will be complete when he brings a European Cup winner’s medal back home.“I remember AC Milan v Liverpool in 2005,” Mané explains. “Three-nil down, then 3-3 and penalties. This was a big memory for me. I was watching in my village, Bambali. I remember being with my friend, a big friend of mine, and at 3-0 down he was completely out of it. He stopped watching and ran like crazy to get away. Then he came back at the end and he could not believe it. Even to this day he cannot believe it. He came back after the game when Liverpool had won.”Mané dissolves into laughter at the 13-year-old memory, half his lifetime ago. The Liverpool forward laughed at his friend’s antics at the time – “I was not supporting Liverpool then, I was a Barcelona fan,” he admits – but thoughts of the club’s eighth European Cup final appearance stir pride. “If you had said then I would be playing the final I would say it is something incredible in my life,” he says. “Hopefully we are going to win.”Bambali, bedecked in red, will be united behind the Senegal forward against Real Madrid in Kiev. Their pride in Mané’s rise to global stardom is not lost on the 26-year‑old, who remains in regular contact with family and friends back home, including the one who missed the comeback that secured Liverpool’s last Champions League triumph. “I spoke to him yesterday,” Mané says. “He is a big Liverpool fan. He is still in Senegal. His name is Youssouph Diatta. He asked me that this time do not be 3-0 down.“Nobody in the village will work this day. My family still live in the village. My mum and my uncle. They are all going to be watching. There are 2,000 in the village. I bought 300 Liverpool jerseys to send to the people in the village so the fans can wear them to watch the final. I will be going back in the summer after the World Cup and hopefully I will be showing everyone a winner’s medal.”Istanbul staged the most famous rapid-fire Liverpool performance of all, with three goals in six second‑half minutes stunning Milan en route to the club’s fifth European Cup. But devastating bursts of firepower have been such a feature of Liverpool’s Champions League campaign under Jürgen Klopp that not even a Real team pushing for a hat-trick of titles provoke fear.Liverpool scored three goals in 12 minutes in the play-off against Hoffenheim, three goals in 16 minutes and two in another five‑minute spell against Maribor, two in nine at Sevilla and three in 15 minutes plus two in four against Spartak Moscow at Anfield. And that was just the group stage. Porto, Manchester City and Roma were all in effect banished from the knockout phase before they could identify the threat and regroup.“It would be good for football [if Liverpool won] because of how we play,” Mané says. “I cannot say most of the world wants that because Real Madrid fans will say otherwise. Maybe everyone who is not a Real Madrid, Everton, Man Utd and Man City fan. I think everyone else would like to see Liverpool win the trophy. Real Madrid won it two times and want a third time in a row. We respect them as a great team and great club in history but Liverpool also has history. It won’t be easy but we will do our best.”He adds: “I am just thinking it is incredible to be in the final, not about pressure. I’m just happy and excited. It is the best time for the whole squad to play.“We are in the best shape; there is no tiredness. This kind of game does not happen all the time and it is one of the most important of a career. It will not be easy. They have experience and are one of the best teams in the world, but we have quality and can beat any team in the world.”Liverpool are leading scorers in this season’s Champions League with 40 goals (excluding six against Hoffenheim in the play‑off). Mané, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah are responsible for 29 of them. It is a record that invites comparisons between Liverpool’s fearsome front three and the prodigious Real attack of Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, albeit not from Mané himself.“You can write this, I didn’t say it,” he adds. “We are happy people name us at this level. Thank you for the compliment. It is something we have been working hard on to play in this Champions League. I am always honoured to play alongside these great players. People talk about the front three but it is the whole team that makes us better. They did a great job behind to help us score goals. It makes us happy.” A feeling no doubt shared in Bambali."

“During the transfer window and even the month after it was a little difficult to live with the situation,” Fabinho admitted in December. “I had to leave, I did not leave, etc. But I do not think about it any more, the page is turned.”A little more than six months later and the boy who left his home near São Paulo for the bright lights of Rio as a teenager has finally been granted his wish. Yet while his wife, Rebeca Tavares, could barely contain her excitement as she filmed their flight on a private jet from Madrid to Merseyside on Monday in a video posted later on Instagram, Fabinho managed to keep his cool as he responded to her impromptu interview.“We’re landing in Liverpool in a few minutes. How do you feel?” he was asked. “What?” came the response. “How do you feel about Liverpool?” pressed his wife. “I feel good. Thanks.”Monaco supporters will be used to such understatement from a player who prefers to do his talking on the pitch. Ever since Fabinho arrived in the principality as a fresh-faced 19-year-old, his conduct and attitude have been exemplary. Initially signed on a year-long loan from the Portuguese club Rio Ave having spent a season in Real Madrid’s Castilla side, he became a regular at right-back under Claudio Ranieri in Monaco’s first season back in Ligue 1 and was retained for another year when Leonardo Jardim took over as manager the following year.But it was Jardim’s decision to switch Fabinho to a central midfield role in his third season at the club that transformed both his and Monaco’s fortunes. Having signed a permanent deal with the club that summer, the Portuguese immediately installed the 6ft 2in Brazilian at the heart of his exciting young team and reaped the rewards.Securing the Ligue 1 title ahead of Paris Saint-Germain’s expensively assembled squad in 2016-17 and reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League during the same season was the culmination of that journey. Yet while Kylian Mbappé, Bernardo Silva, Tiémoué Bakayoko and Benjamin Mendy were all allowed to move on at the end of the campaign, it was telling that Fabinho was ordered to remain despite an informal agreement with his representatives, Jorge Mendes and the former Portugal midfielder Deco.The result was a mediocre start to the season that may have ultimately cost him a place in Brazil’s World Cup squad, although the player who left Fluminense having never featured for the first team has since underlined his undoubted ability as Monaco secured Champions League qualification for a fourth successive year.Manchester United initially appeared to be the most likely destination for Fabinho once Monaco decided to allow the 24-year-old to finally depart but despite holding talks last summer, and José Mourinho sharing the same agent, an offer did not materialise. In fact Atlético Madrid were the only club to have made a firm bid, of around £30m, until Liverpool’s offer blew them out of the water.Liverpool’s relationship with Mendes, who arranged Fabinho’s move to Rio Ave in 2013, proved pivotal in the club’s latest intelligent move in the transfer market. Having already secured their record purchase of Naby Keïta from RB Leipzig last summer, the two new recruits will report at Melwood on 1 July as part of a squad that already looks considerably stronger than the party which lost to Real Madrid in the Champions League final.The addition of a high‑class holding player to complement the abilities of Keita, a Guinea international, Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain, Georginio Wijnaldum and Jordan Henderson in midfield will provide more defensive stability for a sustained challenge for the Premier League title. But it was the influence of another of Jürgen Klopp’s current squad that persuaded Fabinho to take the plunge.“I spoke on the phone with [the Liverpool forward Roberto] Firmino,” he told the French broadcaster RMC. “I know him personally ... I was able to speak with the manager and people who work at the club. They gave me a lot of confidence.“I always said that this was a league that I wanted to get to know, where I wanted to play. You see lots of passion, crazy atmospheres in all the stadiums each weekend. I cannot wait to experience that.”Fabinho could soon be joined by Nabil Fekir, with Liverpool understood to be in advanced discussions to sign the France forward from Lyon for around £60m. Even with the heartache of Saturday night in Kiev still fresh in the memory, Liverpool supporters will be already counting down the days to the start of next season."

Carlos Carvalhal is set to lose his job as Swansea City manager in the wake of relegation, with the club ready to cut him loose after their final Premier League match against Stoke City on Sunday. The 52-year-old’s contract expires at the end of the season and there is an option in the club’s favour that would enable them to keep him on, yet the way Swansea imploded in the final two months of the season has convinced the board that the Portuguese is not the right man for the job.Although Carvalhal was appointed in December with half an eye on the Championship, where he led Sheffield Wednesday to the play-offs in successive seasons, the faith in his ability to manage Swansea in the longer term and mount a genuine promotion challenge has been eroded on the back of the disastrous run of form that saw the Welsh club sucked back into the bottom three in the last week of the campaign and all but relegated as a result of Huddersfield’s draw at Chelsea on Wednesday night.Swansea have failed to win any of their last nine matches in all competitions, in effect waved a white flag in their FA Cup quarter-final against Tottenham, and picked up only three points after beating West Ham 4-1 at the start of March, when they climbed to 13th in the table and seemed to be heading towards survival.The turnaround up until that point had been spectacular – Carvalhal took 17 points from his first nine games in charge to breathe new life into a club that appeared doomed when he took over. Yet all momentum was lost during a run-in that saw Carvalhal adopt an increasingly cautious and negative approach, with Swansea scoring only twice in their last eight matches as he persevered with playing five at the back.Swansea’s problems, however, extend way beyond the manager. They flirted with relegation in the previous two seasons and fundamental problems at the club have not been addressed since Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, Swansea’s majority shareholders, took control a little under two years ago.Swansea’s player recruitment since the Americans’ takeover has been dreadful and radical changes are needed in that department in the summer, raising questions about what role, if any, Huw Jenkins, the chairman, will have at the club in the future. Jenkins had previously suggested that he will review his position at the end of the season regardless of whether Swansea survived.The club’s search for a new manager – their fifth in the space of 19 chaotic months – will take them in the direction of a young, ambitious and upcoming coach, more in line with the sort of appointment that was made during their rise through the leagues, when Roberto Martínez and Brendan Rodgers enjoyed such success with a clear playing philosophy. It is, in effect, time to start all over again."

This World Cup everybody’s talking about. What is it, exactly?The Fifa World Cup is an international football tournament contested by 32 nations every four years. This year’s competition kicks off on 14 June, when hosts Russia play Saudi Arabia in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium. After a total of 64 matches played in 12 venues across 11 different Russian cities, the champions will be crowned in the same arena on 15 July. It is, without question, the biggest, most prestigious sporting event on the planet.OK, so who organises it and for how long has it been “a thing”?Fifa stands for the Féderation Internationale de Football Association and their third president Jules Rimet was the innovator behind the first World Cup, an invitational tournament contested by just 13 teams that was staged and won by Uruguay in 1930. This year’s tournament will be the 21st.With just 32 teams taking part, an awful lot of nations must miss out. That hardly seems fair.With the exception of Russia, who qualify automatically as hosts, the other 31 teams all had to go through a rigorous two-year qualifying process to make it this far. Fifa has 211 national association affiliates spread across six different confederations around the globe.Did any traditionally “big” countries not make it?England were the only “home nation” to qualify, while Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland all failed with varying degrees of predictability. The USA, the Netherlands, South American champions Chile, Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon and the four-times World Cup winners Italy are among the most high profile nations to miss out on qualification for Russia 2018. For many international powerhouses, qualifying is invariably little more than a formality. For others it is an incredible achievement.Others? What others?Iceland will contest their first World Cup finals this summer and with a population of just 335,000 are the smallest country to qualify in the history of the competition.How will a winner be decided from those who did make the cut?The 32 countries have already been drawn into eight groups of four teams which will be decided on a round robin basis. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stages, which is when things start to get really tense.What happens if any of these knockout matches end in a draw?If the sides are level after 90 minutes, they play an additional 30 minutes of extra time.And if they’re still level?The outcome is decided by a penalty shoot-out. There have been 26 in World Cup finals history and both Brazil (1994) and Italy (2006) have actually won finals by this very stressful method.Who is expected to win this year’s tournament?It’s a tough one to call. Germany are the holders and are expected to be in the shake-up again, while Brazil, France, Spain and Argentina are other former winners who many expect to do well.Have England ever won the World Cup?Once, in 1966 and they’re still dining out on it over 50 years later.Tell me more ...As tournament hosts, they beat Germany 4-2 in the final at Wembley Stadium to win the Jules Rimet Trophy.The what now?The Jules Rimet Trophy. It was originally called Victory but later renamed in honour of the Fifa president who dreamt up the World Cup. Brazil got to keep it after winning it for the third time in 1970, but it was stolen 13 years later and has never been returned.So what do the winners get now?Acclaim, medals, hero status in their homeland and a hefty financial bonus from their national Football Association. They also get presented with the Fifa World Cup trophy, which is just shy of 37 centimetres in height and weighs 6.1 kilograms. Made of 18 carat gold with a malachite base, it depicts two human figures holding up the earth. It is arguably the most iconic trophy in all of sport.Such a popular event must generate a lot of cash. Who gets it all?Fifa get most of it. They sold the TV rights for the last World Cup for $2.48bn and made a further $2.34bn from marketing and licensing rights. Only about 10% of the revenue it generated came from actual ticket sales.Anything else I should know?This year’s tournament will be the first World Cup in which Video Assistant Referees (VAR) will be used to help referees avoid making potentially match-deciding mistakes when it comes to such important issues as awarding goals, penalties or doling out red cards. It will also referees avoid cases of mistaken identity, as has been known to happen from time to time.Sounds like a good idea ...It certainly does in theory, but many are predicting disaster once it’s put into practice. VAR has been tested in a number of tournaments around the world, often with hilarious consequences and a number of referees will arrive in Russia with no prior experience of using it. While Fifa are confident it will be a success, many doom-mongers are predicting that VAR could become the main, unwelcome talking point of Russia 2018.If I want to sound knowledgable in front of people who know more about the World Cup than I do, what should I say?“It’s strange that nobody is mentioning Uruguay as likely winners even though they finished ahead of Argentina in their qualifying group.”If I want to sound knowledgable in front of people who know more about the World Cup than I do, what should I not say?“It’s strange that nobody is mentioning England as likely winners even though they finished ahead of Scotland in their qualifying group.”"

Maxime Biamou was the hero as Coventry booked their place in the League Two play-off final after a 4-1 win at Notts County that left the home side’s manager, Kevin Nolan, raging over key decisions.Biamou scored once in each half – the first goal from a spectacular overhead kick after six minutes – to confirm Coventry will face Exeter at Wembley following their 5-2 aggregate win.Marc McNulty doubled the visitors’ lead with his 28th goal of the season in the 37th minute before Jorge Grant pulled a goal back for County.Biamou’s second, after County’s Jonathan Forte had a goal controversially disallowed for offside, and a late Tom Bayliss goal extended their advantage.It was McNulty’s controversial late penalty in the first leg that meant the match at the Ricoh Arena ended 1-1 and Coventry brought that momentum straight into Friday’s game.Forte was convinced he had levelled when he put the ball into the back of the net only for the assistant referee’s flag to deny him.Coventry took full advantage of the disallowed goal as Biamou found time in the area to turn and fire a low shot into the bottom corner, despite County’s appeals for offside.Nolan said: “I am gutted. I feel aggrieved because three of the decisions over the two legs have cost us. We had momentum and when Forte scores, he is onside by a yard.“I don’t know how he has put his flag up but he has and it’s cost us again. It’s upsetting and they’ve cost us a chance to get to Wembley.“Coventry came here and played well, but we more than matched them. We had them on the ropes in the second half and if the goal stands then we are in.“And if they had not given the penalty last week then we are still a goal up. It’s just all ifs and buts, but they can’t get decisions like that wrong.“I’ve been crying out for professional referees and the linesman wasn’t keeping up. They’ve dropped two clangers. They got it completely wrong.”"
football,"The former Crystal Palace prodigy, now playing in Turkey, tells how surviving a horrific crash gave him a broader perspective on his life and career

Sun 20 May 2018 15.04 BST


First published on Sun 20 May 2018 15.00 BST

Footballers enjoy privileges that few can aspire to but for John Bostock the simple pleasure of being alive is enough. Last year when travelling back home in England following a game for his French team Lens, the former Crystal Palace midfielder suffered a head-on crash while driving down the motorway at 3am. The other driver was drunk and going the wrong way at 70mph, resulting in his passenger dying and Bostock’s car being a crumpled heap, but he was miraculously unhurt.“Scientifically, I probably shouldn’t have survived that crash. Two cars hitting each other head-on at 70mph, it made me appreciate life, appreciate family and appreciate the gift that we have to live every day,” Bostock says as we sit in the dugout at his new club, Bursaspor. “It was a big wake-up call, something that there isn’t a plan to get over. You just have to focus on the future and take every day as it comes, appreciate life for what it is. I am grateful that I went through it because you see life in a different way when you’re that close to death.”Bostock expected the damage to be worse but his strong Christian faith ensured he recovered from an incident which could have been far worse. “It is only by the grace of God I survived that crash. It is something you never want to be involved in but a huge wake-up call to life. As footballers we focus on football, your career and your own life but when something like that happens it makes you realise about life in general. My family were really shaken to find out someone lost their life in the crash, which was devastating. I came out without a graze, thankfully. Psychologically it took a bit to get over but I was back playing in 10 days.“When you are involved in something like that, you are always thinking ‘What if? What if?’ and sometimes you get flashbacks. I couldn’t sleep for a night, it has a big affect on your family but it also made me realise I have a destiny to achieve; I am here for a reason.”The tumultuous nature of football is something he can take in his stride after the disappointment of being tipped as a future England captain in his teens. Now that he is 26 and has survived a major car crash the prospect of switching continents at the end of the winter transfer window was not something to be feared. Last season he won the Ligue 2 player of the season award but it took until the 2009-10 Turkish Super Lig champions Bursaspor approached him on the penultimate day of January for him to move on to bigger things.“It just came last minute but I spoke to the coach, I was ready for a change. I really wanted to play first division in a good league in Europe and I had several offers but I spoke to the coach here, Paul Le Guen, who in France is a legend. My friend Will Ekong is here and told me all about Bursa and the club, the supporters and the size of the club. We spoke, I considered it with my wife and my family, it was a quick decision but one we made and really believed it was in my best interests to sign and so far I am happy with my choice.”From the relative tranquillity of Ligue 2, Bostock was thrust into a home debut against the Turkish giants Besiktas. It was a baptism of fire as the Englishman discovered the atmosphere he could expect at his new home ground, which is shaped like a crocodile in honour of the club’s nickname. “One of the things you realise very quickly is that it’s a cauldron of football. If you can play here in front of the fans and with the pressure then you can play anywhere. You see videos of how passionate the fans are. In my debut against Besiktas you couldn’t hear anything on the pitch, you couldn’t hear your team-mates, you couldn’t hear yourself think but that’s just the way of the fans, as they give you everything but they want something back.”This interview takes place on a day the club’s players have refused to train having not been paid for five months, meaning Bostock had not received a penny in wages since his January arrival. Despite the financial issues, the midfielder is adamant he has made the right decision for his well-travelled career. “I’ve played in MLS, I’ve played in Belgium and France but here it’s completely different. I thought I’d seen everything in football but I’ve come here, seen a little bit more but honestly it’s an amazing place to play. The standard is terrific, I am playing against world class players almost every week, internationals in every club.”After helping OH Leuven to promotion in Belgium and being named the best footballer in Ligue 2, Bostock has attracted suitors once again in England where he is still thought of as the kid at Palace who then never made the grade at Tottenham. But now older and more mature, he does not fear returning to England to show what he has become.“People may feel like if I came back to England I may need to prove something but I am not worried. Maybe a few years ago I would feel worried and that I would need to prove myself, that I was this wonderkid but I don’t need to prove any of that any more. If I came back I would just want to do the best job I could for the club I play for and enjoy playing in England in front of my friends and family in the most watched league in the world.”After helping ensure Bursaspor’s top-flight status for another season, Bostock is continuing to look forward as he never wants to dwell on the past, whether it be in football or his horrific car crash. “I want to be remembered as somebody who fulfilled the purpose they were created for. Sometimes if you start comparing yourself to others, you start chasing other people’s destinies and purposes. I believe I was made for a purpose. I am who I am and I’ve been on my own journey, it’s formed me to be the man I am today, my character, the way I play, it’s not been easy, so I want to be remembered as someone who never gave up and pushed to fulfil his potential.”When Bostock left Spurs with nowhere to go, he was worried his football career would be taken away from him but he came close to suffering the greatest loss, so he is rightly content proving himself right and others wrong from afar."
football,"Marseille had to beat Atlético Madrid in the Europa League final or finish third in Ligue 1 to qualify for the Champions League. They did neither but should still be proud of their seasonBy Adam White and Eric Devin for Get French Football NewsAdam White and Eric Devin

Mon 21 May 2018 13.31 BST

Marseille’s longest-serving player, Steve Mandanda, started the week by winning his record-breaking fifth goalkeeper of the year award in France. His team-mate, Florian Thauvin, was shortlisted for the player of the year award after scoring 22 goals in Ligue 1 and Luiz Gustavo also capped a fine individual season by featuring in the team of the year. Marseille have made immense progress this season, competing on two fronts despite their severely limited squad, but any mood of jubilation around the club last weekend has been battered by their failure to qualify for the Champions League twice in four days.Their defeat to Atlético Madrid in the Europa League final on Wednesday felt inevitable. The Spanish side have more resources, more resolve and a coach with more acumen in the form of Diego Simeone. Marseille looked bright in the early stages but, when a big chance came Valère Germain’s way he snatched at it, something you cannot do against such parsimonious opponents. Things went from bad to worse for Marseille when Dimitri Payet suffered a recurrence of a hamstring injury that had cast a doubt on his fitness before the final. Payet’s resilience and good recent form had put him in the running to feature in Didier Deschamps’ squad for the World Cup, so he was understandably distraught as he left the pitch.The former West Ham player was devastated for himself – he has only played in one major tournament since making his international debut eight years ago – but also for his club. After the match he defended his decision to play in the final and proudly declared his love for the club, saying: “Marseille is in my heart and if it is necessary to do it again tomorrow, after tomorrow, in six months, in one year, I would do it without question. I repeat, I love this club and I am ready to make sacrifices for it. I was fully aware of the risks I was taking and I fully assume the consequences.”While Payet’s attitude is laudable, it could have harmed Marseille on Saturday in their final league match of the season. Going into the weekend, Marseille still had a chance of qualifying for the Champions League, especially because their rivals faced more motivated opposition. Marseille were up against Amiens, who had already secured safety, while Monaco had to travel to relegation-threatened Troyes and Lyon were playing Europa League-chasing Nice.Marseille, with Morgan Sanson filling in for Payet at No10, quickly took a 2-0 lead, but Amiens made things a bit nervier than the hosts would have liked. Moussa Konaté did well to pull a goal back for Amiens the half hour and their goalkeeper, Regis Gurtner, kept an exhausted Marseille team at bay. Eventually Marseille held on for the 2-1 win, but their efforts came to nothing; Monaco won 3-0 at Troyes and Lyon beat Nice 3-2 in a thrilling encounter at the Parc OL, meaning Marseille finished fourth and had to settle for a place in the Europa League.Heartbreak, then, was the theme of a week that had begun with Marseille’s players being honoured. Once the disappointment has subsided, the club should look back and take heart from a strong season. They need more depth at centre-back and a top-class striker, but none of their first-choice XI have been linked away from the club and, under Rudi Garcia, they have shown a new willingness to go toe-to-toe with the best Ligue 1 has to offer. The results have not always been pretty – they have earned just two points in their six matches against the top three – but this team are willing and able to play a direct, attacking style of football.A place in the Champions League would – and perhaps should – have been their reward this season but, rather than focusing on the pain of the last week, their fans should be pleased their side is talented, stable and ready to move forward in a summer in which Monaco and Lyon could once again be picked clean in the transfer window. Marseille are perhaps even favourites to come second in Ligue 1 next year. If this side can demonstrate the conviction shown in Payet’s words, they will experience a lot less of the anguish they have felt in the past week.• While Ligue 1 has long been a breeding ground for young talent, this season has shown that French football can also help develop more established names. Wayward spells in England had seen the stock of Mario Balotelli and Memphis Depay plummet but both are turning heads once more. Depay scored a stunning hat-trick for Lyon on Saturday as they beat Nice 3-2 to secure their place in the Champions League next season. His sly free-kick that slipped under the wall and his cute, dinked finish over the keeper were the highlights in another evanescent display. Depay’s end-of-season form has marked a gear shift from flashy self-indulgence to talismanic leadership. He is back on course to become the superstar he once threatened to be. Balotelli has found a home in France and a mooted move to Marseille could be a defining moment for both club and player. Whatever their futures hold, their goal tallies in Ligue 1 this season – 19 for Depay and 18 for Balotelli – are hard to argue with.• Although PSG had secured the title some time ago, they still had a part to play a hectic final day in Ligue 1. Caen secured a point at home to the champions, which was enough to keep them above Toulouse, who beat mid-table Guingamp 2-1 to finish 18th. They will now face second division AC Ajaccio over two legs for the last remaining place in next season’s Ligue 1. Toulouse’s victory condemned Troyes to 19th and relegation. Nice started the day in sixth, the final Europa League spot, but their defeat at Lyon meant both Bordeaux and St Étienne could usurp them with a win of their own. Bordeaux’s 4-0 routing of bottom side Metz was enough to pip St Étienne – who beat Lille 5-0 – on goal difference, and join Rennes and Marseille in the Europa League.Caen 0-0 PSGTroyes 0-3 MonacoLyon 3-2 NiceMarseille 2-1 AmiensRennes 1-1 MontpellierMetz 0-4 BordeauxSt Étienne 5-0 LilleNantes 1-0 StrasbourgDijon 2-1 AngersToulouse 2-1 Guingamp"

When Lucy Bronze moved from Manchester City to the European champions, Lyon, last summer she said she wanted to win the Champions League. Fittingly the England defender’s goal separated her new and former clubs in April’s semi-final. On Thursday Bronze hopes to complete the job against Wolfsburg.“It was kind of written in the stars that it had to be me that scored the winning goal,” Bronze said as she prepared for the final here. “I think we could have had a few more but obviously I’m happy we won the game. We’re in the final and that’s why I came to Lyon.”Bronze was this week named as the BBC women’s footballer of the year, the first defender and first England player to win the award, but her move to the four-times Champions League winners took some getting used to. “At first it was a little bit intimidating meeting everyone. Everyone is a world-class player, in every single position, and I was scared to give the ball away – I still am now,” she laughs. “I’m scared to make a bad pass or put in a bad cross, but it’s good, though. It’s pushing me. The reason I came to Lyon was to play with these players. I knew they could make me better because they are at such a good level.”There is a reason Bronze has gone from being considered the world’s best right-back to the world’s best defender, yet she is modest about her ability compared with that of her team-mates: “Some of them have a ridiculous amount of football talent. I don’t think I’ll ever hit their level but I’ve learnt a lot from them and they’ve helped improve the parts of my game I came here to improve.“I’ve fed off them and they’ve fed off me. I’m really athletic and they appreciate that a bit more; it’s been really good for all.”Bronze has also found the different style of coaching in France has challenged her. “In England it’s very tactical. When I think about my time at Man City or with England, you go through so much detail.“ That can be really good but sometimes you lose your fluidity and spontaneity. France is completely different. You don’t really have a lot of detail.“I don’t know if that’s because we’ve got all the best players so everyone kind of knows what they should be doing, but it’s all about playing with each other and working off each other.“The coach just keeps telling us to play, play and move, pass and move, play off each other, work off each and that’s completely at the other end of the spectrum to what I’m used to. Maybe somewhere in between would be good, but it’s great that I get the balance of a lot of coaching with England when I’m with the national team and when I’m at Lyon I’m working on being a bit more impulsive.”Lyon have secured the league title and, if they win the Champions League and their Coupe de France final against their nearest rivals Paris St-Germain, they will complete a second successive treble.Wolfsburg are hoping for a treble of their own. Bronze sees Wolfsburg’s attacking play as the greatest threat. “They’ve got world-class players all over the pitch but Pernille Harder is their key player. She’s an attacking player, she links everything up, she creates goals, she scores goals.“You look at the number of goals Wolfsburg scored against Chelsea [five in their two-legged semi-final] and you’ve got to say their attack is doing their job and is their biggest threat.”Bronze, though, is unconcerned. “Every single day we have to train against the best forwards in the world: [Eugénie] Le Sommer, [Camille] Abily, [Dzsenifer] Marozsán. So I like to think whoever we face isn’t going to be much better or too different from what we face in training every day and that we’re well prepared to combat anything Wolfsburg have to offer.”Unusually the final will come with less pressure for Bronze than the semi-final against City. “The first leg was a strange moment – going back to my old team and playing such a big game, having stated the reason I came to Lyon was for the Champions League. I felt more pressure in that game than I’ve felt in any game in my life.”Wolfsburg had to go through extra time and penalties against Bayern Munich to lift the DFB Pokal, not ideal preparation. Although Lyon dropped their first points of the season when drawing 0-0 with PSG last Friday, Bronze thinks that was the perfect preparation. “We dominated the game and had all the chances – I think they maybe had one or two chances in the second half.“We know that nine times out of 10 we win that game. It’s not the end of the world and it’s good preparation and motivation for the final. We’ve basically just played a replay of last year’s Champions League final – there’s no better preparation. We drew, so we know now we need to be a bit better and not be complacent.”"

Welcome to theguardian.com review of the 2017-18 Premier League season. We have nominated some contenders for this category but this is just to get the discussion going: offer your suggestions below the line …Now there can be no doubt: Salah is the most entertaining Egyptian to arrive in English football since Mohamed Al Fayed. Once a Chelsea cast-off, he needed one campaign to become a Liverpool icon and race within sight of the planet’s Untouchable Duo, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. On his debut against Watford he won a penalty for Roberto Firmino and later helped himself to a goal; that was pretty much how the rest of his campaign panned out as he wreaked havoc on opponents across the land. Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool proved to be the perfect environment and he proved to be the perfect recruit for them, a snip at £34m. He has been thrilling to watch, somehow allying breakneck speed and sneaky feet with cold-blooded, even witty, decision-making. He made something happen nearly every time he got the ball. Usually a goal. And what a variety of goals! Slaloming between two defenders before curling the ball into the top corner against Everton; sending Ben Davies sliding in the wrong direction before bewitching Jan Vertonghen and scoring against Spurs from a tight angle; lobbing Ederson from 30 yards against Manchester City; sprinting for 60 yards to plant the ball past Petr Cech against Arsenal; blasting a volley past Jack Butland; looping a header over Asmir Begovic. Nearly everyone who faced Salah suffered. And everyone who watched him left satisfied.While Salah has approached comparability to Ronaldo and Messi, Manchester City’s wondrous playmaker can be ranked alongside Pythagoras and Euclid – or maybe above them, for De Bruyne is some class of geometrician-magician, wowing with the precise lines and arcs he traces with any part of his foot from any place on the pitch. The boxer Joe Louis used to warn his opponents “you can run, but you can’t hide” but De Bruyne puts a positive spin on this, sometimes literally, effectively telling his team-mates “you can run, and I will find you”. There is a beautiful efficiency in his improbable passing, and an ice-cold rage that appears to drive him. When he shoots it seems like he means to settle an argument for ever. There was certainly no way Chelsea were going to find a comeback to his peremptory strike on his return to Stamford Bridge in September. He’s brilliant. End of.When Luke Shaw played well it was because he used José Mourinho’s brain, said Manchester United’s manager on one famous occasion. If that is true, then when Mourinho masterminded another clean sheet for United, it was usually because of De Gea’s hands. The goalkeeper was United’s most influential performer again this season, continually producing saves that defied reasonable expectation and gave an illusion of solidity to the rest of United’s backline.England’s best player had an outstanding campaign, scoring and creating prolifically, terrorising defences and really annoying people who continue to claim there’s a good reason to badmouth him. Sure, he’s not flawless – his finishing has improved dramatically but he’s still guilty of surprising misses but, then again, so is Salah – but overall he is an exhilarating player to watch and a tireless, conscientious, gifted and consistently effective team player. If Manchester City toyed with the notion of selling him last summer, they’ve surely thrown that idea in the bin, which is where some other thoughts about Sterling belong.The top five clubs do not have all the exciting talent. There are some delightful players at lesser sides: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, for instance, looked lethal after his arrival at Arsenal; Riyad Mahrez was often a joy to watch despite the frustration of his thwarted move to Manchester City and Leicester’s sagging; Xherdan Shaqiri did some fine things at Stoke; Christopher Schindler was quietly classy at Huddersfield; but perhaps none of them were as consistently dangerous, eye-catching and influential as Zaha, who triggered panic and glee nearly every time he ran with the ball. “I was reading the programme before the match and there was a statistic that claimed Zaha had only two assists so far this season,” said Roy Hodgson after Crystal Palace’s 3-0 win at Leicester in December. “But as far as I can make out Wilf is involved in at least 80% of what we create.”"

The inevitable stampede for the West Brom exit door looks likely to be led by Jonny Evans, who is reported to be the subject of interest from managerless Arsenal. A relegation release clause in the Northern Ireland international’s contract means he is available for just £3m. Both Arsenal and Manchester City are ready to revive the interest they showed in the 30-year-old last summer, and again in the January transfer window. With gaffe-prone central defender Skhodran Mustafi likely to be shown the door and Laurent Koscielny ruled out with an achilles injury for the foreseeable future, Arsenal are also being linked with a couple of other stoppers – specifically Sokratis Papastathopoulos from Borussia Dortmund and Caglar Soyuncu from Freiburg.Evans’s former Manchester United team-mate, Wayne Rooney, is not in quite as big demand, but reports this morning suggest the Everton striker will dither over his mooted move to DC United now that Sam Allardyce has been relieved of his managerial duties at Goodison Park. Rooney wants to see who’ll replace Allardyce before making any concrete plans and may also have been stung by the negative reaction of many DC United fans to news of his possible arrival in the American capital. “It has come to me through a few people that there is some positive and negative spins to the whole thing,” said DC United coach Ben Olsen. “I don’t really give a hoot what the media has right now. It’s their job to live in this hyperbole world.”Meanwhile in the Rumour Mill’s more mundane world, former Hull City and Watford boss, Marco Silva, is once again being courted by Everton, while West Ham can’t seem to make up their minds whether they want Silva, Hebei China Fortune’s Manuel Pellegrini, Shakhtar Donetsk manager Paulo Fonseca or his Newcastle United counterpart Rafael Benítez to be their next manager. All three men have been mentioned as possible successors to David Moyes, but rumours abound that Fonseca has already turned down the job.Fresh from helping Atlético Madrid to the most straightforward of Europa League wins over Marseille last night, Sime Vrsaljko will wake up to find himself the subject of interest from Manchester United. The 26-year-old right-back is available for £30m and Antonio Valencia isn’t getting any younger. In the market for a left-back, Atlético had been monitoring the progress of Kieran Tierney, but the 20-year-old Celtic star, who will line up in Saturday’s Scottish Cup final against Motherwell, doesn’t seem in any rush to leave the club he has been with since the age of seven. “I’ve never thought about being away from Celtic,” he said. “Maybe one day it will happen. It’s kind of a confidence-booster in a way to know you’ve put the hard work in and massive teams all over Europe are noticing it.” Wolves are preparing for life in the Premier League by hitching their skirts at AC Milan striker André Silva, but will have to fend off competition from Monaco. Should Silva end up at Molineux, he won’t be the first client of super-agent and Wolves advisor Jorge Mendes to have done so in recent times. Porto right-back Ricardo Pereira is wanted by Leicester City, who will have to stump up the thick end of £25m to secure his services. "

Manchester United are considering marking their final Premier League match, at home to Watford on Sunday, with a gesture of support for Sir Alex Ferguson.United confirmed on Wednesday night that Ferguson “no longer needs intensive care” as their former manager recuperates after a brain haemorrhage.Ferguson underwent an operation on Saturday at Salford Royal Hospital and remains there, having collapsed at his home in Wilmslow that morning.The positive bulletin on Ferguson’s condition has increased the likelihood that the club will make a public show of support on Sunday.Also on Wednesday José Mourinho offered encouragement regarding the 76-year-old’s health. “We are very, very positive,” he said. “We are confident.”Mourinho’s team are at West Ham United on Thursday night. Asked how Ferguson’s condition might affect the display, the manager said: “I can only think that if there is any relation it is a positive relation.”Ferguson ended his 26-and-a-half-year tenure at United in May 2013 as British football’s most successful manager, claiming the last of his 13 Premier League titles that season."
football,"Stanislav Cherchesov applied a new broom when taking over following failure at Euro 2016 but injuries and fall-outs mean uncertainty remains over Russia’s best XIGosha Chernov

This article is part of the Guardian’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.Stanislav Cherchesov took charge of Russia immediately after a disastrous Euro 2016 campaign in which the team – led by Leonid Slutsky – finished last in their group. Shortly after his appointment Cherchesov announced his intention to build a side from scratch. Firstly he switched formation to a back three and began looking for the right combination of defenders. It was a case of shedding the past while moving with the times. “We have not achieved anything with four at the back,” he said when explaining his decision. “Moreover, almost half of Russian Premier League teams are playing with three defenders. So we want to be flexible.”It was clear that Igor Akinfeev would keep his long-standing spot in goal, but the defence remained up in the air. Three veterans – the Berezutsky twins Vasili and Alexey, and Sergey Ignashevich – effectively retired from international football in 2016 so Cherchesov started to use inexperienced and young defenders such as Fyodor Kudryashov, Ilya Kutepov, Georgy Dzhikiya and Viktor Vasin. Those players aside, Cherchesov ended up using 10 players at centre-back in almost two years.It means no one, perhaps not even even Cherchesov himself, can accurately predict the three that will start this summer, although injuries to Vasin and Dzhikiya have added to the uncertainty. Both would probably be expecting to face Saudi Arabia in the opener had they not torn their cruciate ligaments earlier in the year. Ignashevich in fact made a dramatic return to the provisional squad on 14 May after Ruslan Kambolov’s withdrawal although it would be quite a turnaround if he played in June.Russia’s luck with injuries has been abysmal. Another key man who will miss the competition after cruciate surgery is the forward Alexander Kokorin. He was brilliant in the first half of the season, scoring 19 goals for Zenit St Petersburg, but now Cherchesov must source firepower from elsewhere. Kokorin’s backup at Zenit, Anton Zabolotny, was in awful form this spring and Artyom Dzyuba – who has had an eventful loan from Zenit to Arsenal Tula – is rumoured to have fallen out with Cherchesov, which means the first choice up front will be Fyodor Smolov, the prolific FC Krasnodar striker.Midfield is another unpredictable area. Russia will certainly use two wing-backs but those spots remain up for grabs. More centrally, Russia’s big problem is the lack of a strong holding midfielder. There should be an obvious solution in Igor Denisov of the Lokomotiv Moscow, but back in 2015, when they both worked at Dynamo Moscow, Cherchesov and Denisov fell out and have not spoken to each other since. Denisov is the best defensive midfielder in Russia by a mile, but Cherchesov has never called him up.Instead Cherchesov has tended to use Denis Glushakov of Spartak as a holding midfielder. Glushakov has had a poor season though, and is not a specialist in that role anyway; he has been named only among the reserves in Cherchesov’s squad, which sets up another poser. Russia do at least have a number of good box-to-box midfielders; Cherchesov has confidence in Alexander Golovin, Roman Zobnin, Daler Kuzyaev and Alan Dzagoev, who are likely to compete for the three central berths. Finally, the gifted Alexey Miranchuk should start behind Smolov. With Kokorin injured, Russia will field one striker and one attacking midfielder.Probable starting XIWhich player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup? Golovin is the youngest player in the team and one of three whose places in the starting XI are nailed-on (along with Akinfeev and Smolov), having become a key man at the heart of Russia’s midfield. No wonder there have been strong rumours about a possible move to Premier League clubs, including Chelsea and Arsenal.Which player is likely to disappoint?Since Kokorin tore his ligaments, Smolov has become Russia’s main attacking force. That does not necessarily make things easier for the Krasnodar striker, though. Smolov has been the top Russian goalscorer in two of the past three seasons but is nowhere near as prolific for the national team. What is the realistic aim for Russia at the World Cup and why? A place in the last 16. After the draw Russians thought their team were lucky to be in such an easy group, but since December Mohamed Salah has become one of the strongest players in the world, which has planted seeds of doubt about the host nation’s ability to get through. Progress from Group A would probably be rewarded with a tie against Spain or Portugal – and Russia’s journey will almost certainly finish at that point .Gosha Chernov writes for Sport-Express.

football,"• Manager targets victory in final against Real Madrid• ‘We have shown how good we are. Now we have to win.’
Andy Hunter in Kiev

Jürgen Klopp has called on Liverpool to deliver another exhibition of “big balls football” to defeat Real Madrid in the Champions League final and launch a new era of European success for the club.“We are Liverpool, we are different,” Klopp said as he looked to Saturday’s game in Kiev with firm confidence. The German coach has lost his past five finals, two with Liverpool and three with Borussia Dortmund, and confronts a Madrid team attempting to become the first club since Bayern Munich in 1976 to win a hat-trick of European Cups. Liverpool, however, are the highest-scoring team in this season’s competition and Klopp believes his players pose a unique threat to the European champions.The Liverpool manager said: “This is just the start, 100%. I don’t know exactly why I think it constantly but we are Liverpool. We have been different the whole campaign and we want to be different again in that final. You go through and analyse and you see this, you see that, but they never played us. We are not always but we can be different. That’s really important.“That’s why we are in the final, not because we are the best team in the competition and everybody thought before the season: ‘Yeah, it will be Liverpool and whoever.’ It was exactly the other way around. The boys played a kind of football that was different. We had so many game-changing moments. Unbelievable. These moments, we had them 500 times and we need them again. Not waiting for something, not hoping for something, no; change the game in the moments you can change it and that’s it.”Klopp’s confidence is based on performances that he claims have reached a new level in the Champions League this season, with Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané scoring 29 of the team’s 40 goals.Marking a departure from the heavy metal football for which he is synonymous, the manager explained: “The home games were like: ‘Wow, what’s that?’ It was kind of a new level in the Champions League in these games. It was not that we were so much better but it was so different, so brave, it was big balls football. I really loved it. The power we had against City for example was like: ‘What’s that?’ They were better in all the other parts of the game, yes they played until they were in our six-yard box, but when we were in possession it was massive. It’s difficult to do but the boys did it and now we have to do it again.”Liverpool are competing in their eighth European Cup final and first for 11 years, with all five victories coming against teams wearing an all-white strip. Irrespective of the omen against Madrid, Klopp believes Saturday represents the start of a prolonged return for Liverpool to the European elite.“To qualify for the final shows that you are back,” he said. “To win it? You need a little bit of luck and stuff like that. But we are back. We have shown how good we are. Now we have to win the game. We have to continue on the way. Even if you win, you cannot stop. If you lose, you cannot stop.“I really like the way we are as a club, as a team. This week, the only thing that is important is the final. But, in general, it is important that the club goes in the right direction. That is very positive. I said to the boys before the semi-final that I don’t think we are the last time here.”Klopp has backed Salah to take over from Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi as the world’s best player: “Mo has the potential to go there over the next few years … but it is not that easy.”In response Sergio Ramos was dismissive of the idea that Salah could be likened to his Madrid team-mate or Messi after one stellar season. “Comparing players with Ronaldo and Messi is something you can’t do – they’re in another orbit,” Ramos said. “There are players who are in fashion, those who appear briefly and disappear and others who stay around. Salah is a top player, that’s clear. He’s shown that this year and he’s got a great chance to show that over the next few years as Ronaldo and Messi have done, but the day after tomorrow!”"

For a moment there was silence and then there was a small smattering of applause. At the Liverpool end, they were stunned, and they were not alone. The goal that won the European Cup had to be watched twice and they still couldn’t believe it; even the replay on the giant screen didn’t entirely shake them out of it. For the second time, the second Real Madrid goal, they were left wondering whether that had really happened. The first goal was surreal, perhaps the stupidest the European Cup final has seen; the second was sublime, perhaps even the most brilliant. Gareth Bale had been on the pitch for only two minutes when he took flight. High in the Kiev sky, he connected with a wonderful overhead kick.Bale ran to the corner and threw himself to the turf, sliding face down. Cristiano Ronaldo followed his team-mates over to the Welshman. On the far touchline Zinedine Zidane could barely believe it. He scored the winning goal in the European Cup final at Hampden Park 16 years ago, a volley that became emblematic. When Ronaldo scored an overhead kick in Turin in the quarter-final this year, Juventus’s fans had stood to applaud. Afterwards, Zidane had been asked about it. “Mine was nicer,” he smiled, a twinkle in his eye. Even he may admit that Bale’s was better, just as even Karim Benzema may admit that his goal was the worst he has scored in his career.Between them, Bale and Benzema, assisted by Sergio Ramos and Loris Karius, had taken Madrid to a third title in a row, history made. For Bale, it is his fourth title since moving to Spain. It may yet be his last. Asked afterwards about a move to the Premier League he said: “I need to be playing week-in, week-out and that hasn’t happened this season for one reason or another ... I have to sit down in the summer and discuss my future with my agent and take it from there.”If this was his final game for Madrid, it was some way to bid farewell. Or perhaps it can be a new beginning, a revival. It was, after all, a moment beyond the reach of the plausible, like something out of a comic. An astonishing goal to which he later added with a long shot that slipped through the hands of the Liverpool goalkeeper, who was inconsolable at the end. Karius curled himself into a ball, face hidden in his shirt; Bale stood, arms aloft. The European Cup final was won and by a moment worthy of any final. Madrid had not always impressed, but the goal certainly did. Until then, and speaking of comic, the final had been marked by two moments. Karius throwing the ball against Benzema’s boot and into the net and before that, Ramos dragging Mohamed Salah to the ground, forcing him out of this final, and seeming to change the game entirely – even if Liverpool did find an equaliser, thus requiring Zidane to call on Bale. So, on he came, to score the decisive second and a third that made it safe. Left out to start with, he was named man of the match. Scorer in Lisbon, successful in the shootout in Milan, he had done it again in the Ukraine. Twice.Bale’s absence from the starting XI was not out of keeping with his season: it had started on Valentine’s Day, when he was left out against Paris Saint-Germain, an unexpected decision which was soon revealed as no one-off, not least because of the sense that he did too little to rebel when he came on, accused of disengaging. In the second leg he was again left on the bench. In Turin it was the same and, although he started the second leg, he was withdrawn at half-time, with the team 2-0 down. He withdrew at full-time too, while his team-mates celebrated.“I had to do something,” Zidane said afterwards. But, Bale wondered, did it have to be that? There had been no explanation, no conversation; he and Zidane did not talk.Against Bayern Munich there was more of the same. Madrid had made it to the final but he had played only 99 of 540 minutes in the knockout phases. And yet, his performance in Villarreal last week, widely assumed to be a dress rehearsal, the gathering speed and the specifics of Liverpool, had brought him back into a focus, a candidate to be included from the start for the final. Instead, it was the same XI than began in Cardiff in last year’s final, Benzema beginning ahead of him; then, Bale was injured, here there was no excuse. No consolation, either – that would come later, and how.When Madrid’s subs came out to warm up, the Welshman did not join them. That is not so abnormal, but as a staging of his separateness it is still striking. He too had become resigned to the probability of a departure. Bale, though, knew that there might always be a chance, that at least he could go the right way. Liverpool knew that Madrid could change the game from the bench in a way that they could not. A couple of months ago it had been suggested to him that for all that he had not been playing, for all that he had thought his time at Madrid was ending, and that much as he probably would not start in Kiev, he would come on and win the final. And so it proved. Even if he had believed it, he would not have imagined it like this. An overhead kick, a long shot that Karius dropped into the net, and a fourth European Cup. No Briton has ever won more."

“I have a problem,” Bojan Krkic says, edging forward on the sofa. “I love football, it’s my life.” Outside, through the balcony doors, the sun dips behind Vitoria, northern Spain.His homeland is one of five countries in which he has played. He started at Barcelona, where he became their youngest player to make a league debut, and then had spells at Roma, Milan and Ajax. He joined Stoke in 2014 before loans at Mainz and now Alavés. He has won four league titles and the European Cup twice, been a world champion and played alongside some of the finest footballers of a generation. He has scored in La Liga, Serie A, Eredivisie, the Premier League and the Bundesliga, and he is proud of all that. So it might sound like a strange sort of problem to have but there is something in it.The question had been whether he had ever considered leaving it all behind, and it is not one he dismisses outright. Ultimately football, the game itself, conquers all but thrown into it at 17, the pressure intense and the environment unforgiving, Bojan had much to conquer too. The anxiety attacks that denied him a piece of history with Spain have been overcome but he still challenges the expectation surrounding him and much of what gathers around the game.That is one of the reasons why England had such an impact. Bojan has watched Stoke’s relegation from afar and he talks about how supporters were convinced to embrace a new identity and type of football, describing that as a “big victory” and lamenting the moment they turned back again. He talks of a kind of purity found in England. “There’s a phrase: ‘Fútbol, qué bonito eras’ [football, how lovely you were] ... back when there was no social media, when it was football,” he says. “And that’s the feeling I had in England: the smell of it, the essence.”It is something he fears is being lost elsewhere, aware of what goes with being a player, “powerful forces you can’t control, opinions you can’t stop”, a society where “jealousy predominates” and “everyone has access to you”.“You have to not let it affect you but that’s not always easy,” he admits. “Those of us who have feeling, who are sensitive, who can be affected, need a good shield. Footballers are very young and they’re exposed. Even at under-15s, players have Twitter and I’m sure they’re already getting insults ... it’s ugly, it sullies society and football.”Perhaps it is no surprise that when he retires he hopes to teach football, and life, to young players. Bojan can talk from experience. When he joined Stoke he was 23 and he is still only 27, but it feels like a long time has passed since his Barcelona debut. He scored 900 goals in their youth system and says “that accompanies you your entire career”. It was just over a fortnight after his 17th birthday when he first played in La Liga, breaking the record of a player he was supposed to match. His name: Lionel Messi.“It all happened very quick,” Bojan says. “In footballing terms it went well but not personally. I had to live with that and people say my career hasn’t been as expected. When I came up, it was ‘new Messi’. Well, yes, if you compare me with Messi … but what career did you expect? And there are lots of things that people didn’t know. I didn’t go to the [2008] European Championship because of anxiety issues but we said I was going on holiday. I was called up for Spain against France, my international debut, and it was said that I had gastroenteritis when I had an anxiety attack. But no one wants to talk about that. Football’s not interested.”I had to live with people saying my career hasn’t been as expected. Yes, if you compare me with Messi … but what career did you expect?Let’s talk about it, then. It matters. “At 17 my life changed entirely. I went to the Under-17 World Cup in July and no one knew me; when I came back, I couldn’t even walk down the road. A few days later I made my debut against Osasuna, three or four days later I play in the Champions League, then I score against Villarreal, then Spain called [in February 2008]. And it was all good but your head fills until there’s a moment that your body says ‘stop’.“Anxiety affects everyone differently. I spoke to someone who felt like their heart was beating 1,000 times a minute. With me, it was a dizziness, feeling sick, constant, 24 hours a day,” Bojan says, signalling his head. “There was a pressure here, powerful, never going away. I was fine when I went into the dressing room for the France game but I started to feel this powerful dizziness, overwhelmed, panicked, and they lay me on the physio’s bench. That was the first time but I had nasty episodes like that again. There’s medicine, psychological treatment to overcome the barriers you’ve erected, the fear. It started in February and it lasted until the summer. When the Euros came I decided I couldn’t go, that I had to isolate myself.“Everyone at the federation knew: Luis Aragonés [the manager], Fernando Hierro [the sporting director]. Hierro sent me messages every week to ask how I was and the day before the squad was announced, they rang. ‘Bojan, we’re going to call you up.’ I was in the car, going to training. I said: ‘It hurts to say this but I can’t.’ I got to the Camp Nou and Carles Puyol was there. He said: ‘Bojan, I’ll be by your side all the way, I’ll be there for you.’ I said: ‘Puyi, I can’t.’ I’m on medication, I’m on the edge. And the next day I saw a headline: ‘Spain call up Bojan and Bojan says no.’“That headline kills me, it’s as if I don’t care. I remember being in Murcia and people insulting me: they don’t know, they just think I don’t want to play. That was hard, although at that point I really didn’t care what people said. What hurt was that the headline presumably came from the Federation. How can you call me up when you speak to me the day before, know how I am, and then that comes out? I felt very alone. There are still people now who ask me: ‘Why didn’t you go?’”Why did Bojan not explain it then? “I was scared. I was ill. I was overwhelmed. I didn’t know what I was doing. I remember doing a Barça TV interview saying I needed a holiday. I knew it wasn’t the right thing … [but] at that age you don’t know and the bomb had already exploded. We just tried to extinguish the fire. I felt that I had to escape, any way I could. Ten years on, I look back and [the reaction] doesn’t surprise me. People struggle to admit things aren’t going well and what matters to football is that all’s OK, gloss over it.You still have the scar. It doesn’t open but you can feel it pull at times, a reminder“You still have the scar. It doesn’t open but you can feel it pull at times, a reminder. I was young, you overcome things quickly, but in media terms, the way people see you, that did me some damage.”Bojan had been built up as a player to mark a generation. In his absence, Spain began the most successful era in history. After four years he departed the Camp Nou. He has played for six clubs in the seven seasons since. “It would have been easy to stay at Barcelona and not play but I needed to go,” he says. “Maybe at times I should have been more patient but I’ve always been honest making decisions [to move]; I always wanted to play. You have your path – Italy, Holland, Germany, England – but Barcelona conditions everything. People don’t value what you do. There’s this line: ‘Let’s see if Bojan gets back to his best level.’ But what’s the best level? Every season I’ve reached that level, sometimes more consistently, sometimes less, but I’ve always competed well.“One thing people have said to me, is that if I had been more of an hijo de puta, a cabrón [a son of a bitch, an arsehole] … And the higher up you get the more you have to be one. But I say: ‘I can’t.’ And when I have tried to play a nastier role on the pitch, I’ve lost it completely.”In training at Alavés, when Bojan and Munir El Haddadi are put in the same rondo, the club captain shouts: “Look out, there are four Champions Leagues in here,” Bojan says with a grin. “After the [2009] Champions League I was talking to Thierry Henry and he said: ‘I came here to win my first.’ I thought: ‘Wow, this guy who’s the absolute business, wins his first at 30-something and here I am, at 18.’ There are players who never even play a Champions League game, so I feel privileged.“And the most important thing isn’t the trophies, it’s the experiences, what you lived, what’s here in your heart, what you know, what you live. No one can ever steal that from you. And those people who spoke ill of you, they’ll forget. If Víctor Valdés, the greatest goalkeeper in Barcelona’s history, has been forgotten, how could they not forget me? And then it’ll be just me and what will be left will be the pride, the moments, unique moments lots of players have never lived.“I love football and no one will ever take that from me. I’m proud of my career, proud of what I have lived, and even if there are hard moments, including this year, you have to be strong. I will always love football, always, I’m still young, I enjoy playing, and I have no intention of stopping yet.”"
football,"José Mourinho’s dig at Antonio Conte has diverted attention from the FA Cup final’s pivotal confrontation in which Chelsea’s midfield could be overrun by Manchester United
Jonathan Wilson

“I’m not,” José Mourinho said after Manchester United’s home win over Liverpool in March, “the kind of mechanic coach that says player A pass to player B, player B pass to player C and player C to player D. I’m much more a supporter of preparing the players to decide well and feel the game.”As so often with Mourinho, there was perhaps a coded jibe; this may have been (it’s very hard to know for sure with a man whose every utterance is subjected to intense scrutiny) another sortie in his protracted war of words with Antonio Conte. For the Italian is a manager who has his side practise “automations”, as Eden Hazard calls them. Conte does see the value in practising set moves, to be deployed during games when the disposition of players on the pitch is right.The notion of planned moves is common in modern football and has a history stretching back at least as far as Valeriy Lobanovskyi. His great collaborator Anatoliy Zelentsov compared them to gambits in chess, pre-formed strategies to be adapted and applied in game situations. In football, the advantage is obvious: if players know where they should be moving, who is likely to be in space and where the ball should be played, everything is speeded up. The devastating counterattacks of Joachim Löw’s Germany, particularly at the 2010 World Cup, are a more recent example.Mourinho thinks those preset moves are overly prescriptive and that, in a game as random as football, they can be counterproductive. He prefers to inculcate in his players the mindset to make the best decisions in any situation. There is no right or wrong answer. Those sides who prefer automations are perhaps a little quicker, those who have been imbued with the appropriate mindset more plastic, more versatile.The dig was in the use of the word “mechanic”. Conte had described Mourinho as “making cinema”, in the way he used press conferences to deflect and shape the story around games; this was Mourinho’s reply. Perhaps he was a director, an artist but rather that than being bluntly functional, than being mechanistic.There is an irony there in that Conte, whose footballing method involves practising set moves was attacking Mourinho for taking the same approach into his dealings with the media, for “preparing to have a cinema in the press conference”, whereas he was more spontaneous, more willing to react to circumstance.Beyond the rabbit hole of mind games and abstract arguments about how best to condition players, the key to Saturday’s FA Cup final looks likely to be how the midfields match up. Conte’s experiment with a 3‑5‑1‑1, which placed undue pressure on Hazard as the creative hub, looks to have been abandoned, and he will probably set up in the 3-4-2-1 with which they won the title last season.The danger of that approach was seen in the sides’ meeting at Old Trafford in February when Chelsea, having taken the lead, were overrun and could have lost by far more than 2-1. Although Hazard and – probably – Willian operating in those inside-forward positions can drift into areas that are extremely difficult for opponents to pick up, if they become detached from the play, it can lead to the two deeper-lying midfielders – most likely N’Golo Kanté and Cesc Fàbregas – being overwhelmed by the three central midfielders in United’s 4-3-3.That is a particular issue if the wing-backs who could otherwise have helped out in midfield are forced back by United’s wide forwards, probably Alexis Sánchez and Jesse Lingard, making runs into the space behind them. That would also free up United’s full-backs, allowing them to get forward or, more likely, offer support in negating Willian and Hazard.It’s mark of Chelsea’s decline this season that it seems natural to view the game from a perspective of how United are likely to unsettle them. Last season, there would have been confidence that their press, plus the defensive screen offered by Kanté and Nemanja Matic, would have meant it was United’s wide forwards being driven back by the wing-backs Victor Moses and Marcos Alonso. There would have been concerns as to whether United’s flanking midfielders could offer sufficient support to their holding player to handle Hazard and Willian.Although United beat Chelsea in April 2017 at Old Trafford, they lost at Stamford Bridge earlier in the campaign, in the league and FA Cup. An attacking capacity reduced by the sale of Diego Costa and a midfield diminished by the sale of Matic, Chelsea are a much lesser force than they were a year ago. The squad have been weakened by the club’s transfer business, confidence has dropped and, with Conte seemingly certain to leave, there is not the intensity of last season.And that is the difficulty of assessing methodologies, tactical schema and theoretical approaches: there is always something else going on."

José Mourinho is targeting Ajax’s Justin Kluivert this summer, with the 19-year-old favouring a move to Manchester United.Kluivert, the son of the former Barcelona and Netherlands centre-forward Patrick, has been in contract discussions with Ajax. It is understood talks have broken down because of his demand to be the highest-paid player at the club.Kluivert asked for a sizeable rise to €1.5m (£1.3m) a year and a proportion of any transfer fee to be split between him and his agent, Mino Raiola. Ajax’s policy is to pay no player more than €1m, so Kluivert demanded a significant signing-on fee.Kluivert scored 10 goals in 30 league games this season and believes he deserves fresh terms to reflect his growing status. He is on the wage of his initial professional contract, signed in 2016, which ends next summer. Kluivert made his international debut in March, as a replacement in the Netherlands’ 3-0 win over Portugal.Kluivert likes to play as a wide forward and can operate on either wing. Mourinho was a coach at Barcelona in the late 1990s when Patrick Kluivert played for the club.Mourinho’s interest in Kluivert casts further doubt over the future of Anthony Martial. The 22-year-old has been unable to hold down a starting place. The United manager criticised him after last Friday’s 1-0 defeat at Brighton and he was on the bench for Thursday’s goalless draw at West Ham.Mourinho said Romelu Lukaku may be fit enough for a place on the bench for next Saturday’s FA Cup final against Chelsea. The striker has missed United’s past two matches with an ankle injury and will be absent when they host Watford on Sunday. “We hope he can play the final,” Mourinho said. “He is in Belgium having his treatment with communication between the Belgian doctors and our medical department. We are just waiting to see if it is possible for him to be involved in the final. If not starting, at least on the bench.”Mourinho said Marcus Rashford and Martial would return against Watford. There will also be starts for Sergio Romero, Eric Bailly, Daley Blind and Juan Mata, and Michael Carrick will be captain in his final appearance before joining United’s coaching staff. “He is not going to finish the match because I want him to leave the pitch alone and I want him to feel what the Manchester United supporters feel about him,” the manager added of Carrick."

Considering Manchester United are still occasionally forced to rely on defences entirely sourced by Sir Alex Ferguson, it’s no surprise to learn that José Mourinho is in the market for a few more decent stoppers he can call his own. Having gone rogue at Tottenham last season, Toby Alderweireld features prominently on José’s summer shopping list and the Mirror reports that talks have begun between the two clubs over a potential switch. A rather exorbitant £75m is the fee being mentioned for the 29-year-old Belgian. In the event of Alderweireld’s seemingly inevitable departure, Tottenham may try to replace him with West Brom central defender Ahmed Hegazi, who is also wanted by Leicester and West Ham. Salomón Rondón is one of several players likely to leave the Hawthorns, with both Atlético Madrid and Inter believed to be interested in signing the busy Venezuelan.Manchester United are hoping to sign the Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder Fred within the fortnight, while his compatriot Willian may join him from Chelsea at a later date. Italian sports daily the Corriere dello Sport reports that Liverpool will try to sign Milan goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma once the Reds have got the important business of Saturday’s Champions League final out of the way, while a photograph of Chelsea striker Álvaro Morata hanging around with Juventus sporting director Fabio Paratici in Milan yesterday has got tongues wagging. Morata endured a difficult first season in the Premier League and has also been linked with a move to Milan.Manchester City are hoping to wrap up their move for Leicester City winger Riyad Mahrez in the next week or so, but the two clubs have yet to agree a fee. City were hoping to get their man for £50m with the £15m-rated winger Patrick Roberts thrown in for good measure, but Leicester are holding out for £60m, plus the 21-year-old, who has spent the past two seasons on loan at Celtic. Roberts was blighted by injury last season and started just 12 games for Celtic. He was last spotted looking a bit miffed in the dug-out when it became apparent he would not be getting a farewell run-out as a substitute against Motherwell in the Scottish Cup final last weekend.The Washington Post has revealed that Wayne Rooney is in the American capital to talk turkey with DC United. Rooney is not expected to sign for the MLS club this week, but is in the States on something of a fact-finding mission to check out the lay of the land and possibly undergo a medical.Meanwhile in Scotland, Rangers manager Steven Gerrard had been hoping to sign his former Liverpool team-mate Martin Skrtel from Fenerbahce for £2.7m, but the Slovakian defender’s agent says the Scottish club simply can’t afford the kind of wages his client is getting at the Turkish club. “When there is only a small difference then you can find a solution,” said Karol Csonto. “But in this case, the salary of the player in Turkey is four or five times more than what Rangers could offer. That makes it impossible.” Gerrard may have better luck luring Liverpool youngsters Harry Wilson, Ryan Kent and Ben Woodburn to Ibrox on season-long loans. "

As a metaphor, it is hardly the most subtle. Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling has had a tattoo of a M16 assault rifle inked on his right calf. “I shoot with my right foot, so it has a deeper meaning,” he explained in a statement issued after the Sun splashed with the headline: “Raheem shoots himself in foot.”Anti-gun advocates have described the tattoo as “totally unacceptable” and “sickening”. The founder of Mothers Against Guns, Lucy Cope, said: “This tattoo is disgusting. Raheem should hang his head in shame.” With the World Cup barely a couple of weeks away, there have been calls for him to be dropped from the England squad unless he has the tattoo removed, covered, or his leg chopped off. So far, so familiar.While it would be hard to argue that Sterling’s tattoo is the acme of role-modelling body art, the Sun’s “exclusive” is not really about the tattoo, and what it represents. It is more about a vicious tabloid snobbery.The character assassinations are as endless as they are bizarre. He can’t win. He’s either too tight (buying clothes from Primark while earning £180,000 a week, eating pasties at Greggs while signing for City for almost £50m, taking an £80 easyJet trip while earning £200,000 a week) or too flash (his fleet of cars, the private jet he hired to take him on two holidays in a week).He is the “love rat” who dared to propose to his long-term girlfriend Paige Milian, the snake who looked “TIRED” at a party at 3am (yes, tired!), the scoundrel who bought his mother a nice sink despite failing to win the World Cup, the reprobate who drove a “FILTHY £50K Mercedes”.In April, this culminated in possibly the most shocking of Sterling exposés – after failing to win the young player of the year award (he finished third), he shamelessly went out for a spot of breakfast in his “£120,000 pimped-up Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon”. Worse, the wretch looked, according to the Daily Mail, “relaxed”.There is, of course, a different story that could be written about Sterling – the England star who, aged 20, became the most expensive British player in history to sign for another domestic club; who already has 37 international caps; who has played a vital part in Manchester City becoming the first football team to win 100 points in a single Premier League season; and who has overcome the toughest start in life (his father was shot dead in Kingston, Jamaica, when he was two years old) to become a global superstar.Which takes us back to the tattoo. In his statement, Sterling also said: “When I was two my father died from being gunned down to death. I made a promise to myself I would never touch a gun in my lifetime.” Yes, he might regret his tattoo in years to come – and he certainly wouldn’t be the first 23-year-old to regret one. But, as an image, it does make sense; a reminder of all that he despises, of all that has been taken away from him. Or maybe he is saying that the killing of his father made him the man he is today; that he has triumphed over adversity, enabled one form of deadly shooting to become the inspiration for another.And as he pointed out, the tattoo isn’t even finished yet. He might surround the rifle with flowers and a golden sun, as Banksy did in Boy With a Gun, or with the words NEVER AGAIN. Maybe it will prove to be a profound statement against violence – Sterling’s personal Guernica. If it is, the Sun will doubtless accuse him of theft under the headline: “Robbing Raheem plunders Picasso.”"

It is very hard to compare players of different generations, almost impossible. Tactics, equipment, rules – so many things have changed. Manuel Neuer and Oliver Kahn have shaped goalkeeping as well as Sepp Maier. Nevertheless, I think that Maier is the best of his guild in Germany and he’s my goalkeeper. He was a clown on and off the field. But in the game he was always fully focused and concentrated.With all respect for players such as Pelé, Johan Cruyff, Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, for me Franz Beckenbauer continues to be the best player in the world of all time. He has united all attributes you must have to have success. And nobody is as complete as he was as a football player. Franz was perfect in everything he did. That’s why people worldwide still recall the name Beckenbaur when asked about football in Germany. Mats Hummels reminds me a lot of him. The way he is leading the defence with Bayern and the national team, so calm and composed, impresses me so much. And he is even getting better from game to game, so he joins Beckenbauer in central defence. Talking about intelligence on the field nobody can mess with Philipp Lahm. He has proved for years that the body does not imply how assertive a player is. All top stars have tried to crack this nut. Lahm nearly always stayed victorious with fair means. As Lahm had such a perfect sense of tactics he was the extended arm of the coach too. The same counts for Paul Breitner, my other full-back. I can’t remember any bad pass when playing with him. He was “Mr. Zuverlässig” (Mr Reliable) and he always made the right decision in the right situation.Coming to the midfielders, it’s really a hard choice. Germany have had so many outstanding players in this position. During my career, I’ve played often against Pierre Littbarski. He was a painful opponent, because you never knew which way he was going in the next second. His dribbling was unpredictable and he surprised me again and again, so he is in. Lothar Matthäus has characterised an era with his style of playing. For me he is not far behind Beckenbauer in terms of fame worldwide. The football fans around the world still know Matthäus. He was versatile, our engine on the pitch and a true leader. Günter Netzer was the playmaker you dreamed of. He had an incredible overview and it seemed that he had already planned the whole 90 minutes before kick-off. When he had an idea, it was put into practise 100% the way he wanted it, so he completes my midfield.When it comes to strikers there is no getting around Gerd Müller. I don’t need to talk a lot about our “Bomber of the Nation”. He scored when there was no chance to score. Out of nothing. Again and again. Really impressive. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge is a strong character as CEO of FC Bayern and he was as a player too. A natural born leader. With his strong body he commands respect. It was nearly impossible to beat him in aerial battles. And his finishing skills were perfect. Finally I choose Rudi Völler as third striker. He set standards in terms of fighting spirit and commitment. And on top of that Rudi was a real gentleman. Young players of today should take a leaf out of his book."

Rafael Márquez’s long and eventful career could contain one more twist after he was named in Mexico’s preliminary squad for next month’s World Cup.The former Barcelona defender is considered one of the finest players in Mexican history but it appeared his international career had ended after he was named in an US Treasury investigation into drug trafficking in August 2017. The last of his 143 caps for Mexico came in the 2017 Confederations Cup, just before news of the investigation emerged.Márquez denies any wrongdoing and has not been convicted of any crimes. If Márquez does make the final squad for Russia 2018, he will be only the fourth man to feature at five World Cups, joining Germany’s Lothar Matthaus, Italy’s Gianluigi Buffon and fellow Mexican Antonio Carbajal. Márquez has said he intends to retire after the tournament. Teams must submit their final, 23-man squads by 4 June.A notable absence from the squad was Jonathan Gonzalez, the talented Californian who represented USA at youth level but switched to El Tri in January. Jonathan and Giovani dos Santos of LA Galaxy and Real Betis’ Andres Guardado are both injury concerns but have been included in the preliminary squad.Mexico face a tough test if they are to reach the knockout round. They open their campaign against world champions Germany before games against South Korea and Sweden.Goalkeepers Guillermo Ochoa (Standard Liege), Alfredo Talavera (Toluca), Jesus Corona (Cruz Azul)Defenders Diego Reyes (FC Porto), Carlos Salcedo (Eintracht Frankfurt), Hector Moreno (Real Sociedad), Oswaldo Alanis (Getafe), Nestor Araujo (Santos Laguna), Miguel Layun (Sevilla), Jesus Gallardo (Pumas), Hugo Ayala (Tigres), Edson Alvarez (America)Midfielders Hector Herrera (Porto), Andres Guardado (Real Betis), Rafa Márquez (Atlas), Jonathan dos Santos (LA Galaxy), Marco Fabian (Eintracht Frankfurt), Jesus Molina (Monterrey), Erick Gutierrez (Pachuca), Giovani dos Santos (LA Galaxy)Forwards Javier Aquino (Tigres), Jesus “Tecatito” Corona (Porto), Raul Jimenez (Benfica), Oribe Peralta (Club America), Javier Hernandez (West Ham United), Carlos Vela (LAFC), Hirving Lozano (PSV Eindhoven), Jurgen Damm (Tigres)"

Ils sont les meilleurs.Sie sind die Besten.These are the champions!At least they are if you squint a little. When Liverpool and Real Madrid walk out at the Olympic Stadium in Kiev, neck hairs prickling to the wonderfully overblown strains of Tony Britten’s choral Champions League theme, they will do so in the capacity of genuine European aristocracy.By the end of Saturday night these two clubs will have won five of the past 14 Champions Leagues between them and almost a third of all European Cups since the competition was born more than half a century ago.There is a purity even in the prospect of meringue white versus Anfield red, a skein of emotional authenticity in the flags, the songs, that shared folk memory of so many other floodlit triumphs.There is, of course, another side to this. Some will question the right of either team to proclaim themselves the best in Europe when between them these two champions in waiting finished a combined 42 points behind Manchester City and Barcelona in the weekly grind.Not that there’s anything new in this. The last reigning domestic champions to lift Europe’s shiniest trophy were the peak Messi-Pep Barcelona of 2011, evidence either of the dilution of the competition’s purity or of its sheer depth of quality, depending on where you choose to stand.This time, though, the disjunct is pronounced. For Madrid a fourth title in five years would install this team as unassailable masters of the modern age. At home they have two league titles in the past decade. Liverpool haven’t been champions of England in more than a quarter of a century. Die Meister. Die Besten. Les grandes équipes!And yet for all the gripes there are certain unassailable qualities in both these finalists, peaks that have been beyond the rest of Europe this year. Not least that visceral commitment to attack embodied in the headline acts Cristiano Ronaldo and Mo Salah.Nobody else has scored more goals in the competition this season than these two teams. Nobody else has had more shots on target or attacked with such cavalier conviction. Liverpool have scored or conceded 53 goals in the tournament proper en route to Kiev, Madrid 45.By way of comparison, Manchester United conceded five and scored 13 across eight games in the course of a meek last-16 exit that felt as if it came from another sporting age altogether.Attacking football is in vogue, state of the art among winning teams, although not simply the annihilating slow death of possession football. Liverpool are 10th when it comes to average minutes in possession of the ball this year, Madrid fifth. Victory has instead come through periods of sustained attacking heat, a way of playing that some have called the surge or the blitz.Liverpool did not win in Germany, Portugal and Manchester by wearing their opponents down but by conjuring up those famous attacking spells, moments where they simply flip the switch and enter the Red Zone, a team playing through a kind of synchronised rage.Madrid were almost laughably fortunate in the second leg of their semi-final against Bayern Munich at the Bernabéu, hanging on as the ball trickled or dribbled away from the vital touch so often that there was a kind of hysteria in the stands by the end. But that tie, like the previous round against Juventus, was won by trusting in the cutting edge at the other end, the absolute conviction that at some point those strengths will tell. To borrow a line from Gary Player, the more Real Madrid keep on winning the Champions League in haphazard attacking fashion the luckier they seem to get.Either way, the vocal majority who seemed so underwhelmed by the dogged, reactive football on show in Saturday’s FA Cup final can at least be assured of something else in Kiev. There will be extremes of attacking intent. There will be defensive slackness. There will be goals.Talking of which: enter the big two. It is, of course, misguided to obsess over individuals in what is more than ever a team sport. But this is unlikely to stop anyone doing it – relentlessly, and with an increasing reverence for the power of the star player, a sport of endless close-ups and grand-scale personality obsession.The Champions League final dishes up a little more in the way of ultimacy here, with a meeting of Ronaldo and Salah: football’s reigning golden goal-dalek, the current owner of the Ballon d’Or, versus the Premier League’s own man of the season.It has been almost too easy to pitch this final as a shootout between two players who have 25 Champions League goals between them. But sometimes you just have to go with it, not least when both embody and enact the most extreme strengths of their own team; and when they have a little more in common as players than might at first seem the case.Zinedine Zidane has already announced that he wouldn’t take Salah in his Madrid team. It is hard to imagine him saying anything else on the eve of the final, just as there is no real comparison to be made here, at least not yet. Ronaldo is an all-time phenomenon, remarkable for his sustained, relentless productivity. Salah has been operating somewhere close to this for nine months now.But still, we are in the late days now of the Messi-Ronaldo godhead, a conjoined supremacy that has been soundtracked by a rolling sub-debate about succession, about the next of the next-besters. Salah’s 42 goals this season (to Ronaldo’s 41) have elevated his status, a newbie face among that raft of pretenders.In terms of style – left-footed, jinky, shaggy-haired – Salah has most often been compared to Messi. But the fact is that he is probably closer to Ronaldo. Both run relentlessly, popping up in the top five attackers for metres covered in the Champions League this season.Like a mid-20s Ronaldo, Salah is a power-runner with wonderfully quick feet and the ability at his best to basically make the game up in front of him. Salah is yet to reach anywhere near the same heights. But in his best moments he looks a bit like a product of some advanced gene-splicing Ronaldo-Messi experiments: the body of a shaggy-haired, left-footed jinker, but the direct style of a sprinter, a cutting edge rather than a playmaker.In Kiev, Salah and Ronaldo will once again be key to the attacking tempo of the competition’s two highest scoring teams. There has been a slight adaption with Madrid. These days they like to push you back and keep possession, to load balls into the box knowing Ronaldo will eventually find the tiny pocket of air he requires to combination punch the ball into the back of the net.With Liverpool the best moments have all been about the surge and the blitz, led so often by Salah. The Olympic Stadium was originally known as the Red Stadium of Trotsky, and after that as the just the Red Stadium. The ability of the team and their fans to turn the air red on Saturday night, to generate that shared driving energy, will be key to Liverpool’s chances. Either way, it promises to be a thrilling, extreme and in its own way entirely apt meeting of the knockout cavaliers."

Ian Holloway has left QPR with immediate effect, the Championship club have announced, amid reports that the former England manager Steve McClaren is to replace him.The 55-year-old joined Rangers for a second spell as manager in November 2016, signing a two-and-a-half year deal. But Holloway has departed with 12 months remaining on his contract after QPR finished 16th in the Championship this season. He oversaw 80 games, winning 26, drawing 14 and losing 40.An announcement about his successor will be made “in due course,” QPR said, with McClaren the early bookmakers’ favourite. McClaren worked at QPR for three months under Harry Redknapp in 2013 before his appointment as Derby’s manager.The club’s chief executive, Lee Hoos, said: “We are hugely grateful to Ian for his incredible efforts during his time with us.“He joined us at a critical stage as we looked to reduce the wage bill, bring in younger talent and remain competitive on the pitch at the same time. That is no easy task and it was down to his desire, love for the club and hard work that he achieved those goals.“However, we are now looking to take the next step as we continue to work through what is a vital period of transition for the football club.”During Holloway’s first spell at the club, between 2001 and 2006, he secured promotion from the third tier and established Rangers back in the Championship.Elsewhere, Barnet and Martin Allen have parted company for the fifth time. The club reappointed Allen in March in a late attempt to secure League Two survival but despite an upturn in results the Bees fell short and were relegated from the Football League last weekend.Allen said he had decided not to remain at The Hive. “It’s been an amazing, unforgettable eight weeks with all the players and the positive energy and the enthusiasm from all the supporters has been quite overwhelming and I can’t thank you enough,” he said.“The chairman has offered me a fantastic contract, offered to increase the budget and had done everything he could and no blame whatsoever can be put his way. For me, it was eight weeks and I am happy but of course underneath I’m bitterly disappointed and still very upset that we were unable to retain our position in the Football League.”Bury have appointed Ryan Lowe as manager on a permanent basis. Lowe, who signed a two-year contract on Thursday, has been in temporary charge at Gigg Lane since January and though the 39-year-old oversaw an improvement in results he was unable to prevent relegation to League Two."

Football Federation Australia has been forced to deny the selection of Tim Cahill in Australia’s latest World Cup squad is linked to a commercial partnership after the striker was revealed as the main focus of a marketing campaign for the Socceroos’ main sponsor, Caltex, a day before coach Bert van Marwijk confirmed a list of 26 players still in contention to go to Russia.Cahill, 38, has retained a chance of appearing – and scoring – at a fourth consecutive World Cup after Van Marwijk confirmed on Tuesday the group who he will take to Turkey for a pre-tournament training camp. That list will be further trimmed by three players before the squad head to Russia in readiness for their opening game against France on 16 June.Despite his status as the Socceroos’ all-time leading goalscorer, Cahill was not considered a shoo-in considering his lack of game time and goals since leaving the A-League and Melbourne City before landing at English Championship side Millwall. Since re-signing for his former club, Cahill played fewer than 100 minutes in 10 substitute appearances – without scoring.Yet Van Marwijk confirmed Cahill was still in his plans a day after Caltex – the fuel company and main naming-rights sponsor of the Socceroos – unveiled a new marketing campaign in honour of the veteran striker.In a mocked-up image of one of the company’s petrol stations, Cahill’s face appears large on the main price billboard, the roof and one of the petrol pumps. The station has also been renamed “Cahilltex”. Five stores around Australia will take part in the promotion.When asked if FFA had given any directions to Van Marwijk over players’ selection for commercial purposes, chief executive David Gallop was firm. “Absolutely not,” he said at Sydney’s North Ryde Caltex station, one of the sites to undergo the makeover.“Have a look at Tim Cahill’s track record,” Gallop said. “He’s a guy who has produced for the Socceroos and Australia so many times. He’s going to Turkey, he’s got a few weeks of intense training and he’ll be right up there [for final selection].”Proud to be partnering with @caltexaustralia in a fun way to get behind Australian football. There are ‘Cahilltex’ stores in 5 major cities around the country and it’s awesome to have so much support for the Socceroos heading towards Russia. #Cahilltex #GoSocceroos 💚💛 pic.twitter.com/k4aXx811URShould he make the final cut, Cahill is likely to play a bench role only, but as a player who can make in instant impact with his eye for goal, he retains value to the team. In more intangible terms, his experience and ability to mentor younger players also contribute to the case for his inclusion.“Representing my country is the biggest honour I could ever have as a footballer and I’m so happy to make the 26 for the camp in Turkey pre WC2018,” Cahill wrote on Twitter. “I can’t wait to head over, join the rest of the squad and get to work. I’ll be giving it everything to make the final squad for Russia.”Other players appear on individual pumps in the mock-up, including captain Mile Jedinak, defender Trent Sainsbury and midfielder Massimo Luongo. Tomi Juric, who is ahead of Cahill in Van Marwijk’s pecking order and expected to lead the line for the Socceroos at the tournament in Russia, also features.It is not the first time Cahill has had an inanimate object named after him – in 2013, Sydney’s Cahill Expressway was renamed the Tim Cahill Expressway for 48 hours. The latest gimmick will stay in place throughout May and June, suggesting Cahill’s place in the final squad of 23 is secure. The Socceroos’ group stage campaign plays out during the month of June.In-form striker Jamie Maclaren, who scored a hat-trick for Hibernian at the weekend to take his total to eight goals in his last 13 matches, was cut from the squad, which was reduced from 32 to 26 with Tuesday’s announcement. It leaves the Socceroos short of options up front, with just Juric, Cahill and inexperienced late-bloomer Andrew Nabbout selected as strikers.Social media response to the squad and the latest gimmick was swift – and for the large part scathing. “This is actually the worst thing I have ever seen. What an absolute farce,” wrote one, while another said: “Wow I just woke up but you already ruined my day.”Ohhh.... @Tim_Cahill's inclusion in the squad makes sense now purely for this pun. #MACLARENTEX doesn't have the same ring to it... https://t.co/05jvoMNnmNThanks for costing Maclaren his spot just so you could whip this shit up. #cahillOUTSo that's why he's in the squadIn addition to the re-named service stations, Caltex also unveiled an exclusive 2018 Socceroos branded onesie, modelled by Cahill.“Set to be the comfiest piece of kit to wear while watching football this winter, the Fansie is the must-have item for Caltex Socceroos fans and sporting fans alike this year,” the official Socceroos website claimed.hey @TheWorldGame maybe someone at @CaltexAustralia can shed some light on why they made risky decision to include @Tim_Cahill in their marketing around @FIFAWorldCup ? Did someone from @FFA give them ""heads up"" about @Socceroos selections before the rest of the football family ? pic.twitter.com/e9y4eL5xfIGoalkeepers: Brad Jones, Mat Ryan, Danny VukovicDefenders: Aziz Behich, Josh Brillante, Milos Degenek, Fran Karacic, Matt Jurman, James Meredith, Mark Milligan, Josh Risdon, Trent SainsburyMidfielders: Jackson Irvine, Mile Jedinak, Massimo Luongo, Aaron Mooy, Dimitri Petratos, Tom Rogic, James TroisiForwards: Daniel Arzani, Tim Cahill, Tomi Juric, Robbie Kruse, Mat Leckie, Andrew Nabbout, Nikita Rukavytsya"

Sam Allardyce is set to leave Everton this week with the former Watford and Hull City manager Marco Silva a leading candidate to replace him.Allardyce is scheduled to meet Everton’s major shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, in the coming days and his departure is expected to be announced by the end of the week. Allardyce is six months into the 18-month contract he secured in November and oversaw an eighth-place finish in the Premier League. But fierce opposition to his management style among the club’s supporters, allied to the hierarchy’s desire for a fresh start following a dreadful season, is likely to result in the 63-year-old leaving with a final year’s pay-off of around £6m.Everton’s board will hold meetings over several key issues this week. It is also expected to hold talks with Wayne Rooney’s representative, Paul Stretford, with the former England captain seeking clarification on his Goodison future before deciding whether to accept an offer to join DC United in the MLS.Silva is the front-runner to succeed Allardyce having been Moshiri’s preferred appointment when he sacked Ronald Koeman on 23 October. Hopes of a swift transition may be complicated, however, by a legal dispute between the Portuguese coach and Watford.Watford sacked Silva in January following a run of one win in 11 matches. The club claimed in a statement that an “unwarranted approach by a Premier League rival” – Everton – led to a significant deterioration in Silva’s focus and results. The manager believed he was sacked prematurely and that he is owed six months’ salary, £750,000, and remains in legal dispute with his former employer over his settlement terms."

Jack Wilshere and Joe Hart appear to be the early casualties of Gareth Southgate’s England planning – two relatively young players who would have imagined an international future at the last World Cup.Wilshere got a chance in Brazil only once England had been eliminated, whereas Hart played in the first two games but made way for Ben Foster as Roy Hodgson rang the changes for the final match against Costa Rica. Both players went on to play in the calamitous defeat against Iceland in Nice that signalled the end of England’s Euro 2016 campaign and prompted Hodgson’s resignation, though neither is particularly tainted by the sort of tournament failure that has come to haunt teams from this country.Wilshere’s career has been bedevilled by injury, which is how he came to lose his place at Arsenal after an impressive climb through the youth ranks, and the season he spent on loan at Bournemouth after Euro 2016 could be regarded only as a qualified success. Once he was no longer integral to Arsenal plans he was no longer guaranteed an England call-up either and, if he does drop out of the reckoning for the World Cup in Russia, it will simply be the culmination of several seasons of disappointment.When Wilshere first broke through he looked so cultured and comfortable that people were talking in terms of a century of caps, or at least being a fixture on the international stage for a decade or more, which amounts to more or less the same thing.At 26, with 34 caps, it is now beginning to look as if he may not reach 50. He has undoubtedly been unlucky with the timing of some of his injuries, though it could also be said he has not always made the most of his opportunities.He has seen players such as Dele Alli, Eric Dier, Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson establish themselves through being more forceful on the pitch. In all probability Wilshere would have made it to Russia only as a squad player in any case and in that capacity his claims are now being challenged by Jesse Lingard and Ruben Loftus-Cheek.Hart’s is a completely different story. Though occasionally error‑prone with England, just as with Manchester City, the goalkeeper might still be clocking up appearances for both had not Pep Guardiola arrived and decided his distribution was not up to scratch – not just his ability with the ball at his feet inside and outside the box, but his accuracy with goalkicks and long clearances.Guardiola sets high standards for goalkeepers; he wants the complete package. Claudio Bravo, Hart’s immediate replacement at City, was hardly that – the Chilean was not in the England player’s league as a shot‑stopper – though now Ederson has been brought in with an immaculate range of goalkeeping attributes there are far fewer people arguing Hart has been harshly treated.Nonetheless the goalkeeper is at the moment looking for a club after failing to win a regular place at West Ham and not quite answering his critics when on loan at Turin the previous season.Hart has 75 caps and has just turned 31 – no age at all for a goalkeeper – yet more doors seem to be closing than opening and after very publicly failing to live up to the standards required by a succession of managers there must now be question marks over his confidence.Doubtless he could find a berth almost anywhere as a reserve goalkeeper, which is in effect what he became when on loan at West Ham, though the role does not suit everyone.If Hart wishes to continue in a first team, he may have to consider dropping down the league a little and finding a club who would be glad of his considerable experience.That might be hard to swallow for a player whose two league titles are still fresh in the memory, along with four golden glove awards from his time as No 1 at the Etihad Stadium, though it is already clear City have moved on. If Hart is to do the same, he needs to find regular football. With a bit of luck and the right club there may still be time left for a comeback."
football,"Rafael Benítez reflects on his greatest night in Istanbul and says before the final against Real Madrid on Saturday that a sixth European Cup is not beyond the Anfield club

Tue 22 May 2018 22.30 BST

Rafael Benítez has already selected the shirt he intends wearing on Saturday evening. “It’s grey,” says Newcastle United’s manager, deadpan.Considering that some of the best years of Benítez’s life have been spent representing Liverpool and Real Madrid, publicly choosing red over white, or vice versa, would represent a diplomatic gaffe to make even Boris Johnson blush.A Champions League final between the Merseyside club he so dramatically led to the trophy in 2005 and the side he grew up supporting before eventually coaching and managing, will inevitably prove highly evocative for the 58-year-old Spaniard. Benítez plans to watch events in Kiev on television at his long-established base on the Wirral. As the teams emerge, he may well reflect on the acute political tensions with, among others, Cristiano Ronaldo which prefaced his sacking at the Bernabéu early in 2016. But he will surely also relive that glorious night in Turkey 13 years ago, when he choreographed the “Miracle of Istanbul”.“I always say Istanbul will be the most emotional Champions League final ever because of the way we came back,” Benítez says, recalling that crazy evening when, at half-time, his side were 3-0 down to Milan, only to haul themselves level before winning on penalties.“Milan had [Andrea] Pirlo, they had Kaká, they were the best team in Europe but my players had great belief,” says Benítez. “We did well but Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool has more quality and value. My budget was £20m.”Yet, if the Merseysiders are hardly underdogs, neither are they clear favourites against Zinedine Zidane’s side. “Liverpool’s intensity can hurt you but Real Madrid have the experience and quality to match them,” says Benítez, who grew up in the Spanish capital. “It’ll be interesting. You’ll see a team with lots of passion and intensity and a lot of pressing and crossing and fast counter-attacking against opponents who can manage this kind of situation.“Jürgen Klopp has three players up front who can all score goals. Mo Salah has done really well but Sadio Mané and Roberto Firmino can also score against any team. We had a good balance and we also had Stevie Gerrard who could make a difference on his own. But this current Liverpool team has three players who can do that. We had one.“Liverpool can do it. They have the quality. But sometimes in these kinds of games you pay for one mistake. It’s how you manage the pressure. Real Madrid have been managing this kind of pressure for a while and Liverpool are in a new situation, so it’s a fine balance.”Istanbul changed my life in England. I went to collect my daughters from school and the other kids started singing to meWin and Klopp’s place in Anfield’s history will be assured. Confirmation that Benítez’s legacy had been cemented came during the post-match party by the Bosphorus when he rescued some invited guests struggling to bypass hotel lobby security. “A friend pointed to me and asked the security guard, ‘Do you know who he is?’”, recalls Newcastle United’s manager, laughing. When the guard shrugged indifferently, the friend declared: “This man is God.”Sheer adrenaline ensured that Benítez, virtually a teetotaller, felt no need of even a single glass of champagne that night. Surrounded by a roomful of people convinced he could walk on the Mersey, the former Real Madrid third-team midfielder partied until 6am – but two years later he saw in another, more sobering, dawn.The 2007 Champions League final in Athens featured Milan exacting revenge, beating Liverpool 2-1. “Afterwards I walked around the hotel corridors until 7am,” remembers Benítez. “They didn’t have enough rooms and my wife was sharing my room with the chief scout’s wife.“Half-time was a disaster because it was so hot. We used ice packets to reduce the players’ temperatures and there was too much sports science. I said, ‘Concentrate! We have to talk about tactics and positions.’”The Ataturk had been much milder but that 3-0 half-time deficit represented an emotional boiling point. “Everything was going wrong, massively wrong, and I had to give a motivating speech in English,” says Benítez. “My English wasn’t so good then and it wasn’t easy. My main message was that [substitute] Didi Hamann would control the middle and give freedom to Gerrard because Kaká was playing between the lines and we needed to manage the space better.“We switched to three at the back and that changed everything. We scored three goals, we matched them, we had control in extra time and we’d done a lot of work on penalties.”If Jerzy Dudek’s decisive penalty save from Andriy Shevchenko was no fluke, Benítez briefly lost control during the victory parade through Merseyside. “We were on an open-top bus, the music was very loud and it was going really fast under trees with low branches,” he recalls. “We were ducking. I had to tell the driver to slow down.“Istanbul changed my life in England but at first I didn’t realise what it meant. That happened two or three days later. I went to collect my daughters from school and the other kids started singing to me. Istanbul changed everything.”"

By the time talk turned to Antonio Conte’s future on Saturday night, the Italian’s hair was lank with champagne, silverware was acting as a shield and the mood was one of defiance. Not that Chelsea’s head coach has ever been particularly reticent when challenging his employers in public. “For sure, when you decide to take a coach like me, you must know who you are taking on, who you are charging for this job,” he said. “I cannot change my personality.”It was always likely to end this way, with Conte’s belligerent management style and Chelsea’s pursuit of something close to self-sufficiency having placed them on a collision course from the off. His two-year tenure has yielded a Premier League title and now an FA Cup and should he depart, as is anticipated, with 12 months still to run on his contract then he leaves with his stock high. His techniques have secured trophies even if, just as at Juventus, those in authority have tired of the constant grumbling and sniping en route. They, too, were never likely to change their own tack.Conte is actually due back in Italy on Monday to attend Andrea Pirlo’s testimonial at the San Siro, but he has left Chelsea with a warning to digest. He acknowledged his team had blunted, frustrated and defeated Manchester United with an ugly if admirably effective performance, a few key dashes of brilliance from Eden Hazard aside. Their victory had been forged upon the defensive displays of an excellent back three, Thibaut Courtois’ reflex saves and N’Golo Kanté’s energy in midfield once an early lead had been established. Roman Abramovich, as is widely accepted, would prefer a more expansive brand of football, more akin to that imposed upon the Premier League by Manchester City.Yet, in aspiring to achieve that, Conte fell back on his customary gripe. Emulating Pep Guardiola and co will take lavish investment. “If you ask me if we can play better then, yes, we can play better, but after this game,” he said. “For now the real situation of this club is this: we have to play strong defensively if we want to win a trophy or get a place in the Champions League. Maybe we missed the Champions League this season because we tried to play very open and, in this moment, we can’t do this, especially against a strong team.“To concede three goals in seven games it means you don’t have stability. A great team doesn’t concede three goals, or four goals against Watford.“[Playing like this] was the only way to lift a trophy. If you want to change then we can change our idea, but you must change many players. Understand? Last season, after we won the Premier League, we spoke with the club and tried to find the right way to defend our title. But, as you know, it’s not simple and sometimes you can have not always the same ambition. This season, with my staff, I have worked more than last season to overcome the difficulties. The mountain we had to climb was very high, very high, very high … but, despite this, we lifted an important trophy.”He paid tribute to the commitment of his players, even if relations with some have been strained at times. Plenty have tired of the negativity, and some of his public grumblings about recruitment policy have been construed as criticisms of those added to the ranks. Others on the staff have merely been infuriated by non-involvement.Willian was the first Chelsea player to scuttle away from Wembley on Saturday, long before his team-mates. He then chose to post a photograph of the post-match celebrations on the turf on Instagram having blocked out the head coach with three trophy emojis. Though he later deleted the post, that felt a rather needless elbow in the ribs from a player whose days at Stamford Bridge may be numbered regardless of the identity of the head coach.As the players have suggested, resolution is needed one way or the other on the managerial situation. This club cannot go into another campaign with so many cogs grinding against each other in the machine. Conte expects “a private conversation”, presumably with Marina Granovskaia, upon his return from Milan, where compensation is likely to be the main topic up for discussion, rather than planning for next term.He had shared a businesslike handshake and brief nod of the head with the influential director as he shuffled along the line of dignitaries just prior to the ticker-tape, fireworks and collective hoisting of another major trophy. “The club has the right experience to understand what they have to do in the future to be competitive, and to fight for a place in the Champions League,” he added. “And not just to win, but to win well.” He knows what he would want to stay, but it is at odds with what the board are currently able to deliver."
football,"• Experienced duo set to miss out on England’s World Cup squad• Young, Rose and Delph poised to win places in Russia

Joe Hart and Jack Wilshere are the high-profile omissions from Gareth Southgate’s England squad for the World Cup this summer after the national manager opted against selecting two of his more experienced players for the tournament in Russia.Southampton’s Ryan Bertrand is also expected to miss out when the 23-man squad is announced on Wednesday, with Danny Rose and the versatile Ashley Young preferred instead as left wing-back options. Fabian Delph, who played a significant role in Manchester City’s title‑winning campaign but has not been capped since November 2015, is poised for a surprise return to the fold.England will continue to monitor Adam Lallana’s fitness, despite his late cameo for Liverpool on the final day of the Premier League season, but are hopeful Kieran Trippier will be fit to join up despite missing Tottenham Hotspur’s last game of the season with a knee complaint. If the right-back is deemed fit, that would most likely leave Trent Alexander-Arnold on the stand‑by list. Yet it is the decision to omit Hart and Wilshere, players whose futures at their current clubs are still to be resolved, which will draw the focus.The Arsenal midfielder, named in the provisional 35-man squad submitted to Fifa this week, was told by Southgate on Tuesday that he would not be in the final 23 or list of possible replacements. Wilshere has not represented England since their elimination from Euro 2016 by Iceland in Nice but he had been picked for the friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy in March.However, the 26-year-old withdrew from the squad before they left for Amsterdam with a recurrence of tendinopathy in his knee and, having started only 12 league games this season, a historically fragile body appears to have counted against him given the demands of tournament football. Wilshere, who missed the final‑day win at Huddersfield with a knock, will now concentrate on securing his club future with his Arsenal contract to expire on 1 July.Hart was the most experienced member of Southgate’s set-up having gained his 75th and most recent cap against Brazil last November. The manager had considered him his No 1 through qualification and the autumn internationals, only for Jordan Pickford and Jack Butland to usurp him in the pecking order by starting the friendlies in March.The anticipation had been that Hart would still be included as an experienced third-choice – a role he would have been willing to fulfil – but his toils at club level appear to have prompted the management to change their mind. The 31-year-old was duly told in a phone-call with Southgate on Monday evening, with the player on an end‑of‑season trip with his West Ham team-mates, that he would not be travelling to a fifth major finals.The City goalkeeper had spent the campaign on loan at the London Stadium, where his form was indifferent. He lost his place towards the end of November to Adrián, regaining it briefly in March before high-profile errors against Burnley and Stoke, and started only 19 league games in total. His last appearance was in a 4-1 defeat at Arsenal on 22 April. Hart has no future at the Etihad Stadium and will meet City’s hierarchy to ascertain his next move.Burnley’s Nick Pope, who was called up for the games against the Netherlands and Italy but remains uncapped, is expected to travel to Repino on 12 June as third-choice, in the hope he gains from the experience as Hart did at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, after a fine year in the team at Turf Moor. His club-mate, James Tarkowski, is on the stand-by list, with Southgate able to call on John Stones, Harry Maguire, Phil Jones, Kyle Walker or Eric Dier at centre-half if required.While the inclusion of Chelsea’s Ruben Loftus-Cheek, so impressive on loan at Crystal Palace this season and on senior international debut against Germany last November, will not constitute a surprise, Delph’s recall had been unanticipated despite his claiming he was “quietly confident” of selection. The 28‑year‑old, naturally a central midfielder, has played 29 times for City this season having been successfully remodelled as a left-back by Pep Guardiola.He earned his ninth and most recent cap against Spain in November 2015 and has had to withdraw from squads through Southgate’s tenure with niggling injuries, with a knee problem forcing his withdrawal in March. “I’ve had a good season, probably shocked a few people, which has been nice,” he said. “Gareth Southgate is good at judging people and likes to see what mentality people have, and he’s well aware of my mindset.”England probable squad Goalkeepers (3) Jack Butland, Jordan Pickford, Nick Pope. Defenders (8) Gary Cahill, Kyle Walker, Kieran Trippier, John Stones, Harry Maguire, Phil Jones, Danny Rose, Ashley Young.

Motherwell’s players collect their losers medals. They look understandably disconsolate, but there’s no shame whatsoever in being outclassed by a Celtic team that’s co much wealthier than their outfit. They’ll probably think they could have offered more and that’s what will rankle.

It was easy for Celtic in the end: Motherwell just didn’t turn up and despite the Celtic’s platitudes, didn’t give a very good account of themselves. Callum McGregor scored a wonderful goal on the half-volley in the 11th minute and from that point on there was only going to be one winner. Olivier Ntcham rounded off a successful first season for Celtic with a comparatively scruffy goal on 25 minutes and Celtic continued to dominate. They took their foot off the gas in the second half and Motherwell had chances to equalise. Carl Bigirimana had the best of them, rattling the woodwork with a free-kick that came so close to frightening the life out of Celtic with 10 minutes to go.

The ball is thumped long to Moussa Dembele, who clearly has his jersey pulled by Tom Aldred as he wins, but only half-controls, the ball in the Motherwell penalty area.

47 min: Chance! Curtis Main brings a good save out of Craig Gordon after getting on the end of a pull-back from the by-line. The Celtic goalkeeper gets a strong hand to the ball and puts it out for a corner, from which nothing comes. The chance came on the back of good work down the right wing from Chris Cadden, who’s been moved further forward.

4.04pm BST
16:04

46 min: Motherwell get the ball rolling for the second half, needing to score next to have any chance of clawing their way back into this final. They started reasonably well, but were completely outclassed from the 10th minute on. Celtic get forward immediately and Kieran Tierney sends a cross towards Mooussa Dembele. Trevor Carson claims well.

15:50

It’s been men against boys for most of the first half and Celtic look home and hosed already. Callum McGregor and Olivier Ntcham got the goals against a Motherwell side that appear to have no answers whatsoever for the many difficult questions they are being posed. They’ve had a couple of half-chances without ever really threatening and seem to be resorting to bully-boy tactics in the absence of any better ideas on how to compete.Celtic won’t mind that one bit and if Motherwell get a man sent off, as seems likely, any faint hope they have of getting back in this contest will disappear down the tunnel with him.Updated

42 min: Another counter-attack from Celtic, with Dembele showing great strength to muscle his way up the centre of the pitch with Callum McGregor up in support. Dembele tries to play him through on goal, but puts too much welly on his pass and a good opportunity goes begging. Motherwell looked very stretched at the back there.

3.43pm BST
15:43

40 min: Motherwell win a free-kick about a third of the way inside the Celtic half. The ball’s played to Cadden at the edge of the penalty area, he tries to pick out Curtis Main, but the ball runs wide.

3.37pm BST
15:37

36 min: Richard Tait gets the first yellow card of the game for leaving one in on Kieran Tierney as the Celtic defender attempted a clearance. It’s been a noticable tactic from Motherwell’s players and quite a few have got spoken to about it by the referee, who has obviously run out of patience.

3.36pm BST
15:36

34 min: Olivier Ntcham did a series of acrobatic somersaults by way of celebration for his goal and looking at replay now, it’s funny to see how his team-mates were very careful to wait until he was finished before going to congratulate him.

29 min: A tip of the hat to Moussa Dembele, whose hold-up play in the lead up to Celtic’s second was outstanding. He laid it off to Ntcham, who didn’t catch the ball particularly well, but hit it accurately enough to go in the bottom corner. Motherwell defender Cedric Kipre turned his back to the ball and it clipped his heel on the way in, leaving goalkeeper Trevor Carson with no chance.

football,"Pacy, mobile left-back who gave an extra attacking drive to the England World Cup-winning team of 1966

Ray Wilson, who has died aged 83, had the lowest profile of any player in England’s 1966 World Cup final-winning team, and generally liked to keep it that way. He was a fast, skilled, mobile left-back who was capped for his country 63 times, played in every England game in the 1966 finals, and was one of the best defenders his country has produced. Yet he kept firmly out of the limelight and, unlike most of his peers, made no attempt to make a living from football after retiring from the game – preferring instead to pursue a career as an undertaker.Wilson was an important member of the 1966 World Cup team, not only for his resilient defensive qualities, his pace and his powers of recovery, but for the extra drive he gave to the attack. In the absence of true wingers, he and his right-back partner George Cohen offered the England manager Alf Ramsey some degree of speed and penetration on the flanks.Thus, in the semi-final against Portugal at Wembley, it was Wilson’s shrewd, long pass to Roger Hunt that set up England’s first goal. Costa Pereira, the Portuguese goalkeeper, raced out desperately, reaching the ball at full stretch, only to play it straight to Bobby Charlton, who promptly sent it into the net. In the final, too, undeterred by an early error when he contrived to clear the ball weakly to the feet of Helmut Haller, who drove it home to give his team the lead, Wilson was eager to join in attacks.He was one of only eight in the 1966 squad who played every match in the finals, and was on the pitch for all 570 minutes of England’s campaign. Such was his prowess that even the supremely self-assured England captain, Bobby Moore, declared that “it was a comfort to play alongside him”. Of the 37 England matches that Wilson and Cohen played together as a full-back partnership, they lost just three.Wilson had also figured in all of England’s games in the 1962 World Cup in Chile, but even he could do little against the remarkable wiles and devastating pace of Brazil’s right-winger, Garrincha, who tormented the England defence in the quarter final, which they lost 3-1.Although at 31 Wilson was the oldest member of the 1966 World Cup squad, he continued to hold off younger challengers for his England place until 1968, when he was still first choice and ever-present in his position at the European Championship in Italy as England finished in third place. However, the third-place play-off match against the USSR in that tournament proved to be Wilson’s last appearance for England, as an increasingly troublesome knee and the emergence of the young Leeds United full-back Terry Cooper combined to bring the curtain down on his international career.A Derbyshire man, born in Shirebrook, Wilson became an apprentice railwayman after school, and when Huddersfield Town signed him he was playing as a left-half. He made scant impact in that position – so much so that he was thinking about giving up the game. Called for national service in the army, he was posted to the Middle East and detested it. On his forearm he sported a tattoo that read “Egypt never again”.Once demobilised, he was bedevilled by a series of injuries, but the crucial event in his career was his translation to left-back by Huddersfield’s then manager, Bill Shankly. Having made just half a dozen league appearances in the 1955-56 season in Division Two and only 13 the season after, Wilson became a regular member of the team from 1957-58 onwards, and made his debut for England, against Scotland, as a Second Division player in 1960.In the 1964-65 season, after 266 league appearances for Huddersfield, he was transferred to First Division Everton for what was then the considerable sum of £40,000. In 1966, shortly before the World Cup finals, he was a member of the Everton team that beat Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup final. He was at Wembley again two years later in the same competition, although that final was lost to West Bromwich Albion.By 1969, after more than 100 league games for Everton, he had moved to Oldham Athletic in Division Four. But he was there for just a season. He appeared twice in the 1970-71 campaign for Bradford City, where he had a 10-match spell as caretaker manager, but then left football altogether to set up an undertaking business in Huddersfield with his father-in-law.He ran the firm until retirement in 1997 and, perhaps because of his many years in the profession, was noted for his gallows humour. When his old England colleague Cohen was struggling through a bout of cancer in later life, Wilson phoned him to ask how he was getting on. Cohen replied that he was doing just fine, but, detecting a slight air of disappointment in his friend’s voice, asked what the matter was. “Well, I was ringing to offer you a deal,” he replied.Like several other members of the victorious 1966 England team, Wilson had to wait many years before receiving any honour for his achievements, but eventually, in 2000, he was appointed MBE. In 2004 he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.He is survived by his wife, Pat, whom he married in 1956, and their two sons, Russell and Neil.• Ray Wilson, footballer, born 17 December 1934; died 16 May 2018"

Eventually, the talking stops. Jürgen Klopp and his players have done all the interviews. They have been through all the tactics and there will come a time on Saturday evening, in the bowels of the NSC Olimpiyskiy, when they will be in their dressing room, fighting their nerves and, as Klopp acknowledged, those are the moments when Real Madrid’s experience will count in favour of the 12-times champions.Liverpool’s opponents will be trying to emulate the great Ajax and Bayern Munich sides of the 1970s by winning this competition three seasons in a row, bringing their number of triumphs to 13 in total. Madrid, in Klopp’s words, “work like a clock from Switzerland” and, no matter how Liverpool have prepared for Cristiano Ronaldo, the lesson of history shows the five-times Ballon d’Or winner usually manages to leave his mark on these occasions.It also shows that Liverpool have conceded the first goal in their last three European Cup finals and, going back to that famous night in Istanbul 13 years ago, that they were behind inside the opening 60 seconds against Milan. The free-kick Djimi Traoré gave away in the buildup to Paolo Maldini’s goal was put down to stage fright on the part of the Liverpool defender. Yet it did not need long in Klopp’s company to realise he thinks the current team have too much in their favour to allow nerves to take over.“I am pretty sure in the second before the game that Real Madrid will be more confident than we are,” Klopp said, “but that is not a problem because the game doesn’t end in that second, it only starts. We’ve had two weeks to prepare and analyse. I’ve looked at the teams they have played – and they have played really strong teams. But they never played us and we are Liverpool. Not only are we a really good football team but this club has in its DNA to go for the big things. We are Liverpool. Nobody expected us to be here but we are here because we are Liverpool.The team with the most goals in the run to the final? It’s us. I can’t believe it but it’s true“The team with the most goals in the run to the final? It’s us. I can’t believe it but it’s true. We have scored the most goals and had exceptional performances. The experience they [Madrid] have is an advantage, 100%, but experience does not help you all the time. We need to make it as difficult as we can for them. We cannot try to fight on their level but tactics in football are there to bring a better opponent to your level and when they are on your level you can beat them.”Klopp is entitled to speak confidently when his side have accumulated 46 goals, if qualifiers are counted, in this season’s competition, beating the record Barcelona set with 45 in the 1999-2000 season. Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané have managed 31 between them and, in all competitions, that trio have scored 90 times. Salah alone has 44. Of course Klopp should be optimistic if his team can find the right balance between attack and defence, eliminate the mistakes that helped Roma in the semi-finals and hope that Loris Karius, their erratic goalkeeper, has an accident-free night.If they can manage all that, it is perfectly plausible Jordan Henderson can follow Emlyn Hughes (1977 and 1978), Phil Thompson (1981), Graeme Souness (1984) and Steven Gerrard (2005) by lifting the trophy.Madrid, after all, conceded 44 goals in La Liga last season and, to put that into context, it was more than Getafe in eighth position or 11th-placed Espanyol let in. That, however, does not change the fact that Zinedine Zidane’s team are always formidable opponents on the big nights or that even in this record-breaking season for Salah there is still one player, Ronaldo, who is outscoring him, 15-11, in this competition.Last season Ronaldo scored twice for Madrid when they beat Juventus 4-1 in the final. In 2016, when the opposition in the final were Atlético Madrid, his was the decisive kick in the shootout. As for 2014, facing Atlético at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Ronaldo scored again from 12 yards and la Décima was confirmed. And 2018? Nobody would be surprised if Ronaldo has his top off, flexing his pecs for the cameras, if Liverpool defend as obligingly as they did in the Europa League final against Sevilla two years ago. Or, thinking back to their performance in the Stadio Olimpico a few weeks ago, the second leg of their semi-final against Roma.Should that happen, Zidane will leave the group of 18 managers, including Brian Clough, Sir Alex Ferguson, José Mourinho and Pep Guardiola, who have won this competition twice and move alongside Carlo Ancelotti and Bob Paisley as a three-times winner. Except Zidane will have done it in less time than anybody. Which probably explains why Klopp was so nonplussed when it was put to him Zidane was not renowned for his tactical knowledge.“If a lot of people think Zinedine Zidane has not a lot of tactical knowledge and then people think the same about me that would be really funny,” Klopp said. “The two managers in the Champions League final have no clue about tactics? What would that say about the game?“For me, Zinedine Zidane is one of the best five players of all time in football. Unfortunately I have to accept that he is as brilliant [as a manager] as he was a player. I’ve been longer in Liverpool than him at Real Madrid and now he can win the Champions League for a third time. That’s never happened before.“This group of [Madrid] players work like a clock from Switzerland. I saw his team a lot of times and it is fantastic football. It is organised when it needs to be organised and chaos when it needs to be chaos. They are all world-class players but it is football and always there is an opportunity for the other team. We are proud to be here. Let’s do the best we can and let’s play.”"

Pep Guardiola has revived his interest in Riyad Mahrez, with Manchester City’s manager having continued to monitor the Leicester forward following the breakdown of a prospective deal in January.Mahrez saw a move to the Etihad Stadium collapse during the winter transfer window after the 2016 Premier League champions stated it would take a “mind-blowing offer” from City to prise him away. City were quoted a package worth around £95m, while they themselves valued the 27-year-old closer to £60m. While no formal offer was made for Mahrez, who is contracted until 2020, informal discussions between City’s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, and his opposite number, Susan Whelan, did occur.Manchester City ultimately walked away from the deal, leading to a furious and upset Mahrez effectively going on strike by failing to report for training for the next two weeks. He also handed in a formal transfer request in a bid to force through a move. That was withdrawn but there is little doubt that Mahrez would still be keen to join City were they to make another approach for him this summer.Guardiola is also intent on signing a midfielder to replace Yaya Touré following his departure from City. Napoli’s Jorginho is the manager’s principal target and it is believed he is closing in on a deal for the 26-year-old, who is valued at €60m (£52.5m) by his current employers."

Wayne Rooney will await clarification from Everton on the club’s future management before deciding whether to end his Goodison Park comeback after only one season.The 32-year-old has an offer from DC United to move to MLS in July, with the Washington club willing to give the former England captain a two‑year contract. DC United have held talks with Rooney’s representative, Paul Stretford, but are one of several overseas opportunities available to the boyhood Evertonian.Rooney’s preference is to remain at Everton where he is under contract until next summer. Everton have an option to extend his deal by a further 12 months but doubts over whether it will be activated, coupled with his reduced playing time under Sam Allardyce, have left Rooney considering a move. Everton have denied that their leading goalscorer this season has asked to leave.The former Manchester United striker has had a mixed campaign in a poor Everton side. He scored 11 goals in an impressive first half of the season, securing several important victories in the process, but his last goal came on 18 December and he has been frustrated by his deployment under Allardyce. Rooney reacted furiously to being substituted in the 57th minute of the Merseyside derby last month and he had been withdrawn at the same point against Manchester City the previous week.Rooney’s opportunities next season would appear limited under Allardyce but the 63-year-old’s future at Everton is uncertain. The striker wants clarity on Allardyce’s position, or whether he features in any new manager’s plans, before deciding whether to move with his young family to the US.Farhad Moshiri, Everton’s major shareholder, has several key issues to address beyond Rooney. Despite Allardyce’s claims to the contrary, Moshiri is expected to commence another overhaul of the club’s management structure with Marcel Brands, the technical director of the Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven, lined up for a similar role on Merseyside.Brands’s arrival would affect Steve Walsh’s position as director of football and, as well as a replacement for Allardyce, Moshiri must also appoint a successor to the departing chief executive Robert Elstone and advance plans for a new stadium at Bramley-Moore dock."

football,"Steve Cooper’s side face the Netherlands at Chesterfield with a place in the European Under-17 Championship final at stakeRyan Plant

Thu 17 May 2018 10.00 BST

The last time England met the Netherlands in a Uefa tournament on home soil, none of the England Under-17s was born. On Thursday, 22 years on from Euro 96, Steve Cooper’s youngsters will be looking to match the success of Terry Venables’ side by winning the latest in a long line of Anglo-Dutch football battles in England.Venables’ team were knocked out of Euro 96 by Germany in a semi-final shootout after Gareth Southgate missed his penalty. A year ago Cooper’s Under-17s suffered similar heartbreak; they fell to a shootout defeat by Spain in the final of the European Championship in Croatia. Twelve months on, after winning the World Cup last October, the European title is again in Cooper’s sights at the 2018 edition of the tournament held in the Midlands.A semi-final against the Netherlands at Chesterfield’s Proact Stadium on Thursday evening awaits Cooper’s players after a 2-0 victory against Norway. Kees van Wonderen’s team progressed after a penalty shootout victory against the Republic of Ireland.“It is an exciting game, England against the Netherlands, isn’t it?” said Cooper, whose team progressed from the group stage despite a defeat by Switzerland. “We must control the controllables but we will be ready – that is for sure. We knew it would be a tough game whoever we ended up playing.”Daishawn Redan scored the deciding penalty for the Netherlands past Oisin McEntee, a defender deputising in goal after James Corcoran was given a second yellow card during the shootout for, according to the referee Zbynek Proske, encroachment.Redan is a threat all too familiar to most of Cooper’s youngsters; the striker has followed up an impressive season in Chelsea’s youth teams with three goals at the tournament after scoring seven goals in five qualifiers.“We’re not just looking at the obvious individuals that will be on show,” Cooper said. “We’re looking at how our players handle the occasion, how they manage games, their decision making, their character and their personality.“Momentum is really important because it keeps our spirits going. The boys were really disappointed with themselves after the loss to Switzerland so we were really positive with them and showed them the good things that they have been doing. For them to hit the ground running against Norway says a lot about the mental space that we are in.”England’s prospects will not be helped by a trio of absentees: Arsenal’s Xavier Amaechi, the scorer of the second goal against Norway, and Manchester United’s Ethan Laird are suspended. Cooper confirmed that Thomas Doyle, of Manchester City, was ruled out by an ankle injury sustained against Switzerland, which means Huddersfield’s Matthew Dale is an almost certain starter in the centre of midfield alongside the captain, James Garner, who plays for United.One of the main qualities England possess is togetherness, according to Cooper. Speaking about Doyle, he said: “He is happy to stay around the camp. He still has a big part to play and he is a strong character, even though he will be hurting in more ways than one at the moment.“It is not my England team or any of the England coaches’ teams – it is one big group that we are all part of. There is a genuine interest in all of the teams that runs up from Justin Cochrane [Under-15s coach] right up to Gareth [Southgate] and Steve [Holland], as well as Dan Ashworth.“I know Gareth is interested in the players coming through – it is great for the players to know he is watching.”A bumper crowd is expected at Chesterfield, where England played their first game, against Israel. Cooper said: “There has been brilliant support – I am grateful to the public for coming along to support the boys. It is really important for their development; for over 5,000 people on Sunday afternoon to have turned up to Burton with Premier League games on is really fantastic.”"

Let’s start with the inevitable: following suggestions that Cristiano Ronaldo may be ready to leave Real Madrid, reports of a swap with Paris Saint-Germain for Neymar have surfaced as surely as worms after rain. You can see why such a transaction might suit all parties: PSG could relieve themselves off a burden without losing more face, Real would get a super player who might tone down his demands at a bigger club, and Ronaldo could continue scoring at an absurd rate and make daily trips to the Hall of Mirrors.If PSG could countenance losing Neymar, being forced to pull out of the deal for Kylian Mbappé would be a painful blow. But that could happen, according to new claims. Earlier this month PSG’s big cheese Nasser al-Khelaifi said the club would not consider selling the extravagantly talented young striker even for £1bn – but the thing is, he is not yet PSG’s to not sell: he spent last season with them on loan from Monaco and although PSG have an option to turn that into a permanent transfer, word is they may have to refrain from following through on that because of financial fair play restrictions. In which case Manchester City will be ready to swoop. Yay, a Qatar-funded club beaten to a player by a United Arab Emirates-funded club, that’s what financial fair play is all about!That UAE-funded club are also poised to prise Riyad Mahrez from Leicester at last, with £75m deal said to have been agreed. That’s just £15m more than City offered in January. If they’d gone the extra miles back then, maybe they’d have got that quadruple they pretended not to crave. Mind you, if they get Mbappé, Mahrez and Jorginho, the Napoli midfielder for whom negotiations are said to be advancing, then you’ll have to believe there’ll be a good chance that next season City will be able to beat Wigan Athletic.Manchester United are monitoring what is going on across town and are considering responding by making a bid for Jack Grealish. United are also sniffing around Atlético Madrid full-back Sime Vrsaljiko.Chelsea are also monitoring what is going on at City, primarily because they, too, are hoping to lure Jorginho. The west London club are also trying to prise Gonzalo Higuaín from Juventus.Chinese whispers suggest that Claudio Ranieri is close to returning to England to take charge of Leeds United, no less.And another old Premier League favourite is also being linked to a return, with Martin Skrtel said to be close to hooking up with Newcastle.West Ham, meanwhile, are being linked with the Fiorentina midfielder Milan Badelj, who has impressed the London’s club recruitments with his attractive price, being out of contract this summer.Finally, Raheem Sterling is considering having pasta with his lunch today but is waiting for the go-ahead from grubby newspaper editors."

If this turns out to be Antonio Conte’s final game as Chelsea manager – and who could really be surprised if they do part ways? – at least he has gone out on a high. For all the problems, the unending politics and the clear impression of a manager who knows his time is up, another trophy has been added to the collection. Last year, the Premier League, this season, the FA Cup; only at Chelsea, perhaps, could a manager with that return now be cut loose.It is an eccentric twist bearing in mind Chelsea have just won the eighth FA Cup of their history, moving joint third with Tottenham on the all-time list. But this can be an unorthodox club, and who can possibly say the boom-and-bust policy does not work when Chelsea, on Roman Abramovich’s watch, have accumulated so much silverware? This was the 15th trophy of the Abramovich era – and that is not even using the José Mourinho tactic of counting Community Shields.The Portuguese, in fairness, managed to get through a galling day for Manchester United without feeling it necessary to aim any gratuitous digs at his former club. Well, apart from saying it was undeserved and describing Chelsea’s tactics as “predictable”, namely by aiming the ball up to Olivier Giroud and hoping Eden Hazard could sprinkle some magic on the occasion.Predictable but effective would have been a better way of putting it and unfortunately for Mourinho his own team had nobody to menace Chelsea in the way Hazard did Phil Jones and the rest of United’s defence. Jones, in particular, looked dizzied by the experience and Hazard, with the decisive first-half penalty, chose a good day to put in one of his more illuminating performances of the past year.The same goes for Antonio Rüdiger as Chelsea defended with the stoutness that was reminiscent of Conte’s title-winning season. Gary Cahill has rediscovered his best form and, on this evidence, Chelsea’s captain might have overtaken Jones in the pecking order to start for England in the World Cup. Jones is too prone to these kind of accident-laden performances. He finished the game with a bandaged head and a sore hamstring but nothing will hurt as much as watching back the key moments, in the 21st minute, when Chelsea put themselves in a position of strength.Jones’s first mistake was to back off as Cesc Fàbregas curled the ball into Hazard’s feet. The Belgian came forward, trying to make space for himself. His first touch left Jones stranded and United were vulnerable as soon as Hazard started picking up speed, running inside his marker before shaping to shoot inside the penalty area.Conte was enraged that Jones avoided a red card for the flailing, desperate challenge that brought down Hazard. It was a clear penalty and the referee, Michael Oliver, was surrounded by Chelsea players wanting to know why Jones had not been sent off.Conte still looked incensed even after Hazard had expertly rolled the penalty past David de Gea but it was the correct decision if the referee thought Jones had made a legitimate attempt to play the ball. In that case, the regulations state referees ought to show a yellow card, regardless of whether it denies a goalscoring opportunity.After that, Chelsea had to withstand some concerted pressure, especially in the second half, when Conte’s side started to defend more deeply. A linesman’s flag denied Alexis Sánchez a close-range equaliser and Thibaut Courtois had a fine game. It would be an exaggeration, however, to depict United’s second-half improvement as a full-blown assault.The width was generally provided by United’s full-backs, Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia. Otherwise, it was a six-out-of-10 performance from the more advanced players and in the closing minutes, when an onslaught might have been expected, Chelsea were largely untroubled.Romelu Lukaku could not make any difference when he replaced Marcus Rashford in the 73rd minute and Mourinho, reflecting on a season without silverware, seemed keen afterwards to clarify that United’s leading scorer had gone to him, rather than the other way round, to say he did not feel ready to start.Rashford flickered only occasionally and it was a laboured performance from Sánchez, as it often has been since his defection from Arsenal. Hazard, on the other hand, always shimmered with menace when Chelsea looked to spring their opponents on the break.The disappointment was the lack of refinement from the two teams that finished second and fifth in the Premier League, featuring some of the more celebrated players in English football’s top division. The game hotted up in the final half an hour but, Hazard apart, it lacked any real sophistication and always had the feel of a papering‑over‑the‑cracks final. United finished 19 points behind Manchester City in the league, with Chelsea 30 adrift of the top, and nobody could have left Wembley thinking that the gulf felt like a deception.Ultimately, though, it finished with Hazard swigging from a bottle of champagne, a blizzard of ticker tape fluttering at the Chelsea end and Blue is the Colour being pumped out as the trophy was passed down the line of victorious players. Afterwards, there were all the usual questions for Conte about whether he will be leaving. If he does, there is one clear certainty – they cannot allow Hazard to follow."

Welcome to theguardian.com review of the 2017-18 Premier League season. We have nominated some contenders for this category but this is just to get the discussion going: offer your suggestions below the line …It was a pretty drab season for Evertonians but they will always remember the former England captain’s blaster against West Ham. Rooney displayed awesome control, technique and power to meet Joe Hart’s wayward clearance with a shot that zoomed into the unguarded net from inside his own half. It was even better than his effort at Upton Park in 2014, when he larruped a bouncing ball over Adrián from just inside West Ham’s half, because of how he managed to redirect the ball without even taking a touch to set himself. There are worse ways to complete a hat-trick. The Moroccan might have subsequently fallen out with Mark Hughes after a row on the training ground but he did provide Southampton with one of their most joyous moments of the season, lighting up a wretched game against a dour Tony Pulis side with a marvellous solo goal. Boufal had only been on the pitch for four minutes when he robbed Allan Nyom and set off on a slaloming dribble in which he beat several West Brom defenders before slotting the ball home from the edge of the area. Shame he doesn’t do it more often, though. He’s only scored twice this season.This was Pep Guardiola’s side at their slick best, walking the ball into the net with embarrassing ease after carving their opponents open with a moment of inspiration from Kevin de Bruyne in the 19th minute. The Belgian would later conjure a delightful assist for Leroy Sané with a beautiful diagonal centre in the second half but it was his pass to release the German earlier in the game that really underlined his eerie genius. This goal was elevated by the pre-assist from De Bruyne, who wasn’t even looking when he slipped a reverse pass through for Sané to set up Sterling. Watch the goal again and the ball doesn’t seem to be on for De Bruyne but players of his calibre spy openings that the rest of us can barely imagine. Picking one Mo Salah goal isn’t easy. The choice is extensive. Some people will have a preference for the way he wriggled through against Tottenham before lifting the ball over Hugo Lloris. It might be his bending effort in the Merseyside derby or his chip against City that takes your fancy. But for the element of surprise, how about his header against Bournemouth? The odds were against Salah when Trent Alexander-Arnold picked him out with a cross from the right yet he thought quickly, worked out the angles and lobbed Asmir Begovic brilliantly. It was clever and instinctive and a finish to show he can score any type of goal. Bournemouth’s Charlie Daniels can count himself unlucky not to have made the shortlist with his thunderous drive from a tight angle against Manchester City in August. Sorry, Charlie, but our final slot has to go to Vardy for his volley against West Brom. Mark Noble might protest after his swerving effort against Leicester earlier this month but this was the volley of the season. Riyad Mahrez’s ball from deep was judged to perfection and Vardy, who had peeled behind the West Brom defence, let it drop before whipping a left-footed shot into the bottom-left corner on the turn.

After questioning the Goodison Park postman yet again about the puzzling lack of fan mail delivered to his purpose-built, gold-initialed BS letterbox, Big Sam Allardyce went ahead with an early press conference on Friday and addressed other issues, including the prospect of Wayne Rooney upping sticks to the USA! USA!! USA!!! “I don’t get involved in transfers but there seems to be an interest from DC United,” he warbled. “My understanding is there seems to have been some negotiation along the line but as for clarity as to whether Wayne is staying or going, we’ll see later on … but let’s be clear, Wayne Rooney hasn’t asked to leave.”Whenever suggestions of Rooney going somewhere foreign have surfaced in the past, they have been accompanied by widespread, patronising t1tters suggesting this is a grown man who could not handle any kind of change of culture. The Fiver is not convinced those concerns are valid, especially this time. Admittedly, we have never heard of DC United but if, as we hope, they are affiliated to the comics, then that means Rooney will be surrounded by characters such as Two-Face, Darkseid, Sinestro, Reverse Flash and Bizarro, which doesn’t sound all that different to a Premier League dressing room.Rooney might even befriend some superhero over there with the power to reverse the ageing process, and what a happy encounter that would be for a 32-year-old with an unforgiving body. What is more, he might learn and feed back to fellow Evertonians who are unmoved by Big Sam’s football the details of the life of Bizarro, who, of course, was created with a duplicating ray by Lex Luthor to be a mirror image of Superman that Luthor could control. But things didn’t go to the villain’s plan and Bizarro came into being feeling a lot like The Fiver does on a Saturday night, wailing: “Me not human … me not creature .. me not even animal! Me unhappy! Me don’t know difference between right and wrong, good and evil!”Things got really sticky when Bizarro became infatuated with Lois Lane. Happily, Lane was quick-witted enough to use a duplicating ray on herself and create Bizarro Lois, who immediately fell in love with Bizarro. The smitten couple departed to settle down together on another planet. The lesson being, Everton fans, that there is always a mutually convenient way to end a relationship that you’re not getting any joy out of. So long as you can find a duplicating ray and/or some helpful DC characters.Join John Brewin from 7.45pm BST for hot MBM coverage of Derby County 2-1 Fulham.“When you’ve been used to playing for Arsenal for eight years, and for City for six, it’s always going to be a shock” – Istanbul Basaksehir’s Gaël Clichy gets his chat on with Will Unwin.Get your fill of Football Weekly Extraaaaaaaaaaaa.Yes, it’s our not-singing, not-dancing World Cup Fiver.

football,"In his first major interview since leaving Arsenal the manager discusses his future, not being consulted over his successor and whether Mikel Arteta has the qualities for the job

Thu 17 May 2018 20.00 BST

Arsène Wenger is finishing his breakfast in the Paris hotel where he has been coming for years and where the staff would not dream of addressing him in any other way than Monsieur Wenger, pronounced in hushed tones that convey the respect in which this grand man of world football is held in his native land.Dressed in slacks and an open-neck dark blue shirt, the man we must now refer to as the former Arsenal manager has treated himself to a mini pain aux raisins and, having finished his tea (no milk, no sugar), moved on to an espresso. In a sign that he is, perhaps, starting to let himself go just a tiny little bit, he continues spreading raspberry jam on a slice of bread (no butter) as we prepare to look back over his 22 years running one of the world’s top clubs.Typically from a man who has always been more interested in tomorrow than yesterday, Wenger begins with thoughts on his future. As we sit together for his first major interview since leaving Arsenal, the Huddersfield game – the last of his 1,235 matches in charge of the Gunners – is fresh in his mind.“It’s just too soon to know what I will do next,” he says. “I haven’t even emptied my desk yet and in a way I am still in a state of shock. I am going to give myself until June 14, the day the World Cup begins, to decide. The question is do I still want to coach, to be on the bench, or is it time to take up different functions? The one thing I can say for sure is that I will continue to work.“But do I want to continue to suffer as much? I want to continue to defend my ideas of football, that’s for sure. Spontaneously, I would say I still want to coach but I can’t really say that yet for sure.”Wenger has not stopped working for 34 years. In a time when managers are taking sabbaticals and the average span for a Premier League manager stands at less than two seasons, he has had no time off since he became the Nancy manger in 1984. With that in mind and no need, financially, to work another day, isn’t it time to put his feet up?I have friends who can go and lay on a beach all day long and I envy them. I just can’t do that. I get bored.“I have friends who can go and lay on a beach all day long for the whole of their holidays and I envy them,” he says with a grin. “I just can’t do that. I get bored. I need to be doing something. I need a challenge. I have lived and breathed football all these years and it’s a passion – I can’t imagine doing anything else. That’s why in a way this is an exciting moment for me, too. I have a new page, a blank page in front of me. As all good writers know, that can be a time of anguish but I hope I won’t have too much of that. It’s also a chance to write new chapters.”Talking football with Wenger is like having a living encyclopedia on hand. He has attended every major international tournament for as far back as he can remember and he will be at the World Cup as a pundit for beIN Sports, working for the Middle East and French channels when he is not flitting from game to game with his old friend David Dein. I have had the good fortune to accompany him on some of those travels and to work alongside him on some of those shows. Wenger is a dream for a TV host because he has a remarkable memory for games and players, an opinion on everything and often thinks differently to those around him. He is also much funnier than he might let on.During Euro 2016, for example, when he was working alongside big personalities such as Ruud Gullit, Marcel Desailly, Luis Fernández and Christian Vieri, each time I went into the green room to check on them it was invariably Wenger spinning the yarns and telling the jokes. When we finished the show each day with a football quiz, Wenger was just as competitive and playful as the other pundits, even joining celebrations with the studio audience and leading Mexican waves. In recent days the waves have been to say goodbye, and farewell. The outpourings of warmth at Arsenal but also at Old Trafford and Huddersfield moved the 68-year-old.“It was very touching to see,” Wenger says. “It has been a strange period – switching from contestation to unanimity in just a few days. Surprising, but quite nice also. I have the impression people wanted to salute my longevity, my fidelity to my club and perhaps the ideas about football I always tried to defend. I take it as a sign of recognition for the total commitment I have always had towards values I hold dearly – the desire to play dynamic, attacking football with a certain idea of how to go about it, too.“My type of loyalty probably doesn’t exist any more. Maybe the dinosaur I became was the last symbol of times that have changed. We are today in a society which is so quick to reject. There is no time to build, to construct, always this demand for results immediately. Maybe people wanted to manifest that too.“It was nice to see some of the recognition, I admit. When I arrived, you know, I was a complete unknown and I have always had the impression I am representing my country in a way. In a land where there has always been so much animosity between the English and the French I am proud to have achieved certain things and perhaps to have opened doors for other French coaches. Don’t forget, when I arrived in England a foreign manager was a very rare thing.”Although Wenger does not want to go into detail, he admits to having received many job offers. In France many imagine him as a natural fit for the Qatar-built project at Paris Saint-Germain. The club recently confirmed Thomas Tuchel as the next manager but Wenger is seen as an ideal chief executive.People are too hard on PSG, too demanding. They just won all four national trophies in France and it’s not enough“I have had no discussions with them recently, I can tell you that in all honesty,” he says. “I have always been close to those in charge of PSG – I advised them to buy the club because I was convinced there were great things that could be done in a city which loves football. They have worked well and made a good start. I think people are too hard on them, too demanding. PSG just won all four national trophies in France and it’s not enough, apparently. But you cannot build a club with the idea that if you don’t win the Champions League then it’s a failure.”Although Wenger’s advice was sought by the owners of PSG, his opinions on what should happen next at Arsenal were not solicited. Where Sir Alex Ferguson named his successor, Wenger will be a spectator of future events at the Emirates.“At least that way they can’t blame me if there are bad results in the future,” he says with a laugh. “They didn’t ask me to be involved in that process. So I will let them choose the manager and afterwards I will support him, whoever it is.”Mikel Arteta’s name has oft been cited. What does he make of that? “I don’t want to influence that decision – it’s important they make their choice in an objective way and I don’t want anything I say to be misconstrued,” Wenger says. “I know how you do these things – if I say something nice about somebody you will say I am backing him but this is not the case. For Arteta, does he have all the qualities to do the job? Yes. He was a leader and he has a good passion for the game and he knows the club well. He knows what is important at the club and he was captain of the club. So why not? But whoever they choose I will support.”Before Wenger decides his future he must return to his office and clear out his things; say a final goodbye to Arsenal. “I am an emotional man and it will be, perhaps, an emotional time but I will look around and see that life goes on. There will be youngsters training and playing and that will be a reminder of the passion I have for this game and my role as an educator. When you’re a young boy you have a dream and to fulfil that dream you need attitude and talent but you also need someone to give you a chance.“I grew up in a village and I met my first coach at the age of 19. But when I was 12, 13, 14 my dream was to meet somebody who would tell me how to play football. I was lucky – it didn’t stop me from making my life in the game but many don’t get that chance. As coaches we can change peoples’ lives, influence lives, and part of that is giving an opportunity to young players. That is one of the most beautiful things you can do.”We realise it is almost time for lunch and the French don’t mess with that. Just time for Wenger to take a photo with a young fan who tells him it’s perhaps the most beautiful day of his life, to sign the Arsenal shirt he is handed and stride off, destination unknown.

Wow, choosing the Brazil best XI of all time – that’s a tough one. There are so many brilliant players in each position, and that means some great players will miss out. My team is set up in a super offensive formation. We might concede a lot of goals, but we would score so many more. In fact, I can guarantee five goals every game!The best form of defence is to have the ball. A team with Falcão, Zico and Rivellino at its heart could play for years without making a mistake in possession. When you have the ball, you don’t have a problem. That is my philosophy in choosing my all-time Brazil XI.The goalkeeper in my special team is Cláudio Taffarel. He was so calm, smooth and peaceful, always giving us confidence on the field. He didn’t do anything fancy, never jumped or dived unnecessarily and always had the ball under control. He played three World Cups, always as Brazil’s No 1. That is not an easy achievement.My right-back is Carlos Alberto Torres. Whether defending or attacking, he was always good. Carlos was a great leader, but his technique was even more incredible. His famous goal against Italy in 1970 was such a beautiful, powerful strike.The two central defenders are Aldair and Lúcio. They never played together, but I believe that they would form an amazing partnership. Aldair was very calm, never made a bad tackle and his positioning was incredible. He was my team-mate at Roma and with the Seleção – he saved my life many times when I was attacking. Lúcio was more aggressive and intense. He scored many goals, and had a great passing range and all-round quality.Left-back, for sure, is Roberto Carlos. A world champion, he played at a high level for many years, with the same quality and intensity whether defending or attacking. He was a giant. I have never seen a shot as powerful as his. He had a missile in his leg!Midfield is the hardest area of the team to pick. There are many, many players who could play in the middle of a Brazil dream team, but I can only pick four. First, my defensive midfielder is Paulo Roberto Falcão, who starred in the 1982 World Cup. He was a smart player, a legend with an elegance rarely seen on a football pitch. The king of assists, he never misplaced a pass or made a mistake.In front of Falcão, I have chosen a ‘super trio’ of attacking midfielders. The first is Rivellino. His elastico move was beautiful, like something from another planet. I love him! He was the best dribbler of a football ever.My other two midfielders are Zico and Rivaldo. Zico was intelligent, had incredible vision and could strike a superb free-kick. A foul around the area was as good as a goal to him. As for Rivaldo, he was a genius. Come on! It was so wonderful to see him with the ball. He played with the same style as Falcão. Rivaldo was brilliant.Picking the two attackers is easy. The first is the best player of all time – Pelé. Do I need to say anything more? The athlete of the century, he scored more than 1,000 goals, and won the World Cup three times. He was complete. I don’t need to say anything more. Pelé is Pelé. No one can beat him.Pelé’s partner up front is Ronaldo. He was incredible too. You had to pay attention to both feet with Ronaldo as they were as good as each other. He was an example to other players, too. He suffered three serious injuries during his career, and was always fighting against these problems. Ronaldo was essential to us in 2002 when we became world champions. The coach for my all-time Brazil team is Mário Zagallo, the manager for the World Cup win in 1970. He would make this team play very well."

Surely football’s gods would not deny Aston Villa this time: 26 May was the 36th anniversary of the club’s European Cup victory when the team in claret and blue, against all the odds, beat the bluebloods of Bayern Munich. The number 26 was on the back of Villa’s captain, John Terry, the warrior central defender who would pass his 38th birthday back in the Premier League, taking a couple of days off when his adopted club play Chelsea to whom he said goodbye a year ago in the 26th minute.That was to be the narrative except that in the high-stakes Championship play-off final the numbers have been crunched and it is Fulham who have triumphed in the game tagged last week as the £280m match, and who will be joining the high rollers of the Premier League. Terry will almost certainly leave the club for whom he has slogged away through an endless English winter and Aston Villa’s summer will be an anxious and long one.Steve Bruce looked a shattered man on Saturday night as he tried to make sense of the club’s latest nightmare at Wembley. Bill Shankly’s old joke about football mattering more than life and death would ring hollow for a man who has lost both his parents in the space of 12 weeks this year. It would take the hardest of hearts not to feel for Villa’s manager who in 18 months has transformed a broken club and helped forge a bond between the players and supporters that had seemed fractured after Villa were relegated two years ago, swapping places in the Premier League with Bruce’s Hull City.Bruce now has the task of keeping this squad together for another assault on the Premier League. Four of the players who took to the field on Saturday, including the goalkeeper Sam Johnstone, are on loan. And if the departure of Terry is inevitable, keeping Jack Grealish at Villa Park, despite the young midfielder’s allegiance to the club, may be tricky.Grealish ran himself into the ground on Saturday evening. Rarely can a player have been fouled as much and this was like watching George Best up against a whole team of Chopper Harrises. West Brom, Stoke City and Swansea, with their enormous parachute payments after their relegation, would all love a Grealish in their side next season. Either way they will be just three sizeable road blocks to Villa as they contemplate a third season in the Championship.On Saturday Villa once more seemed a club weighed down by their history. There at Wembley were the familiar cast in the crowd: Prince William, their most high-profile fan looking worried behind his shades; Peter Withe, the scorer of that winning goal in Rotterdam 36 long years ago; even Sir Doug Ellis, the former chairman and president emeritus, now 94 and the man dubbed “Deadly Doug” by Jimmy Greaves for his penchant for sacking managers. There was another key supporter who will be crucial to the club’s future – Tony Xia, the billionaire Chinese businessman who bought Aston Villa when they were relegated after that last calamitous Premier League season two years ago.Xia’s pockets are deep but his message to supporters was not exactly a vote of confidence in his manager: “Gutted. Sorry for all fans for this difficult moment.” Bruce himself acknowledged that the next couple of weeks were crucial for restoring morale at what he called “this big club with a proud history”. The circumstances are very different but Villa’s fans will be aware that Bruce walked away from Hull two years ago because he was not given the financial backing necessary for Premier League survival. Which is why the failure to win this play-off final, in which Villa competed until the very last seconds when the substitute Scott Hogan had half a chance to head an equaliser that may have saved them from calamity, is much more costly than Villa’s last Wembley appearance three years ago when they were steamrollered by Arsenal in the FA Cup final.Fulham’s supporters were raising thousands of white flags on a muggy evening at Wembley but to Bruce and all their followers it was Villa who surrendered the initiative to a side who when it mattered showed more artistry. Tom Cairney’s well-taken goal midway through the first half may not have matched Gareth Bale’s in Kiev four hours later for style but in the £280m match it was just as priceless."

Jurgen Klopp speaks! “What the boys did is unbelievable. I can’t believe we could achieve this with Adam Lallana injured all season. The players have 9,000 games in their legs. I’m really proud of the boys. A nearly perfect season: we had no chance to challenge Manchester City so the only thing you can go for is a Champions League place.“I’m really happy for Mo. He had a little dip the last two or three weeks but today he was back at his best. It’s difficult to stay on track [when people tell you how good you are] but he’s done that. Congratulations to Manchester City. To challenge that we need more consistency and have a little more luck with injuries. “I said to the boys at half-time: if someone from outside was describing Liverpool they would say, ‘Drama’. We showed we have matured with the way we closed the game out. We will add to the squad in the summer but I’m still a big believer in developing a team. We made a big step this season and I think we can make another next season.”Updated

The Liverpool players are back on the field to enjoy a lap of honour. They went unbeaten at home all season in the league and were involved in some immense matches: the 4-3 win over Manchester City, the 2-2 draw with Spurs and that tactically compelling 0-0 draw with Manchester United.

Mo Salah’s daughter is having the time of her life, kicking the ball around Anfield to huge cheers. Her dad has long since gone down the tunnel but she’s still going strong.

Mo Salah speaks “The Golden Boot is very special. It’s always in my mind to help the team win games, and we will be in the Champions League next season so I’m very proud. It was always in my mind that I wanted to have success in England. I’m always trying to improve every year. It was very special to break the record in front of the Kop. I’ll do my best to win it next season, don’t worry.”

5.02pm BST

Mo Salah is back on the field, receiving about 48 different awards from Kenny Dalglish: Player of the Year, Golden Boot, and the rest. He has his little daughter with him, and is looking left and right to take it all in. He started the season as a Chelsea flop and ended it being routinely compared to Lionel Messi. And he seems a thoroughly nice bloke.Updated

Peep peep! Liverpool will go to Kiev in good heart after one of their easiest wins of the season. Mo Salah scored a record-breaking 32nd league goal, while Dominic Solanke and Andy Robertson added to the feelgood mood by scoring their first goals for Liverpool. Dejan Lovren was the other scorer with a towering header. Brighton were stuffed but who cares; their work for the season was done when they beat Manchester United.Updated

It’s been off the charts. From the dugout to the pitch to the stands, it’s been lovely. And to put the whole thing in perspective, it’s less than eight years since Gillett and Hicks appointed Roy Hodgson as manager. That still makes me cringe, but how far we’ve come. It shows that progress can be measured without reference to league tables. Enjoy whatever sort of off-season you’re afforded.”

A lovely moment for Dominic Solanke, who gets his first goal for Liverpool. It was made by Salah, who skilfully ignored a challenge from Dunk and then slid a perfectly weighted pass to Solanke in the area. He took the shot first time, battering a rising drive past Ryan at the near post.Updated

There may not have been much drama with regards the table, but Klopp, Guardiola and co have ensured that the league has shifted towards full-throttle entertainment and as self-contained 90-minute episodes the big matches have rarely disappointed. The City-Liverpool games in particular were superb, and the only real let-down I can recall off the top of my head was Liverpool-United at Anfield.“Compare this to a decade or so ago, when Mourinho was in his first spell at Chelsea and Rafa was at Liverpool, and 2-1 was considered a veritable goalfest in a big game. I’m sure the current situation won’t last forever, but I’m going to make sure I enjoy it while I can.”The last half hour of Liverpool v Spurs was my favourite, but as you say you could pick any number of them. For sheer drama it’s been a really memorable season in England and Europe. Probably best not to dwell on the quality of the defending or the competitiveness of the leagues, though.

Half-time chit chat“Afternoon Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “At the end of another fantastic season for the self-styled richest / best league in the world, how about a half time mention for the other end of the football scale? Was at Cowdenbeath yesterday to see the Blue Brazil extend their 113-year stretch as a Scottish league club (for another year at least) with a crazy 3-2 play off win against Highland League winners Cove Rangers. Let’s just say the Highlanders weren’t best pleased with some of the decisions and ended the game with 8 men after three red cards following a superb, old-fashioned Donnybrook in stoppage time. 1750 fans there too, more than 10 times the Fifers average home gate. To see them celebrating being confirmed as officially the worst team in Scotland for the second year running was a sight to behold. As important to them as top four places, Europe, 17th place and Champions League finals to Premiership clubs.”Oh man, that sounds wonderful in just about every way.

Glad to see Salah break the record, top four should be comfortably secured (other scorelines looking particularly tasty), so should be ending on a high. I’d like to see a goal for Big Dom, Maybe one for Ings off the bench, and a second half cameo full of flicks and spins from Lallana. And then on to two weeks of nerves/crippling fear...”

football,"• Grealish had to deal with toxic dressing room, adds Bruce• Villa lead Boro 1-0 from Championship play-off first leg
Louise Taylor

Until recently Jack Grealish was routinely pigeon-holed as a self-destructive, troubled talent but Steve Bruce believes his playmaker was merely a victim of Aston Villa’s once noxious dressing-room culture.If there is no reason to doubt the Villa manager’s assessment, Grealish also seems to have done an awful lot of growing up. The 22-year-old would – if Villa go up – return to the Premier League as an infinitely more mature version of the midfielder who once drove managers to distraction.Grealish hopes his top-tier comeback will be with Villa in August but first Bruce’s side must beat Middlesbrough in Tuesday night’s Championship play-off semi-final at Villa Park and then win the Wembley final.An outstanding performance by Grealish at the Riverside on Saturday helped Villa secure a 1-0 first-leg lead, with Mile Jedinak’s winner headed home from one of his corners.“Hopefully I can get man of the match again at Villa Park,” Grealish said. “It’s a massive game but we’ll try not to let the occasion get to us. I’ve played in some big games but this could be one of the biggest. It’s about getting back to the Premier League, where this club belongs. I’m going to relish it. These are the games you live for.“We’re going into it with great confidence but it’s only half-time, the score’s only 1-0 and we know Middlesbrough have players who can hurt you.”Bruce, attempting to mastermind his fifth promotion to the top flight as a manager, believes Grealish was damaged by a Villa dressing-room culture now erased by his introduction of high-calibre senior professionals including John Terry, Robert Snodgrass and Jedinak.“It wasn’t just on the pitch that I needed John Terry,” Bruce said. “It was to deal with a dressing room that had been toxic for years. It was important Jack Grealish could see a top pro like Terry and think: ‘This is how you do it.’ By the time Jack was 21 he had had seven different managers all telling him different bullshit. He needed stability and focus.”So, too, did Adama Traoré. Another victim of the hidden chaos as Villa plunged out of the Premier League two years ago, the former Barcelona winger was swiftly offloaded but is now the star of Tony Pulis’s Boro squad.“Adama gets kicked all the time because he’s such a good player,” Grealish said. “I always got on really well with him at Villa and I still speak to him. Since Tony Pulis has been manager at Middlesbrough he’s really taken to him and Adama has taken to Pulis. I’m really happy for him.“We’re not going out to kick Adama but you’ve got to be wary of him. He’s that fast you need more than one or two players on him. He could still win the tie for Middlesbrough and I’m sure he’s desperate to do that against his old club. We’ll be working hard to make sure that doesn’t happen.”Traoré was well shackled in the first leg by Villa’s Alan Hutton who, significantly, swapped from left-back to right-back when Pulis ordered his winger to switch flanks.The 33-year-old Hutton, deputising for Villa’s hamstrung first choice left-back, Neil Taylor, will have to repeat the feat on Tuesday night when Boro’s teamsheet could be intriguing. Pulis must decide whether to start Patrick Bamford ahead of Britt Assombalonga, who missed some decent chances on Saturday, in attack or even, unusually, select both strikers.“It’s going to be a proper football match in a great stadium at a great club with 48,000 people there,” said Boro’s manager before applying a touch of gamesmanship. “Occasions like this are why we’re all in football but I think the pressure’s all on Villa – they’re expected to go through. You never know, though, we could end up beating them on penalties.”"

The North American bid team for the 2026 World Cup has defended the right of four US-governed territories to vote for the host of the tournament after a complaint was made to Fifa that it was a clear conflict of interest.The Fifa hierarchy, including president Gianni Infantino, are widely thought to favour the joint bid from the US, Mexico and Canada. It is understood members of the Morocco delegation privately believe that football’s governing body has repeatedly moved the goalposts with regard to the bidding regulations in an effort to derail their campaign. The Morocco 2026 team has also written to Fifa to complain that the US territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the US Virgin Islands should not retain a vote but it has not yet received a response.The North American bid denied it has gained an unfair advantage amid suggestions of underhand tactics employed by Fifa.There are 211 Fifa member federations but only 207 of those are eligible to vote, with bidding nations excluded. But Fifa puts the onus on the federations themselves to declare a conflict of interest and none of the four American-governed territories has done so. In a statement issued to the Guardian, a Fifa spokesman said all member associations are entitled to “participate and vote” at the congress in Moscow in June, providing they do not have a conflict of interest, as laid out in the bidding regulations issued in October.According to article 4.2 of those rules, a delegate with a conflict of interest “shall decline to participate in the voting process” for the 2026 World Cup. It adds that the delegate “shall notify the Fifa general secretariat immediately” of a conflict of interest.A spokesman for the North American bid told the Guardian: “Fifa is organised around soccer federations and that’s what allows you to vote. This is not who’s under the reach of the Queen or who’s a former French colonial authority. This is who has a soccer federation. The Faroe Islands has a soccer federation, Iran has a soccer federation and that’s what this is about, a soccer tournament. This is not the United Nations.”It is understood there were also concerns in the Morocco camp about changes made to the bid regulations just 48 hours before final versions were due to be submitted in March. The revised rules stated, among other things, that the maximum drive between a host city and the nearest airport was reduced to 90 minutes when the journey between El Jadida, on Morocco’s west coast, to Casablanca airport had been estimated at 91 minutes.The revised rules also place an increased emphasis on ready-built stadiums, which the United bid has. Morocco, on the other hand, would need to build nine new venues. But the North American bid rejected the suggestion of underhand tactics.“If you compare to previous bids, Fifa passed the 2.0 reforms and clearly put an emphasis this time on their desire to use already constructed facilities,” a spokesman for the bid said. “We’ve seen the problems with white elephants in Brazil and South Africa and Russia and Qatar. One of the distinguishing factors of our bid was to have already constructed stadiums.“It’s unfortunate if your bid is reliant on building new stadiums. But we have been subject to the same amount of scrutiny. The Fifa inspection taskforce toured four cities in North America and looked at everything. They’ve been transparent and open. You may not like how the rules of the campaign impact on your candidacy but those are the rules. I don’t like challenges to the Fifa process because it suggests we are back in the old days and Fifa has gone to a great extent to make sure that is not the case.”Morocco were also understood to take a dim view of the involvement of Donald Trump in the race when Fifa rules strictly outlaw political interference. Trump tweeted: “The US has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada & Mexico for the 2026 World Cup. It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the United Nations)?”The former France international Lilian Thuram, who is a supporter of the Morocco 2026 bid, said: “When I think about what the sport should bring to our children it’s abiding by the rules, to play fair … Donald Trump is not on this path. I think that he’s driven by a ‘power game’.“He believes in using power to bully and that the strongest can dominate the weaker and the richest can despise the poor,” Thuram, who is the most capped player in French football history, added. “What we need to understand is that his behaviour, with what he is saying and doing he thinks he is helping the bid. He is trying again to impose his views.Thuram held an an imaginary gun to his head as he continued: “It’s a power play and that’s why I think it’s important to pick people who play by the rules of the game. It’s important to raise our children to think you go with the people who play by the rules of the game, otherwise they will grow up thinking the strongest is always right.” Martha Kelner’s trip to Morocco was paid for by the Morocco 2026 bid team"

Despite doing everything to show that he is a man for the big occasion in helping his team reach a third successive Champions League final, Real Madrid are continuing their seemingly never-ending search for Keylor Navas’s replacement by switching their sights to Thibaut Courtois.All is not well at Stamford Bridge after Newcastle and Huddersfield condemned Chelsea to Thursday night football next season and the Belgian could be one of the first out of the door this summer. He has only a year left on his contract having stalled on signing a new deal worth £200,000 a week and has always said he intends to return to the Spanish capital at some point in his career having spent three years on loan at Atlético Madrid. With Manchester United digging their heels in over David de Gea, Courtois is seen as the next best thing and could therefore be on his way to Spain.Speaking of Manchester United, Albania international Elseid Hysaj is a target for José Mourinho. The Napoli man has a £44m release clause – a figure described as “quite modest for a full back” – and could therefore be on his way to Old Trafford to replacing the ageing Antonio Valencia.PSG’s Thomas Meunier is an alternative, presumably for quite a lot less. It’s going to be a busy summer by the looks of things in Manchester because Mourinho is also eyeing up a move for Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder Fred, who has a £53m release clause. Pep Guardiola has been linked to the Brazil international in the past and PSG have now entered the fray as well. In promising news for Newcastle fans, it seems Rafael Benítez has held talks with PSG goalkeeper Alphonse Areola over a potential move, perhaps signalling that he may still be there in August. Italian media is reporting the Spaniish manager has already turned down an approach from Napoli because he is negotiating a new contract on Tyneside. Down in south London, a former Newcastle player could be set to stay a little longer if things all go to plan. Yohan Cabaye has played his part in Crystal Palace’s strong end to the season and could now be persuaded to sign a new deal on reduced terms. His future and that of Wilfried Zaha, who has once again been attracting the attention of Manchester City, may take a while longer to be resolved. Fresh from their own feat of escapology, Southampton are already casting the net far and wide and could end up landing Denmark forward Pione Sisto if they are prepared to pay his £36m release clause to Celta Vigo. Sofiane Boufal could be on his way, however, after his fallout with Mark Hughes. The Morocco forward has admitted he wants to return to France tout suite."

Welcome to theguardian.com review of the 2017-18 Premier League season. We have nominated some contenders for this category but this is just to get the discussion going: offer your suggestions below the line …Jesé – whose brilliant season-opening, match-winning debut against Arsenal predated months of mediocrity or complete invisibility – disappeared after being allowed to go back to Spain to care for his sick son, whose mother then accused him on Instagram of skipping hospital and spending time instead in a Madrid nightclub, “smoking, drinking and [enjoying the company of another woman] in the bathroom”. Goalless Saido Berahino arrived late for an Under-23 game and was fined and relegated to the reserves. Erik Pieters was fined two weeks’ wages for ignoring a club curfew to go to a nightclub the night before a match. Ibrahim Afellay’s attitude in training was so dismal Paul Lambert told him to stop turning up. After Stoke’s relegation was confirmed Jack Butland said their transfer dealings had been “farcical”, while Charlie Adam said “some players have been getting away with murder for a long time”. The cumulative effect of these stories was to suggest that part of the squad had experienced a total breakdown in discipline, while the remainder watched them and simmered with resentment.Future employers will want to consider this period of their careers very carefully, assuming they – unlike Stoke, it seems – do any due diligence at all.Any number of Arsenal players might have appeared here – Shkodran Mustafi and Granit Xhaka have been largely terrible; the once-reliable Petr Cech tops the table of mistakes that have led to goals in the top flight this season with six; Alex Iwobi’s best performance of the season came in a Nike advert. So many players have underperformed that the only reasonable conclusion is to blame the manager, sentiment be damned. Wenger’s golden years were sufficiently impressive to allow him still to be considered something of a great as he departs this summer, but he has spent the last few years trashing his reputation and this was the only thing that, as the end reared into sight, he was still getting better at.“You see how quickly your profile can change in the Premier League, it changes dramatically,” said Pardew when he was appointed West Brom manager in November. “I look at Sean Dyche now, his profile is really high and he’s doing superbly, and mine isn’t at the moment. I’ve just walked into a club so I need to get my flag up the pole.” He proceeded to remove his flag entirely, then tear it into ribbons and burn it, producing ashes so radioactive the urn had to be lined with lead before he buried it extraordinarily deep in an astonishingly remote location. Eighteen games and eight points later it was almost – if not, given Pardew’s apparently brilliantly-honed chairman-seducing interview patter, entirely – certain that Pardew’s flag would never see the pole again.Of all the striking failures in the Premier League this season, from Álvaro Morata to Andre Gray, one stands alone in a personal field of haplessness. Benteke made 31 Premier League appearances, had 60 shots, of which one in three (21 in total) was on target and one in 20 (three) went in. As conversion rates go, this is ugly. Bakary Sako scored as many for Palace, and only started two matches and has been injured since January. Benteke has always been a feast-or-famine striker, but even for him this season has been barren. It’s not as if his all-round contribution has made up for his lack of end product: only eight players in the Premier League hit more inaccurate short passes than Benteke. Benteke attempted 672 passes, 44% of which went astray.“Players who dive or feign injury could face a two-match suspension starting from this season,” read the Premier League’s announcement last August. “Footage from the weekend’s fixtures will be reviewed each Monday and any player found guilty of simulation will be banned.” But the promise of a fakery-free future never materialised: Everton’s Oumar Niasse was the only player to be punished, in November, while the season was as ever scattered with simulation-inspired strife. The rule change should in time come to be seen as a step in the right direction, but only once the people charged with enforcing it stop looking in the wrong direction."

Karachi is the capital of the province of Sindh, the most populous city in Pakistan and among the biggest in the world. Bordering the Arabian Sea, it is home to more than 21 million people.Here football is the opiate of the people. It comes as no surprise that Hajra Khan first played outside her home with other children, keeping goal in a net chalked out against a neighbouring wall. However, it was not until she was 14, preoccupied with basketball and track and field, that her mother came across football tryouts in the local Sunday paper and told her to give it a shot.Ten years on, Khan’s talent has forced football to transcend the country’s historically rigid gender norms and has proved to be a vehicle for change. Khan was made captain of the Pakistan women’s team at the age of 20. She is the country’s highest-scoring female footballer, a Unicef ambassador and the first Pakistani player, male or female, to be signed by a foreign club.As a child Khan was quiet but she has been anything but when it comes to her national team’s struggle for equality. At the most recent training camp the women were paid $3 a day to the men’s $10. “Dentists, economists, engineers and school girls quit their livelihoods just to be at that camp, a camp that pays a quarter of what they were earning,” Khan says.Demands from the women’s team for more appear to have had an impact. It was announced in April that the wage would be increased to $10 a day – although the men’s pay was doubled to $20. Khan’s fight is part of a global picture, with female footballers across the US, Norway, Brazil, Ireland and most recently New Zealand demanding gender parity.We realised everyone was paid unfairly, treated poorly, and figured the only way to make this work was to work togetherThough there is no ignoring the signs of progress in Pakistan, with a historic transgender rights bill passed this month, sexism is pervasive in the Islamic country – which gained notoriety for arguably being one of the most oppressive countries for women, ranking second-worst on the Global Gender Gap index. Men’s teams are not only paid more but granted priority in pitch bookings over women’s teams, who then have to train on cricket pitches or any surface that suffices. And the problems run deeper.“Say if there’s a photo with the national team on Facebook, there’s going to be 100 negative comments about how she’s not Muslim, how she’s a disgrace to the country,” Khan says. “They don’t care of the skill that the girl has, or the credibility that she holds, or that she’s representing the national team.”In an attempt to improve football in Pakistan, Khan has spent the past few months organising international friendlies and local matches to keep the team active, despite the absence of structural support and a lack of Fifa affiliation, which means they cannot be officially labelled a national side. It is uncertain whether they will be able to participate in the Asian Games, which begin in Indonesia in August.Khan has travelled for trials in Germany with the Bundesliga clubs SGS Essen, FSV Guterslohand and VFL Sindelfingen, appeared in Coca‑Cola advertisements and played in the Maldives National Women’s League but is still assailed with remarks about female fragility and doubts about how a woman could pursue a “man’s game”. Her reply? “If your son can play it, I sure as hell can play better than he can.”Shattering this stereotypical mindset is not straightforward but Khan did recently break a world record: she played the world’s lowest-altitude football match on the shores of Jordan’s Dead Sea, 420m below sea level. The event, organised by Equal Playing Field, a non-profit organisation pushing to end gender inequality in sport, brought together women of 29 nationalities. They hiked through the desert mountains, organised football clinics in local towns and played the record‑breaking match – in which Khan scored the winning goal despite having a broken toe from parading around the Seven Pillars of Wisdom hours earlier.“We spoke about how things work in our country and how each of us has struggled to make a mark whether in our sport or in the work that we’re doing,” Khan says. “And we realised that everyone was paid unfairly, treated poorly, and we kind of figured the only way to make this work was to work together for our cause and raise awareness.”While Khan finishes her degree in international relations from the London School of Economics, she is dreaming of creating an NGO to combat the stigma of mental illness among professional athletes and starting an academy to provide girls with direction from a younger age.We speak just after she has returned home from giving her first TED talk in Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, focused on athletes and mental health. She opened up about her clinical depression in an attempt to destigmatise mental illness among professional athletes.“When an athlete gets physically injured, there’s doctors, physiotherapists, everyone’s trying to work on their recovery so the player can get back on the field as fit as possible, but when it comes to their health issues, the treatment is not the same,” Khan says pointedly. “If you have some sort of illness, you’re portrayed as weak and as athletes we’re not supposed to be weak; it’s a complete antithesis of what athletes are supposed to be.”Khan feels there is a lack of female role models and managers. To encourage more girls to play, and in the hope of serving as a mentor Khan has visited players’ houses to convince parents of their daughters’ talents and offer support. “I feel like it’s changing,” she says. “Slowly, but it’s definitely changing.”Change came most recently in Peshawar, in northern Pakistan, with announcements of a first transgender sports league. When she heard the news, Khan beamed with happiness. She plans to contact the league and expand it to other cities.“I have great friends in the transgender community who are fighting the cause day and night. I think football can make a big difference if we work together.”"

It’s been a tough week for the flamin’ bosseroos of Football Federation Australia (FFA), who’ve had to interrupt brunch at least once in order to intimate that critics can rack off. Those critics got all obstreperous on Tuesday when it was announced that Tim Cahill is part of the country’s pre-Ethics World Cup training squad. The player has been terrific in the past but he’s 78 years old now and his recent preparations for the World Cup have involved studying Steve Morison’s galumphing technique from a bleak observation post on Millwall’s bench. Which is why many fans couldn’t help wondering whether Cahill’s inclusion in their 26-man squad was in any way connected to the fact that he was revealed on Monday as the figurehead of an expensive marketing campaign run by a fuel company that happens to be the main sponsor of Australia’s proud and totally sacrosanct national team, the Caltex Socceroos.There were also fears, at least from a Fiver standpoint, that those suggestions would lead to another press conference in which Australian sporting leaders break down in tears and whimper for forgiveness like children who’ve soiled their pants in the supermarket. Happily, there was no such spectacle this time, as the FFA came out fighting, insisting commercial interests have in no way led to shameless compromises being foisted upon the team’s manager, Bert Coca-Col … sorry, Bert van Marwijk. “Absolutely not!” stormed FFA supremo David Gallop from the forecourt of one of the Caltex stations that is to be renamed ‘Cahilltex’ for the duration of the World Cup. “Have a look at Tim Cahill’s track record,” ordered Gallop, a keen archaeologist.“He’s a guy who has produced for the Socceroos and Australia so many times!” continued Gallop, who may have had the verbal trots. “He’s going to [the training camp in] Turkey, he’s got a few weeks of intense training and he’ll be right up there [with a chance of being included in the final 23 and then amazing the watching world in his daring new role as the Australian Roger Milla].” Jamie Maclaren, the striker jilted from the squad despite scoring a hat-trick for Hibs last weekend, was not immediately available for comment. But Cahill was. “There are ‘Cahilltex’ stores in five major cities around the country and it’s awesome to have so much support for the Socceroos heading towards Russia,” tweeted a player whose mouth, at least, is not running on empty.30 March: “This is a proof that Saudi sport is doing well … I expected to be at the World Cup as I have already refereed in key Asian and international competitions, and I know that Fifa always look at the quality of referees and their previous performances, so I knew they would be fair in their selection” – referee Fahad Al-Mirdasi on his selection to officiate in Russia.16 May: “Fifa notes the information that referee Fahad Al-Mirdasi has allegedly been banned from all football-related activities by the Saudi Arabian Football Federation” – Al-Mirdasi is banned for life after offering to fix the King’s Cup final between Al-Ittihad and Al-Faisaly.Producing the Guardian’s thoughtful, in-depth journalism – the stuff not normally found in these emails, obviously – is expensive, but supporting us isn’t.

A heartwarming way to finish. You have to feel for Exeter, a great club that have done wonders, but it’s a very good news story for Coventry – they deserved it with a fine second-half performance on the day, and their long-suffering fans have more than earned a moment like this. The celebrations will go on a long time.Here’s our match report, courtesy of Ben Fisher. Enjoy, and go and rest yourselves for a few days before the World Cup buildup begins in earnest!Updated

McNulty, the correctly-appointed man of the match, has a word: “You go through a lot more bad days than good days and it’s worth it, these days are worth all the bad days. We’ve been up and down all season and it’s been frustrating but days like today ... I took quite a lot of stick at the start of the season but it’s part and parcel of football and I know it would turn at some point. Today was special.“There’ve been a lot of problems with the owners and fans staying way for whatever reason, but now we’re back in League One it’d be great for them to come back and support the boys.”

5.11pm BST

What now for Exeter after two Wembley defeats in successive years? Surely Tisdale will leave; Steve Perryman, their director of football, will too. It will have to be a new era for them and they’ll need to manage it well – without sounding patronising, a club of that size needs exceptional people.

Now Coventry lift the trophy! Golden glitter showers them. Half of Wembley is empty now, the other half is jubilant. They’ve needed a day like this.Updated

“I have no affiliation to Coventry, but their 1987 FA Cup victory is the first game I can remember watching on the TV,” hearkens Shaun Wilkinson. “Their slide has been very sad, and seeing this today has cheered me right up. Congrats Coventry! Now they need to strengthen their squad. Is Micky Gynn still playing?”

4.59pm BST
16:59

Robins speaks, briefly: “We need backing again now, let’s not rest on our laurels. It’s amazing, I can’t give enough credit to everybody.”Willis: “It means everything, to come back and do it [get up] first time I’m buzzing. I’m not scored many and that was definitely up there. Hopefully next season we can push on again.”Grimmer: “You can’t ask the supporters to come out in more numbers than they have. This experience is something I’ll remember forever. I went in and Sparky [McNulty] laid it off to me, I thought I’d shape it towards the back stick and it went into the far corner.”Updated

Stockley laces one a whisker wide for Exeter and then ... that’s it! Coventry done it with a 3-1 win and it’s richly deserved on the day – after some dark, dark years, a huge ray of light!

4.51pm BST
16:51

90+3 min: No, I don’t think so. Burge claims a ball forwards and Coventry are going to be more than OK here.

4.49pm BST
16:49

90+1 min: Five minutes of added time. They couldn’t ... could they?

4.49pm BST
16:49

It won’t count for much but it’s another superb strike for our afternoon and it comes from the substitute winger Edwards – whose introduction I missed, sorry – who dances inside from the left and fairly lashes one into the far corner. Lovely stuff from him but if only Exeter had shown something remotely like that earlier.

4.46pm BST
16:46

88 min: And if you wonder why the Coventry fans are so full of song, here’s why: it’s their first promotion since 1967! They’ve had this saved up!

4.45pm BST
16:45

87 min: It was Grimmer, of course, who scored a fantastic winner against Stoke in the FA Cup. Coventry played some fine stuff in that run and have done so again today. If – and it’s a massive “if” – they can keep this side together, who could rule out a tilt at another promotion?

4.43pm BST
16:43

84 min: Storey loops a header well wide. This game, in particular, has gone.

4.41pm BST
16:41

82 min: Off the post from Jay! That’s Exeter’s best moment as the substitute sets his sights just outside the area, lets fly and clips the outside of the frame. That might have made it interesting. Instead, Coventry are emboldened to bring off the game’s best player, Marvellous Marc McNulty, and bring on Ponticelli.Updated
at 4.41pm BST


4.37pm BST
16:37

79 min: Bayliss weaves into the area, hoping to join the list of great goals, but Pym reacts very well to keep his deflected effort out. Exeter survive the corner. If anyone’s going to score the next goal I don’t think it’ll be Exeter.Updated
at 4.38pm BST


4.36pm BST
16:36

78 min: Exeter are pushing, but don’t really seem to have any belief and Coventry are happy to commit men forward on the counter. It’s been a blistering second half from the Sky Blues, it really has.

4.34pm BST
16:34

75 min: Harley has what is Exeter’s best effort by miles, swirling in a right-footer from 25 yards that Burge has to fingertip round the post.

4.33pm BST
16:33

74 min: “Torn on this one,” writes Kevin Wilson. As nice as it is to see Coventry make their way back, I’m still unhappy with the part they played in Barnet’s relegation!”Yes, if they’d played this well against Morecambe on the final day ...

4.32pm BST
16:32

73 min: Another word for McNulty, who has been so much more than an out-and-out striker today constantly running the channels, playing with his head up and bucketloads of intelligence. His two assists reflect that. Exeter threaten with a far-post header that goes across goal, about as close as anything they’ve produced. Then Coventry replace Shipley with Kyel Reid.

4.30pm BST
16:30

72 min: Coventry’s owner, Joy Seppala, smiles from her place in the stands. I’m not sure the fans’ delight will necessarily include her but let’s hope this is the start of better days for them.

4.28pm BST
16:28

Oh, that is a lovely goal! They’ve scored some belters here! Coventry are heading to League One and this came after a ball from Bayliss into McNulty, who then lays the ball back to the right-back Grimmer, who curls an absolutely picture-perfect shot up and over Pym. That was a beautiful move from Coventry, all slick passing and movement to create space for each other, and an absolutely top-class finish.Updated
at 4.39pm BST


4.26pm BST
16:26

68 min: That’s a bit better, a sweeping move giving Sweeney a chance to cross, but nobody attacks it and Burge leaps to catch.

4.24pm BST
16:24

66 min: Coventry can sit off a little now, knowing they have legs on the counter and that Exeter seem capable of offering next to nothing.

4.23pm BST
16:23

38 - Marc McNulty has been directly involved in 38 goals in all competitions this season (28 goals, 10 assists) – 24 more than any other Coventry City player. Phenomenal. pic.twitter.com/WvEqmdFInTNot bad! He’s been very good today.

4.21pm BST
16:21

63 min: Now it does go out and off goes Woodman, replaced by James. We also see Jay replace Moxey. All change on the left side, basically.

4.20pm BST
16:20

62 min: Exeter have wanted to make a double sub for a long time now but the ball won’t go out. They need to shake things up badly, there is no pace or spark out there.

4.19pm BST
16:19

60 min: ... which is also defended well, so well that Coventry can break in numbers and Shipley, with men over, drills one from 30 yards that Pym has to fingertip wide!Updated
at 4.19pm BST


4.18pm BST
16:18

59 min: Exeter earn a right-sided corner. It’s handy from Boateng, aimed dangerously towards the back stick, and defended well for another ...

4.15pm BST
16:15

56 min: As things stand you’d think Exeter are going to kick themselves for, to all intents and purposes, not turning up here. Coventry came out blazing for the second half and it’s probably won them the game!

4.14pm BST
16:14

They don’t have as much as Coventry! Now Exeter have a mountain to climb as McNulty, holding off a defender, surges into open space and plays a perfectly-weighted ball left to Shipley, whose left-footed shot deflects cruelly off a defender and loops agonisingly over a despairing Pym. Most of Wembley goes berserk! They have one and a half feet in League One.Updated
at 4.32pm BST


4.11pm BST
16:11

53 min: The game needed that goal, and will surely open right up now. What have Exeter got?

4.10pm BST
16:10

52 min: It was Doyle’s pass to Willis, and the finish was just everything you’d dream of at Wembley. It should soften some of the disappointment for Biamou, who has injured something and has to go off now, replaced by Clarke-Harris.

4.08pm BST
16:08

And that is *much* more like it! It comes from the centre-half Willis, and what a strike! He stays upfield as Coventry try and get things going again following that cleared corner, takes a sharp pass to feet 22 yards out, spins and whips a wonderful shot up and around Pym into the far corner. A goal from absolutely nothing, and from the least likely of players. Game on!Updated
at 4.15pm BST


4.07pm BST
16:07

48 min: It’s Coventry who start the sharper, Bayliss and McNulty just waiting to link up the first time and then, on the second occasion, Bayliss cutting back for McNulty to see a drive batted round the post by Pym. The corner comes to nought. More like it though!

4.04pm BST
16:04

Right then ...

4.03pm BST
16:03

Another Coventry legend is watching keenly:A massive GOOD LUCK To @Coventry_City today down at Wembley..... Make this the start of the RETURN of The Sky Blues! You fans deserve something back,after years of being overlooked!! #PUSB#DoItForCyrille pic.twitter.com/oQoUdhqTrW

4.01pm BST
16:01

Back underway shortly. I think somebody will cut loose and win this in normal time. Can’t look too far beyond Coventry, for who McNulty is a real livewire, if they up the pace. But if Exeter can play a bit more effectively off Stockley they’ll threaten too.

3.48pm BST
15:48

Both sides had spells on top, and Coventry have certainly looked the more threatening when they get it together, but that was a forgettable half on a humid Wembley afternoon. I’m fairly sure it’ll get better. I am!

3.47pm BST
15:47

45+2 min: Shipley now plays a nice give-and-go with McNulty but can’t quite work the angle and his shot is blocked by Moore-Taylor. As the half comes to a close Coventry have found something close to their earlier rhythm.Updated
at 3.47pm BST


3.45pm BST
15:45

45 min: And as we hit 45 minutes a first real combination from the Coventry strike pair, Biamou heading down astutely for McNulty to slice over with a defender in close attendance.Updated
at 3.46pm BST


3.44pm BST
15:44

44 min: Now it’s Storey with his second last-ditch challenge of the game, making a vital interception to stop a Doyle ball through to McNulty from reaching its man. Exeter wanted an offside but McNulty’s movement really is very clever at times.

3.43pm BST
15:43

43 min: Hyam, the Coventry defender, stretches to boot a right-wing cross away. Boateng has grown in stature for Exeter during the half and is quite dominant in midfield at the moment.

3.41pm BST
15:41

41 min: Can’t really mess around with this: nothing very interesting is happening in this game at all. It’s safe to say both sides are pacing themselves in the heat, and I’m pretty sure we will see a much livelier second half. Woodman’s cross bounces away from Stockley as Exeter try and make me look even sillier than usual.

3.37pm BST
15:37

38 min: Biamou, McNulty’s strike partner, is down – collapsing very softly indeed after running up against .... I think ... Storey. He gets up, and now seems OK.

3.36pm BST
15:36

36 min: It’s definitely fair to say Coventry’s head of steam has spluttered out, and we can easily trace that back to Stokes’s brief absence.

3.34pm BST
15:34

35 min: Replays suggest Coventry’s Michael Doyle elbowed Jake Taylor during an Exeter attack a few minutes ago. Nada from the officials. Was Doyle lucky not to be shown a card of some colour?

3.33pm BST
15:33

33 min: Stockley is now causing a few problems and another flick-on allows a cross to come in from wide, although again it’s not particularly threatening. At the other end Shipley warms Pym’s palms with a strike from the edge of the area.

3.31pm BST
15:31

31 min: Exeter definitely seem to have pushed up a yard or two since that little injury break. A long daisycutter from ... I admit I didn’t see who ... is gathered by Burge and now the game has a touch more snap about it."

Can anyone remember those days when the common assumption about Gareth Southgate was that he was too gentlemanly, too afraid of upsetting people and, ultimately, too damn nice to succeed in an industry where all the people at the top occasionally have to use their elbows?That nonsense stopped being trotted out once Southgate made it a priority to phase out Wayne Rooney, the player around whom England’s national team had been shaped for the previous decade. Theo Walcott found out he had been jettisoned with a telephone call on the morning of his 28th birthday and Chris Smalling was cast into the wilderness on the basis, as Southgate put it so bruisingly, that England needed central defenders who could play it out from the back. Smalling has helped Manchester United accumulate the most clean sheets in the Premier League but that, as far as Southgate is concerned, cuts no ice. Don’t think for one second that behind the polite demeanour, the perfectly knotted tie and the gentle touches, the manager of the England team is afraid of making the big calls.All of which may be useful in the coming days, with his squad for the World Cup to be announced on Wednesday, if tough questions have to be asked about whether it is still feasible to imagine Jack Wilshere can be the centrepiece of the project.Could anybody be surprised if Wilshere has to be cut free? Disappointed, yes, when England’s options in central midfield are never going to have anyone overdosing on optimism. But surprised? That’s a different matter entirely, when Wilshere is so notoriously fragile that choosing him would be to risk a potential no-show.Roy Keane, a television pundit whose lack of pleasantries should not mask the fact his on-air performances usually involve a hard, withering reality, already appears to have made up his own mind, with various diatribes about the way Wilshere has been “drifting” for too long. The debate, according to Keane, is no longer just about Wilshere’s fitness but more whether the Arsenal midfielder should now be considered “the most overrated player on the planet”.Overrated or not, Wilshere will always have a devoted fan club who recall the days when he was capable of shaping elite football matches and the happier times when it was easy to champion him as the great hope, the diamond of his generation.But then, of course, the injuries took hold, and consider what happened when Southgate recalled him for England’s friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy in March. It was Wilshere’s first call-up since that zombie-like performance for Roy Hodgson’s team against Iceland in the European Championship. He trained, he sat in front of the press to say how glad he was to be back and he promised that, this time, he felt better than ever. The headlines were written and then, on the day the team were due to fly to Amsterdam, an old knee problem flared up and he pulled out.If that was a one-off, if it wasn’t part of a wider pattern and so thoroughly predictable, it could be passed off as nothing more than unfortunate timing. Sadly for Wilshere, it was part of a narrative that would already have eliminated him from Southgate’s thinking were it not for the fact that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s ruptured knee ligaments have left England even more thinly spread in midfield than usual.Southgate, after all, knows from personal experience how disruptive it can be when a key player is lost through injury in a major tournament. In the 1998 World Cup, he started England’s first game against Tunisia alongside Sol Campbell and Tony Adams in a three-man central defence. The next day the squad flew back to their base at La Baule in Brittany and had a warm-down on their training pitches. Southgate usually wore strapping around his ankle because it had been weakened by previous injuries. On this occasion he didn’t think it necessary because it was meant to be only a light jog, nothing else. Then David Batty kicked a stray ball high in the air and Southgate, forgetting himself, went to control it, twisted his ankle and felt his ligaments go. It didn’t need an x-ray to know the diagnosis. “Out of the World Cup because of the most stupid injury imaginable.”Southgate’s distress that day was made worse by Glenn Hoddle’s insensitivities and the memory, sitting disconsolately on the team bus, of listening to his manager repeatedly shouting: “What were you doing?” in front of all the other players. “The circumstances of the injury galled Glenn,” Southgate later said. “They devastated me. All my life I had worked to get to the world stage, to prove I could do it at the highest level. This was my opportunity to change my international epitaph, to give the public something that might have stood alongside the [Euro 96] penalty miss. And now it was gone.”Equally, perhaps now Southgate is in charge, relying on the fitness of his players and wanting to build a recognisable system of his own, he understands better why “all Glenn could think of was the hole in his side and the probability of having to go from a back three to a back four”.Southgate did not go home from France. He stayed in the England camp and worked slavishly to get fit again, including three-times-a-day sessions with the team’s physios. He was told the injury would usually take five weeks of rehabilitation. He was back within two and came on a substitute in Saint-Étienne when England had their penalty shootout against Argentina.Wilshere, on the other hand, does not do near-miraculous comebacks from the injuries that have sabotaged his career. Plus there is overwhelming evidence that the cumulative effect has dramatically diminished his ability to influence games.Wilshere has managed 10 90-minute performances for Arsenal in the Premier League this season, though only two since 20 January. Last season, there were 15 on loan for Bournemouth and, before that, the last occasion was September 2014. For England, he has managed it only six times. On average, each of his performances in a 34-cap international career has lasted 56 minutes.Against all this, there is still the unshakeable fact that, every now and then, there are flashes to suggest Wilshere can still be a creative force. That is why, of all the selection dilemmas for Southgate, this might be his more difficult choice ahead of Wednesday’s announcement. But they are only flashes. Wilshere has to be vulnerable and, whatever Southgate decides, it is difficult to avoid the reality, as sad as it is, that the man in question will probably never be the player English football wanted him to be.That was a fine speech Jürgen Klopp delivered, in absentia, at the Football Writers’ Association annual dinner and particularly impressive in his praise for Rhian Brewster, Liverpool’s teenage striker, for his decision last December to speak publicly about the various incidents of alleged racial abuse he had encountered in his young football career.“During the past 12 months Rhian has established himself as one of the most exciting prospects in English football,” Klopp said. “He has grown and risen in status at Liverpool. He won the World Cup for your country at his age level. He won the Golden Boot at that same tournament. He made his family, his friends, his club and his country, proud. But it was away from the football pitch – and instead in the pages of a UK newspaper – where Rhian made an even bigger impact on the game we all love.”Admittedly, I’m a little biased in these thoughts, as the journalist Rhian asked to tell his story, but Klopp struck jut the right note when he described it “as frustrating and depressing as it is inspirational and uplifting” that it took a boy of 17, as Brewster was then, to speak up in the hope of shaming the sport into doing something about it.Hopefully, in the process it might have given the football authorities a necessary jolt. Yet it isn’t easy to be clear about that last point.Uefa decided there wasn’t enough evidence to proceed with his complaint about a Spartak Moscow player from a Uefa Youth League tie. I can understand that – and expected it – on the basis it was one boy’s word against another. Less acceptable, however, is Fifa offering the same excuse of “insufficient evidence” from an incident in the Under-17s World Cup final when it was not just Brewster but his team-mate Morgan Gibbs-White who reported a Spanish opponent. That’s the word of two boys against another – and hard evidence, you or I might assume. Or in the language of Fifa: move on, nothing to see here."

Thibaut Courtois  Preferred to Willy Caballero, he had little to do but made a brilliant left-hand save to deny Phil Jones in his first FA Cup match of the season. 7/10César Azpilicueta The Spaniard marshalled the back three impeccably and made a couple of important blocks, namely from Anthony Martial. 6Gary Cahill  A commanding display by the Chelsea captain but he was never rushed off his feet; comfortable with what was thrown at him. 7Antonio Rüdiger  Was rarely troubled and looked assured when needed; he formed a crucial part of the blue defensive wall that closed the game out. 6Victor Moses  Quiet going forward and a little clumsy defensively. He was fortunate to avoid a booking for a couple of plucky fouls on Ashley Young. 5N’Golo Kanté  Was still running when everybody else was walking. Took the sting out of countless United moves and dictated midfield tempo. 8Tiémoué Bakayoko  Was a bold call by Antonio Conte to persist with him over Willian given his struggles and was busy without doing anything special. 5Marcos Alonso  Presented with the chance to add a second but his effort on goal was fairly pedestrian. Not exactly at his best. 6Cesc Fàbregas  The Spaniard lost his FA Cup winners’ medal from 2005 but will surely keep this one safe after a gutsy display in both boxes. 6Eden Hazard  The best player on the pitch on his 300th appearance in a Chelsea shirt. Displayed guile and class, typified by his ice-cool penalty. 9Olivier Giroud  He linked well with Hazard and gave Chelsea a constant outlet but should have been punished for costly slip when Paul Pogba headed wide. 7Substitutes: Álvaro Morata N/A (for Giroud 89); Willian N/A (for Hazard 90).David de Gea Made a routine save from Hazard before going the wrong way for the penalty. Denied Alonso to keep United in it with 20 minutes to play. 6/10Antonio Valencia  The Manchester United captain had few chances to push forward and was kept on the back foot. Booked for a foul on the marauding Hazard. 5Chris Smalling  Easily dealt with the threat of Giroud, especially in their aerial duels, and made a couple of smart interventions. Strong display. 7Phil Jones  Led a merry dance by Hazard, who he scythed down for penalty. Worrying dress rehearsal for when England meet Belgium in June. 4Ashley Young  Lucky that Michael Oliver did not refer to VAR when the England defender appeared to handball a Moses pass in the box. 5Ander Herrera  Was asked to stifle and man-mark Hazard but he ultimately tried and failed to stifle the Chelsea playmaker. Fairly anonymous display. 5Nemanja Matic It spoke volumes that the former Chelsea midfielder was United’s most lively player. Unafraid to do the dirty work, as ever. 7Paul Pogba  Barring the odd foray forward, the Frenchman never really got into his stride; a wayward strike as good as it got. Nodded a free header wide. 4Jesse Lingard  The midfielder was shackled and struggled to dent the Chelsea backline before being replaced by Anthony Martial late on. 5Alexis Sánchez  Showed glimpses of quality and, occasionally, nimble footwork but was sloppy in possession. Another frustrating outing in a United shirt. 5Marcus Rashford  A willing runner and had a couple of half-hearted efforts on goal but largely failed to seize his chance to impress. 5Substitutes: Romelu Lukaku 4 (for Rashford 73) Not fit enough to start and ineffective off the bench; Anthony Martial 5 (for Lingard 73) Had a half-chance blocked by Azpilicueta; Juan Mata N/A (for Jones 87)."

Arsène Wenger’s head fell off and rolled across the glass table before plunging on to my living room floor. Last week, an hour after Arsenal had lost to Atlético Madrid, to ruin the fleeting dream of Wenger’s final match as manager being in the Europa League final, I had lifted up the old bobble-head and prepared to move it back to the window sill.As a family joke, and a worrying sign of my lifelong support of Arsenal, I had been given this wonderfully naff homage to the club’s greatest-ever manager years ago. The Wenger bobble-head had stayed in my office until March 2013 when, after a 3-1 home defeat against Bayern Munich, we needed a miracle in the second leg.Wenger was placed on the glass table in front of the television and Arsenal were rejuvenated. We beat Bayern 2-0 in Munich, only to suffer a familiar Champions League exit on away goals. But the mysterious force of the bobble-head had to be relied upon from that night as one Arsenal pattern – defeat in the last 16 – was replaced by another, in the habitual struggle to make the top four. With mini-Arsène in place, Arsenal went on an unbeaten 10-game run to steal fourth spot from Spurs by a point.Over the last two seasons of Wenger’s 22 years as manager, as the top-four tradition slid away, the world divided Arsenal’s fans into Wenger Out or Wenger In camps. It was hardly more subtle in our house. Should mini-Arsène watch the next game or did he deserve to be consigned to the window sill in his long zippered coat?Since Wenger announced his decision on 20 April to leave the club on Sunday, he has been on the glass table for every game. Yet the bobbled Arsène could not spook Diego Costa or Diego Simeone as Arsenal lost their last meaningful match under Wenger. The roll of his head, as I picked him up, felt symbolic.Andrew Allen, another Arsenal fan, endured a more testing ordeal that night. As deputy news editor at Arseblog, the celebrated Arsenal fan website which its founder and chief writer, Andrew Mangan, began in 2002, Allen was bereft of words as he tried to start his post-match analysis. “It’s very rare I get the responsibility to write the main blog,” Allen says, “and I knew if we won it’s easier to write. But, after we lost, I sat in front of the laptop for an hour trying to find an introductory paragraph. I couldn’t do it. Eventually I began jotting down moments from all these years under Arsène. It spiralled out of control and at three in the morning I was still there, down a YouTube rabbit hole, with the occasional tear and glass of wine. It poured out.”The next morning I still felt sad that Wenger’s last game in charge will be away to Huddersfield, rather than at home in France, in Lyon, against an old enemy, Marseille, in a European final he longed to win. But, turning to my usual read of Arseblog, there was no match report. Instead, the headline read: “No European Trophy. No Happy Ending. But…”Allen then listed 197 moments and memories, mishaps and milestones, stretching from “Three League titles. Thierry Henry. Giroud’s scorpion kick. Chu-Young Park. Paris in the pouring rain. Santi’s dancing feet. It’s Thierry Henry, he’s scored, he’s scored for Arsenal in the Bernabéu! Wright breaking Bastin’s record. Cesc’s mullet. Sol on a free. Abou’s ankles. Broccoli” to “Blackcurrant shirts. Giroud’s abs. It’s only Ray Parlour. Henry looping it over Barthez. Pizzagate. Pires … it was in from the moment he hit it! Santi’s cup final free-kick. Together. The Invincibles. 22 years. Thanks for the memories, boss. Thank you so much.”“I’ve written 3,500 articles for Arseblog News,” Allen explains, “but it’s rare I get to show emotion and the feedback was amazing. Even last Sunday [before Wenger’s final home game] strangers in the pub came up and said: ‘Oh, what about this or that one?’”He has equally evocative memories of that sun-kissed afternoon at the Emirates as, after a 5-0 demolition of Burnley, Wenger felt the Arsenal love again. “It was very emotional,” Allen says. “I sit next to my mum and dad and all three of us didn’t look at each other when Wenger spoke. I didn’t want my mum to see me tearing up and I don’t think she wanted me to see her tearing up. His name was sung with passion and it was a kind of joy. It took me over the edge.”Mangan, who lives in Dublin, flew in for the game. As the voice of Arseblog, he has probably written more words about Wenger than anyone else since 2002. “I won’t ever write as many words about another individual,” he says. “Arsène has been a constant in my life for 16 years – and the six years before I started the website.“For a long time Arsenal fans have been divided into unnecessary camps of Wenger In or Out. But the vast majority have a far more nuanced view of the last 22 years. So being there, listening to the fans sing with one voice about Arsène, felt cathartic. It felt healing.“It reminded me of the end of the Champions League final in 2006 when we lost [having been 1-0 up against Barcelona with 14 minutes left]. It was raining in Paris, and heartbreaking, but I’ll never forget the Arsenal fans singing. It was awful to lose but there was something really special after the game where all you could see was this sea of yellow. That was true of Sunday. There was a sea of red but the mood wasn’t mawkish. It was joyous and celebratory.”It seems true to real life that Wenger’s grand yet flawed 22-year reign should end in a meaningless game at Huddersfield. The home side avoided relegation on Wednesday and so, as the game will not be televised, Allen will “use some dodgy stream” to write a match report. “Our away form is ridiculous [Arsenal have not won a single away point in 2018] but there’s something weirdly fitting about ending up at Huddersfield where Herbert Chapman [another great Arsenal manager who enjoyed such success in the 1920s and 30s] made his name.“Of course it’s not the same as a European final in Lyon – and that’s why I was devastated last week. We all thought: ‘Please, please, let him win a European trophy.’ Of course I’m going to Lyon anyway. I have tickets, the hotel is booked. It was a choice between Arsène Wenger and Diego Costa. Diego won.”Allen sighs when asked who he might support in the final. “I don’t know. Me and my friends just might take a big Arsène banner.”Wenger has described his career at Arsenal as “a love affair”. Mangan hesitates when considering the phrase as a fan and writer who has examined Wenger’s attributes and failings so closely. “A love affair is too passionate for me. That stems from the frustration of the last years. It’s a relationship built on love and respect for a guy who came in when nobody knew him. He proved himself as a great manager and a great man. He was successful and he changed English football – and the perception of foreign managers and players. He was so brilliant there was always a yearning for him to replicate that in later years and it didn’t quite happen. I wanted Arsenal to win under Arsène – because of this respect, admiration and pride when you heard him talk about Arsenal, football and society.“Of course he’s an obsessive. On his birthday they asked him what was he going to do and he said: ‘I’ll watch a second division German game.’ The journalist urged him to celebrate his birthday. Wenger said: ‘I’ll put some candles on the top of my TV if that makes you happy.’ Arsène’s real passion was always football. That’s probably not too healthy but it’s a fundamental part of why he was in this job so long.”The Arseblog writers offer an often painful insight into Wenger’s failings. “In some ways his biggest fallibility was his willingness to be a force field who ensured all criticism centred upon him,” Allen suggests. “His refusal to throw players under the bus was beautiful but sometimes the players needed to be called out. Some of the signings were very odd – remember André Santos – but you never knew whether Wenger had more money to spend.”Allen was 13 when Wenger took over Arsenal in September 1996 and the Frenchman has given him some of the sweetest moments of his life. “Winning the title at Old Trafford in that double-winning season [in May 2002] was unbelievable. I was at university and had an exam at 9am the next morning. At 3am I was dancing outside Highbury, jumping around with strangers, after beating United on their own turf at the height of that rivalry. The Invincibles get the plaudits – but that 2002 team? Man, they were something else. The connections between Bergkamp, Ljungberg, Henry and Pires were beautiful.”How did Allen do in his exam? “I was studying Russian history at UCL, which is slightly niche. But I scraped through. Then, at the start of 2004-05 season, after we’d won the league and gone unbeaten, the first seven games were fantastic. I remember playing Middlesborough on another glorious summer day and my brother and I said: ‘How many will we score today?’ You know it can’t go on like this for much longer – but you never want to look that far down the line.”Amid the poignance of Wenger’s leaving there is the thrilling uncertainty of a new era. “I definitely have feelings of excitement around a new manager,” Mangan stresses. “What’s going to happen now? Who is it going to be? What kind of football does he like? What kind of a man is he? Who will he sign? How many of Arsenal’s values will be upheld? It would be awful to get a manager like Mourinho with no interest in young players. Maybe that’s just us being romantic Arsenal fans. Maybe we need to be more pragmatic.”Mangan and Allen would choose Massimiliano Allegri, the Juventus manager, to replace Wenger. “I like the idea of Allegri,” Mangan says. “He’s more defensively minded than Wenger. With our attack a manager who focuses on the defensive side, with the right organisation and personnel, could make everything gel. It’s hard to imagine, when you’ve got Mkhitaryan, Lacazette, Aubameyang, Özil and Ramsey, a new manager will do what Jack Charlton did to John Aldridge – and make them defend from the front and inhibit their attacking quality.“After 22 years there is excitement about something fresh and new. Even the uncertainty is interesting. We don’t know what the new guy is going to do or how he’s going to do it. We don’t know how it will work with the director of football, head of recruitment and chief executive all taking a prominent role. It’s a brave new world.”An Allegri-shaped world? “It’s just a gut feeling but they might go with somebody younger and less experienced,” Mangan says. “The power dynamic has been so weighted in favour of the manager they might go another way. If it’s Allegri or Luis Enrique they will have to defer to them. My gut says they might go for Mikel Arteta or Patrick Vieira.”Our Wenger bobble-head will be moved back to its final resting place, in my office. I like the idea of a mini-Max Allegri on the glass table but Allen also suspects it could be a different name. “I’m open to something left-field,” he says. “But every two or three years we’ll probably be changing our manager and that will be really hard to get used to. After Arsène, we’re in the madhouse with everyone else now.”Montage: David McCoy/Guardian Imaging"

Under normal circumstances, the announcement of the England squad for Russia would be our lead story. But Tranmere have just been promoted back to the Football League, while Liverpool are in the final of Big Cup. So it’s only fair that Evertonians should get the chance to trumpet some good news too. And they finally have some, as thousands gambol, cavort, frolic and prance all around Merseyside, to the tune of A Brand New Day from The Wiz, in celebration of Sam Allardyce’s sacking. Now admittedly England only name a World Cup squad once every four years, while lately Everton have been binning managers at such a lick, they’re in danger of making Mike Walker’s stint look like the era of Harry Catterick. But folk at Goodison have been really suffering for the last five months, give them their moment will you. They deserve this.Yes, on Wednesday morning Big Sam was bundled out of the door marked Do One and sent bouncing down the road on the seat of his trousers. He came to a halt on the corner of Gwladys Street and Bullens Road, not far from the stadium’s trade exit, which was just as well as he’d left something in his desk. “You forgot this!” screamed majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri, launching what appeared to be a large tin bucket down the street. As it deflected off Big Sam’s noggin with a dull clank, it became clear in the bright morning sun of a glorious new epoch that it was in fact his personal silver jigger. Sam – whose 24-match interregnum gives Ronald Koeman that Thomas H McIntosh sheen – sighed, upturned the bespoke beverage-measuring device, and sat on it to sulk awhile in the style of Oor Wullie. Help Sam’s boab!“Sam was brought in at a challenging time last season to provide us with some stability and we are grateful to him for doing that,” began a statement later issued by Everton’s incoming chief suit, Professor Denise Barrett-Baxendale MBE, whose stately handle registers an impressive 8.7 on The Fiver’s patented Sir Chips Keswick-o-meter. “However, we have made the decision that, as part of our longer-term plan, we will be appointing a new manager this summer and will be commencing this process immediately.” That process would appear to involve reclaiming the scrunched-up bit of paper from the waste bin with Marco Silva’s name on it, and employing the man they wanted in the first place back in November, if only Watford hadn’t gotten so shirty about it.So in absence of an interesting list of alternative candidates, let’s conclude this story with a roll-call of something else: Butland (Stoke), Pickford (Everton), Pope (Burnley); Jones (Man Utd), Cahill (Chelsea), Walker (Man City), Trippier (Tottenham), Rose (Tottenham), Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Young (Man Utd), Stones (Man City), Maguire (Leicester); Dier (Tottenham), Henderson (Liverpool), Delph (Man City), Loftus-Cheek (Chelsea), Morris-Dancing Fiver (Fiver Towers), Lingard (Man Utd), Alli (Tottenham); Kane (Tottenham), Rashford (Man Utd), Vardy (Leicester), Sterling (Man City), Welbeck (Arsenal).The cull of superannuated British managers continues apace: West Ham have decided against extending the contract of 2005’s David Moyes. As breaking news goes, it’s all a bit meh, given this outcome was pretty much expected back on 7 November, which was the day Moyes was given the job in the first place. Still, he kept them in the Premier League, which is an improvement on his performance at Sunderland. Sigh. It’s a long time since he could be spotted, bronzed and gleaming, swanning down the stairs of the Hotel Maria Cristina, his palatial digs in San Sebastián, isn’t it.Anyway, unlike at Everton, a long list has been cobbled together in search of a successor. And here it is: Manuel Pellegrini, Rafa Benítez, Sean Dyche, David Wagner and Paulo Fonseca of Shakhtar Donetsk. Good luck, Gollivan! Good luck, everyone!The rampaging left-back Ray Wilson, one of England’s World Cup winning heroes of 1966, has died at the age of 83. Wilson was the oldest member of the XI that played in the final at 32; it didn’t stop him hoisting Bobby Moore on to his shoulder during the post-match celebrations, captured forever alongside Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters in a tableau that has come to define English football’s greatest day. He won the FA Cup while at Everton, and enjoyed a lengthy spell with Huddersfield, remembered by fans of both clubs as one of their greats.

Shrewsbury will take a one-goal lead into the second-leg of their League One play-off semi-final against Charlton after Jon Nolan’s fine finish secured a 1-0 victory at The Valley.The division’s third-placed team, who had finished 16 points ahead of their hosts, absorbed early pressure and cleverly bought time until scoring the goal they deserved through the impressive Nolan.Lee Bowyer later accused Shrewsbury of time-wasting and claimed Carlton Morris should have been sent off.Shrewsbury had delayed play in the first half while Charlton regularly threatened, and after Morris remained on the pitch following a challenge on Jason Pearce that the interim manager felt should have been a second yellow card, they secured their winning goal.“They were wasting time, taking five minutes to take a goal-kick at the beginning,” said Bowyer. “The game’s only just starting and they’re wasting time. I don’t believe in doing things like that. If you’re winning 1-0 with 10 minutes to go then I understand it – not from the beginning. The referee [Simon Hooper] could have done a hell of a lot more.“The ref did well apart from that but he could have hurried the keeper up. The amount of time-wasting they were doing, and they still only put up four minutes [of stoppage time]. I don’t get it.“I’m new to this so it’s even more frustrating – at least when you’re on the pitch you can actually ask while you’re there. Then the fourth official [Andy Davies] just keeps agreeing with me, which makes it even worse, because I’m thinking: ‘Why can’t you tell him then?’”Shrewsbury’s manager, Paul Hurst responded: “We were never going to come and rush things when you’ve got 180 minutes to play. I’ve seen teams do a hell of a lot worse.”Charlton – being watched by their potential new owner, the Australian businessman Andrew Muir – had made a promising start. In only the fourth minute, Josh Magennis headed narrowly wide of the right post following Ben Reeves’ right-wing cross.Jake Forster-Caskey then swiftly followed that by breaking from midfield to the edge of the area, and sending a low, left-foot shot even closer to the same target. When the ball bounced kindly for Nicky Ajose, the striker ambitiously shot high and wide from 25 yards .Shrewsbury first threatened in the 17th minute when Nolan, having been fed by Bryn Morris, forced a fine save from Ben Amos after a dangerous run and shot from midfield, and the goalkeeper also saved Morris’ header from the resultant corner. Shaun Whalley then played in Morris from the right, and from 20 yards he curled a shot towards the far post, where the diving Amos again did well to parry wide.It was midway through the second half when the visitors enjoyed another period in which they almost scored. Amos, again, impressed in punching clear from Whalley’s corner while under pressure. From a free-kick Whalley then pulled back to the unmarked Nolan, and his curling shot crept just wide of the left post.Nolan’s winning goal arrived in the 80th minute. Following a promising build-up, the substitute Stefan Payne teed him up from 25 yards and he connected well to shoot beyond Amos and off the underside of the crossbar. Magennis’ again went close with a header in stoppage time, from another Forster-Caskey free-kick, but Henderson again saved to preserve Shrewsbury’s advantage."
football,"The last time Swansea City fell out of the top flight they sank through the leagues in no time and nearly ceased to existBy Steven Pye for That 1980s Sports Blog of the Sport Network

Swansea City lived the dream in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Their rise through the four divisions was rapid and their first ever season in the top flight, in 1981-82, was a thing of joy for their supporters. But their fall from grace was just as quick. They made it from the Fourth Division to the top of the First Division and back again in nine remarkable years.John Toshack arrived at Vetch Field as player-manager in February 1978 and, assisted by the man he replaced, Harry Griffiths, the former Liverpool striker led the club to promotion from the Fourth Division at his first attempt. Sadly Griffiths died of a heart attack a week before the season finished, but the team did him proud by winning their last two games of the campaign to earn promotion.They secured their second consecutive promotion in 1978–79 as Toshack brought in experienced players such as Tommy Smith, Ian Callaghan, Alan Waddle and Leighton Phillips to bolster a team already containing Wyndham Evans, Robbie James, Jeremy Charles and Alan Curtis. Piece by piece, Toshack was assembling a squad for the First Division, with John Mahoney, Tommy Craig, Leighton James, Dzemal Hadziabdic and Ante Rajkovic all joining the club.A 3-1 win at Preston in May 1981 secured Swansea’s place in the top flight for the first time in their history, but Toshack was not stopping there. Keeper Dai Davies joined for £45,000; Bob Latchford came in for £125,000; Colin Irwin became their record signing for £350,000; and Ray Kennedy arrived for £160,000. Those figures may not sound huge, but Swansea had also built a new East Stand and compensated residents who lived behind the construction. The financial strain was growing.Swept along on a wave of euphoria, fans were hardly concerned about the balance sheet on 29 August 1981, the day they played in the top flight for the first time. On a sun-drenched afternoon, the Swans tore into Leeds, winning 5-1. Leeds were not alone in having their feathers ruffled. Tottenham, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United all suffered at the feet of Toshack’s men during an unforgettable season, as Swansea threatened to pull off the unthinkable.Swansea went on a tremendous run in the new year, picking up 23 points from a possible 27 to go top of the First Division table with 12 matches to play. However, the gruelling season – including eight games in the Welsh Cup – began to take its toll and injuries hit them hard. The club lost five of their last six matches and had to settle for a sixth-place finish, still a remarkable achievement for a newly promoted side. But there was trouble ahead.In many ways, Swansea’s 3-0 defeat to Aston Villa in their last match of the 1981-82 season was a sign of things to come. Five teenagers made their debuts that day, with Toshack increasingly reliant on youngsters in a new era of financial scarcity. When Swansea could not pay Everton for the signings of Latchford and Gary Stanley, the Football League imposed a transfer ban on the club. Things were spiralling.With such a small squad, the last thing Toshack needed was an injury crisis. But Hadziabdic, Irwin, Mahoney and Curtis all missed parts of the 1982-83 season and new captain Kennedy was showing the first signs of his deteriorating health. The campaign had begun well, with two wins and a draw, but Swansea only won eight more matches all season. Relegation to the Second Division was confirmed at Old Trafford on Saturday 7 May 1983.The Swans had been swimming gracefully on the surface of the water but now everyone could see their frantic paddling. Rumoured to be £2m in debt, they lost a number of players – and staff – over the next year. Doug Sharpe replaced Malcolm Struel as chairman and Toshack resigned in October 1983 with the club bottom of Division Two before returning to the post just 53 days later. He should never have gone back; when he was finally sacked in March 1984, Swansea had won just four matches all season.Colin Appleton took over in May 1984 to lead the club in the Third Division, but he won just four league matches during his tenure and was sacked in December, a defeat in the FA Cup against Bognor Regis of the Isthmian League hardly benefitting his cause. John Bond came in and kept the club in the Third Division, a strong end to the 1984-85 campaign helping them avoid relegation by a single point.If Swansea fans hoped their last-day escape was the start of something good, they were sorely mistaken. A month later news broke that the club owed money to players, clubs, local residents, the police and various other bodies. Bond remained in charge for the 1985-86 season but results on the pitch paled into insignificance once the taxman came knocking. “The Inland Revenue has told us to pay up or shut up,” said club director Harry Hyde. Owing a reported £102,178 in taxes, Swansea City Football Club was put up for sale for anywhere between £750,000 and £1m.After various protractions, Mr Justice Harman of the High Court issued the club a winding-up order on 20 December 1985. “The club has misappropriated tax and national insurance deductions from employees’ wages, spent on heaven only knows what,” said Harman. “The company comes before me and throws itself at the mercy of the court. Nothing encourages me to extend the club any mercy.”Swansea pleaded for more time and the chance to keep playing, but it looked as if they would become the first club to go out of business during a season since Accrington Stanley in 1962. “There are four matches for Swansea over Christmas and I don’t think anyone will be able to put the money together before that, so it looks bleak,” said PFA secretary Gordon Taylor. Bond and his players were handed official dismissal notices and, just four years after topping the First Division, it looked as if the club had reached the end of the road.Fortunately, the “Famous Five” of Peter Howard, Harry Hyde, Bobby Jones, Mel Nurse and Dave Savage gave Swansea a kiss of life. After listening to plans made by the Famous Five, plus Sharpe and Struel, the court gave the club until 13 January 1986 to come up with a financial proposal. A friendly with Manchester United was arranged for the day of the hearing – a crowd of over 20,000 bringing in much needed gate receipts.When it was announced on 24 March that the club could continue running until the end of the season, a sense of relief flooded the city. The team were struggling – and heading down to the Fourth Division – but the fact the club was still alive was a blessing. Finally, in July 1986, Harman declared that the winding-up order had been dropped.Swansea kicked off the 1986-87 season in the Fourth Division, back where they started in 1978, but at least there was optimism for the future under new manager Terry Yorath. The city and supporters can thank the determination of a few individuals for saving the club. Relegation this season would hurt, but nothing can compare to the situation the club faced the last time they fell out of the top flight.• This article appeared first on That 1980s Sports Blog• Follow Steven Pye on Twitter"

David Moyes and Sam Allardyce face their former employers knowing that they could both be out of a job soon. Wayne Rooney, who has received an offer from DC United, is unlikely to feature because of a knee injury, so fans may have missed their chance to pay tribute to a legend. Moyes and Allardyce, on the other hand, are unlikely to be mourned if they are shown the door by West Ham and Everton respectively.

RB Leipzig midfielder Emil Forsberg could become Arsenal’s first signing since the appointment of Unai Emery as manager. Valued at £47m, the Swedish “anti-Zlatan” has also got antennae twitching at Atlético Madrid and Juventus. Freiburg’s Turkish defender Caglar Soyuncu has revealed that Arsenal are after him too and has said he’ll hold talks with the club in the coming weeks. Soyoncu will cost around £35m, while the Gunners also have Juventus full-back Stephan Lichtsteiner lined up in their cross-hairs. The Swiss international is available on a free transfer from 1 July and Arsenal are reported to have a deal in place to sign him.Having made it clear that he’s not entirely satisfied with life at Real Madrid in the immediate aftermath of their latest Champions League win, bicycle-kicking Welshman Gareth Bale is once again being linked with a summer move to Manchester United. José Mourinho is believed to be unconcerned by the amount of time Bale spends sidelined by injury, although some reports suggest Real’s match-winner is not hugely enamoured with the dreary manner in which Manchester United play under his potential new boss. German champions Bayern Munich are also understood to be monitoring the 28-year-old’s situation with interest. Having used his post-match interview to hint that he too might leave the Bernabéu this summer, Cristiano Ronaldo has since expressed regret over his comments and was decidedly more coy about his future during Sunday’s homecoming celebrations.While much is regularly made of the manner in which Real “always find a way” to win the Champions League, it’s difficult to escape the conclusion that it was Liverpool who found a way to lose it on Saturday night. Most people’s big finger o’blame is pointing at Loris Karius, whose brace of blunders either side of Gareth Bale’s stunning overhead kick gifted the match to the Spanish side. Having had question marks over his future going into the final, the German seems extremely unlikely to play again for Liverpool, who are expected to ramp up their interest in AC Milan’s Gianluigi Donnarumma, Roma’s Alisson and Atlético Madrid’s Jan Oblak.Not deemed good enough to get in a very ordinary Everton’s side last season, Ademola Lookman was farmed out on loan to RB Leipzig and impressed the Bundesliga side’s bosses so much they want to make the move permanent.Manchester United are ready to bid the thick end of £100m to bring Lazio midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic to Old Trafford, while Real Betis are eager to sign Andreas Pereira, the Brazilian winger who has spent the past two years on loan at Valencia and Granada. In other news pertaining to United, reports in Italy suggest Paul Pogba would quite like to go back to Juventus after a mixed season in which he shipped a lot of criticism.And finally, Fulham will begin their preparations for life back in the Premier League by signing 20-year-old Auxerre midfielder Lamine Fomba."

Roy O’Donovan has been slugged with a 10-match ban for his A-League grand-final kung-fu kick on Lawrence Thomas.After deliberating for three days following Tuesday night’s hearing, Football Federation Australia’s disciplinary and ethics committee came down hard on the Newcastle striker’s behaviour in injury-time of this month’s 1-0 loss to Melbourne Victory.It is the second-biggest A-League ban of all time, eclipsing the eight games he served two years ago while at Central Coast for headbutting Wellington’s Manny Muscat.Only Danny Vukovic has received a bigger suspension in the A-League, the former Mariners custodian copping a nine-month ban for striking a referee in 2008.It also means the Jets will be without their main marksman for a chunk of next season, although he can serve some of his sentence in the FFA Cup. O’Donovan has seven days to appeal the sanction.Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every dayThe Irishman was shown a straight red card and charged with serious foul play after his studs caught Victory’s goalkeeper Thomas flush in the jaw in the 93rd minute at McDonald Jones Stadium.During Tuesday’s three-hour hearing O’Donovan’s representation conceded his head-high lunge into Thomas’ face was “careless” and “reckless” but argued he had made a genuine play for the ball as part of a desperate attempt to equalise in the game’s final seconds.But the disciplinary committee wasn’t buying it, contending the “Hail Mary attempt” was always likely to endanger Thomas as he rushed out for the ball. FFA’s counsel Ivan Griscti also observed “it does appear that the player is looking at the goalkeeper”.O’Donovan also pleaded his case at length via video link from his native Ireland, claiming his vision was blurred after copping a stray elbow from Besart Berisha moments earlier and contending he didn’t realise he had made contact with Thomas’ head until he approached him to apologise after the match.Danny Vukovic: nine months and three months suspended, striking a refereeRoy O’Donovan: 10 games, kickingTiago Calvano: eight games and four suspended, holding a refereeKevin Muscat: eight games, serious foul playRoy O’Donovan: eight games, headbuttingNey Fabiano: six games, spitting"

Gary Cahill feared the worst when his phone flashed with a missed call from Gareth Southgate this month. He had ample reason to believe the England manager was preparing to deliver bad news. After being appointed captain in March 2017 Cahill found himself out of Southgate’s plans a year later, omitted from the squad for two friendlies and struggling for form at Chelsea.“I thought potentially it could be bad news because in my experience of being involved with England for seven or eight years you usually don’t get the call – you just receive the information that you’re going to meet up and what times,” Cahill said. “So to get the call a different way, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little bit nervous.”Cahill was driving to training at the time, preparing for Chelsea’s FA Cup final against Manchester United, and his thoughts were occupied by that fixture rather than the World Cup.“I was desperate to go and be in the squad like anybody else,” he said. “It was in the week leading up to the cup final so my emotions were all over the place. My mental state was fully focused on this final. That’s all I was thinking about. And then that came along and obviously I was delighted to get the news. There were a lot of emotions for me in that particular week and both turned out to be very good news. So let’s hope that carries on into the summer.”One of the hallmarks of Southgate’s tenure as manager so far has been the way he has communicated with his players, even when delivering bad news. He phoned Jack Wilshere, Ryan Bertrand and Joe Hart to let the trio know they did not feature in his plans for Russia. Cahill was extended the same courtesy when he was left out of a 27-man squad for friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy in March this year.It was a significant fall from prominence for the defender who Southgate had chosen to wear the captain’s armband against Germany in Berlin in March 2017 and played a key role in England’s World Cup qualification campaign. But Southgate had grown concerned at Cahill’s reduced role at Stamford Bridge, particularly after he was dropped from Chelsea’s defence after costly errors in Premier League games. As a result, the phone call did not come as a shock.“He spoke to me before he left me out. I respected him a lot for that phone call because I’d sooner find out from the horse’s mouth than anywhere else and nothing surprises me in football,” Cahill said. “Everyone is judged in months and weeks. You have a month where you score two or three goals and you’re the best thing since sliced bread. Or you have a month where you make a couple of errors and you’re finished. That’s the kind of way things go.“I played the majority of qualifying games for two years and then I was left out for the World Cup squad in 2014 when it was announced. Other people were in form, playing well, it is what it is. The thing I keep harping back to is dig into your character and make sure you perform well for your club to give yourself the opportunity. That’s all I tried to do. At that moment I took a knock – it’s not the first I’ve taken and I’ve had a lot of good times in football. I just needed to work harder, get in the team and show what I could do. On the last day of the season I lifted the Cup and there was the turnaround. It can happen quickly.”With 58 international caps Cahill is the most experienced member of the 23-man squad which will have an average age of 26 on 18 June when England play their first group game. He is also one of only 10 players in the squad who featured in England’s Euro 2016 campaign which ended with a humiliating defeat by Iceland. He insisted he would not be carrying mental scars from that early exit.“It depends on your personality and character. If you’re asking me that now I won’t even think of that when I’m over there. I will in the aspect of not want to experience that feeling again – it will just make me more determined to do well.“That game was so frustrating because we had unbelievable amounts of possession yet we never created anything with it. It took a long time to get over that. But we can’t harp on about the past, we’re looking to the future and we’re going into this tournament with a positive frame of mind. I think that’s the key for everybody whether you’re an England fan – or yourselves – to go in with a more positive attitude and we’ll see how far we can go.”The squad were enjoying the sunshine at St George’s Park, the FA’s centre of excellence on Monday. After a morning training session they posed for photographs for official FA promotional material, with Phil Jones still sporting a black eye he sustained during the FA Cup final. Jordan Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold won’t join up with the rest of the squad until Saturday at the earliest after featuring in Liverpool’s Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid. But their club mate Adam Lallana, who is one of four players on standby, is expected to report early to the squad get-together on Wednesday, waiving the extra days Southgate was willing to let him take after the Champions League final. It is understood he wants to prove he is fit should someone drop out. The 30 year old came off the bench to replace the injured Mo Salah after 30 minutes in Kiev and is thought to be next in line to travel to Russia if any of the midfielders or forwards are forced to drop out."

Keylor Navas 7/10 Lucky not to be punished by Van Dijk when he missed a corner but one his safer goalkeeping displays. Made a solid and important save from Alexander-Arnold.Dani Carvajal 5/10 Left distraught after being forced out of a second successive final by injury. Had only just returned from a hamstring problem and made a careless start.Raphaël Varane 7/10 Vulnerable to Liverpool’s press when in possession, and not the most physical, although made several well-timed interventions inside his penalty area to thwart Klopp’s side’s attacks.Sergio Ramos 8/10 The villain as far as Liverpool are concerned. Knew what he was doing when he dragged down Mohamed Salah but, as a defender, the captain was completely dominant.Marcelo 8/10 Made a convincing start to his duel with Salah before that headache departed. Was given more licence to attack and prospered but slow to react for Mané’s equaliser.Luka Modric 7/10 Given little time and space to dictate play due to the industry of Milner and Henderson. Tidy as always but only got into harmful areas when the game opened up.Casemiro 7/10 The unheralded but key part of this Real Madrid team performed effectively and diligently as usual, helping to curb Firmino’s influence on the Liverpool display.Toni Kroos 6/10 Operated too deep throughout the final and that left Ronaldo and Benzema isolated too often as a consequence. His passing was below its usual standard, too.Isco 6/10 Always searched for openings but could not get involved enough. Wasted a great chance to put that right when he hit the bar with only Karius to beat.Karim Benzema 8/10 May have been fortunate for the opener but, like any good striker, was alert to the possibility when Karius erred. Fared well in his physical battle with Van Dijk.Cristiano Ronaldo 7/10 A rarity in that this was a major final that the world player of the year did not bend to his will. May have done better with one header that Karius saved well.Substitutes: Nacho 7/10 (for Carvajal 37): A strong and positive replacement for the injured CarvajalGareth Bale 9/10 (for Isco 61): What an impact. Off the bench to win the final with a world-class goalMarco Asensio 5/10 (for Benzema 89): Brought on in the dying seconds as Zidane sought fresh legsLoris Karius 3/10 Two absolute howlers on the biggest stage of all. An appalling performance from which it will be difficult to resurrect a Liverpool career.Trent Alexander-Arnold 7/10 Again seen as a potential weak link and again responded manfully to keep Ronaldo relatively quiet. More of a problem when Marcelo advanced, though.Dejan Lovren 7/10 Set the tone for another impressive European display when he snapped into Ronaldo at the first opportunity. Won the header for Mané’s goal.Virgil van Dijk 7/10 May feel he should have done better with the header from Milner’s corner that Navas missed but fought well against Benzema and made timely interceptions.Andy Robertson 8/10 Good in the air and, as usual, his positive runs down the left posed a frequent problem to the Real defence. Superb tackle on Ronaldo stopped a certain goal.Georginio Wijnaldum 6/10 The most inventive of Liverpool’s midfield trio but could not get on the ball often enough truly to hurt his opponents. Drove the team forward to the end.Jordan Henderson 6/10 Neat and careful on the ball and worked hard defensively to prevent Isco having an influence on the final but unable to stamp his authority on the game.James Milner 7/10 His set-piece deliveries were Liverpool’s most potent weapon once Salah had gone. Also pressed ferociously from the start to help swarm the Real midfield.Mohamed Salah 5/10 Not how his phenomenal season was supposed to end. Left the pitch in tears and in agony after Sergio Ramos caused a shoulder injury that damaged Liverpool. Cruel.Roberto Firmino 6/10 So close to connecting with one header, threaded a brilliant ball into Mané and worked tirelessly but could not influence this European game as he has so many others.Sadio Mané 8/10 Stepped up after Salah’s injury and was Liverpool’s liveliest forward. Showed quick reactions to draw Klopp’s team level and unlucky to strike a post, too.Substitutes: Adam Lallana 5/10 (for Salah 30): Plunged into the game early due to Salah’s injury and not at his sharpest after injuryEmre Can 6/10 (for Milner 83): Brought on for a late rescue mission but to no avail in the end"

Anger and joy greeted the Football Association’s revelation of its redrawn women’s league pyramid on Monday morning when West Ham emerged as the biggest winners and Sunderland the greatest losers.If catapulting West Ham from the third tier into the all-professional, 11-team Women’s Super League next season is bold and controversial, so is the decision to demote Sunderland two divisions after refusing to allow them to retain their place in the top flight or drop a single rung lower.As expected, a newly formed Manchester United will join the predominantly part-time 12-team second tier, rebranded as the Championship from last season’s WSL2.This revamp follows the FA’s restructure of the women’s leagues and involved clubs having to reapply for their places late last year before a second, open application phase began in March. Its conclusion has led to Charlton, Leicester City, Lewes and Sheffield United also joining the expanded second tier but left Southampton, Crystal Palace and Derby County disappointed by the failure of their bids.According to FA sources emotions are “running high” at a few clubs whose applications for the remaining places on offer in the top two divisions were rejected.Sunderland are foremost among them. Quite apart from Melanie Copeland’s side finishing a creditable seventh in the WSL1 – which will now be known simply as the WSL – the club have played an integral part in the wider development of the English women’s game, producing a wealth of England internationals. They will now almost certainly drop two rungs of the ladder, to the Premier League northern division.Seven of Phil Neville’s Lionesses side, including Lucy Bronze, Steph Houghton, Jordan Nobbs, Jill Scott and Beth Mead, began their careers with Sunderland but things began to go wrong when their parent club effectively cut them adrift. According to their most recent accounts Sunderland Ladies lost £424,000 during the financial year ending July 2017. The deficit largely explains why they failed to apply for a Super League place in the initial round of bidding. Mead, now at Arsenal, tweeted: “Heartbroken is an understatement. Absolutely devastated for SAFC Ladies, all the girls, staff and fans.”By March the composition of the top two divisions was largely established but nine vacancies remained. Fifteen teams, including West Ham and Sunderland – now operating in conjunction with Northumbria University – pitched to fill them.The FA has decided that, because of the shortage of bids, it will expand the Super League from 10 teams to 11 rather than the 12 or 14 envisaged. Sunderland’s exit means there is no team north of Manchester in the top tier. West Ham’s arrival strengthens London’s influence and has delighted David Sullivan, their parent club’s co-owner.“Gaining Super League status is an incredible achievement for everyone involved in our ladies’ team,” Sullivan said. “I would like to say very well done and congratulations for all their hard work.”Decisions are subject to appeal, to be made within 14 days, and Sunderland have said they are “considering” their position. In the meantime the future will be shrouded in uncertainty for Copeland, who has assisted Neville with the England side, and her squad.Apparent anomalies abound. Yeovil were granted a top-flight place in March, having convinced the FA they had raised the £350,000 required to turn professional but they scored only two goals in 18 games last season and managed only two points.Brighton, who finished second in WSL2, received a top-division licence in March, while Doncaster Belles, who finished a place above them, were denied promotion because of a lack of viable finances.The second tier expands from 10 to 12 sides with Manchester United investing around £5m in their side. “Starting a professional team from scratch is challenging but rewarding and we will make every effort to provide the women with the support and experience needed for them to be successful and to uphold the traditions of our great club,” said Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman. Woodward is expected to confirm United’s women will be managed by Casey Stoney, a former England defender.ArsenalBirmingham CityBrighton & Hove AlbionBristol CityChelsea (pictured)EvertonLiverpoolManchester CityReadingWest Ham UnitedYeovil TownAston VillaCharlton AthleticDoncaster Rovers BellesDurhamLewesLeicester CityLondon BeesManchester UnitedMillwallSheffield FCSheffield UnitedTottenham HotspurUnited’s fellow newcomers are an interesting bunch. Leicester are receiving heavyweight support from their parent club; the Charlton head coach, Riteesh Mishra, is a rare British Asian football manager; Lewes are noteworthy for last year becoming the first English club to pay their male and female players the same; and Sheffield United make the leap from the fourth tier to become the second team from Sheffield in the Championship.A restructure under which Watford and Oxford United drop into the third tier is the brainchild of Baroness Sue Campbell, the FA’s head of women’s football. “There have been some difficult decisions to make but they’ve been made with the sport’s best interests at heart,” she said. “This is a hugely exciting time for the game and I am hopeful we will look back on this as one of the most significant decisions made in its history.”The Super League and Championship start on 8-9 September."

Alexis Sánchez has admitted he has struggled to adapt to José Mourinho’s style of play since joining Manchester United from Arsenal.The Chilean failed to make an impact during United’s 1-0 FA Cup final defeat to Chelsea at Wembley on Saturday and, in general, has only intermittently shone for United since arriving at Old Trafford in January as part of the deal that saw Henrik Mkhitaryan move to north London. Sánchez has managed only three goals in 18 appearances and is often on the periphery during matches.“I think that in every game I’ve played in I’ve maybe found it hard to adapt to the style of play and I’ve been getting to know my team-mates,” said Sánchez.The loss to Chelsea meant United ended the season without a trophy, but Sánchez, speaking before the encounter with Antonio Conte’s side, is optimistic about the future. “I believe that United really is a very big club on a worldwide scale and even more so in England where it’s the biggest,” the 29-year-old said. “They always want to win and to be fighting on all fronts and that’s the reason I wanted to come here.“I also had some great players alongside me at Barcelona, some highly experienced guys who had great quality. I think that United are not too dissimilar as a club to them in their size and stature. However, we still have areas where we can improve, and we can do this day-to-day and a game-to-game basis. I believe we need to improve in all aspects.”United finished second to Manchester City, their highest place since the title win in Sir Alex Ferguson’s last season five years ago. Yet their 81 points still left them 19 behind Pep Guardiola’s team. Sánchez believes the away losses to the three promoted sides – Huddersfield Town, Brighton & Hove Albion and Newcastle – ultimately proved costly.“We need to be focused and concentrated in the big games and the same in the so-called lesser games too,” he said. “That’s what the great sides do and I think United are a great side, so that’s what we need to do. Manchester United is a massive club that always aspires to win big trophies and that is what I’m trying to make happen. I want to try and keep improving so we can see the club winning trophies.”"

In years to come, somebody will write a cracking book about David Wagner’s Huddersfield. It won’t be The Fiver, because by then we’ll be in the retirement community, rocking back and forth and boasting about how we once had a face-to-face interview with Les Reed. But somebody will do it, because in the last two years they have produced one of the more charming stories in English football history.The book will include a great chapter on 9 May 2018. Sod the actual football, though their 1-1 draw at Chelsea was bursting with an infectious, demented heroism. The really good bit will be the story of what happened afterwards. Huddersfield abandoned plans to fly back north and spent the night drinking expensive bottles of Liver Compromiser. “You never know who you will find partying at Chinawhite,” boasts the website for the famous London nightspot. “Recent attendees have included the likes of: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Moss, Tom Cruise, Cara Delevingne, Rihanna, Drake, One Direction, Kendall Jenner, Idris Elba, Ciara, Lewis Hamilton, Naomi Campbell, Jordan Dunn, Rita Ora, Usain Bolt, Gigi Hadid, Laurent Depoitre, Jonathan Hogg and Mathias Jørgensen, aka Zanka.” After a night of diligent rehydration, the Huddersfield players got the train back up north on Thursday morning looking an absolute state. There’s a strong whiff of Old Football about Huddersfield, and that’s high praise where The Fiver comes from. Their manager David Wagner – whose reaction to avoiding relegation was to give the players a free pass for 48 hours – has shown what can be achieved without ridiculous money, ego, entitlement or a razor; we’ll forgive him and his team their comically brazen time-wasting. Wagner, the players and the fans are involved in a virtuous love triangle that The Fiver would find genuinely moving were we not clinically dead inside.Mind, if Huddersfield aren’t careful they’ll receive English football’s new kiss of death: the phrase “Model Club”. It used to apply to Southampton and Swansea, one of whom will be relegated on Sunday. It will almost certainly be Swansea, and it has now emerged that Carlos Carvalhal will be quietly bundled out the door marked ‘Do One’ at the end of the season. Chris Coleman, a specialist in getting teams out of the Championship, is the early favourite, although we quite like the odds of 5,000-1 on our stereotypical cousin, Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch Fiver, getting the job. He’s Welsh, you know. In years to come, somebody will also write a cracking book on Swansea City in the 2010s. For the most part it’ll be a rollocking, feelgood yarn.

The “Ich bin ein Terrier” T-shirts, adorned with David Wagner’s smiling face, rapidly sold out of Huddersfield Town’s megastore at the start of this season, testament to the devotion the German manager has inspired at the Yorkshire club since joining as a relative unknown two and a half years ago. The reverence is sure to have deepened after Wednesday’s draw at Stamford Bridge, which enabled Huddersfield to complete the most remarkable survival of the Premier League era.Wagner suggested at that start of this season that Huddersfield were the biggest outsiders in the history of England’s rebranded top flight and bookmakers agreed, installing them, as soon as they won promotion via last season’s Championship play-offs, as odds-on favourites to finish bottom. It was a logical forecast, as Huddersfield had risen despite finishing with a negative goal difference in the Championship and failing to find the net in the play-off semi-finals or final until shootouts. And Huddersfield’s resources were paltry even by Championship standards so it was easy for anyone not paying attention to their manager’s special rallying power to view their elevation to the Premier League as an aberration that would soon be rectified. Easy and wrong.Other clubs of comparable means have been exposed as impostors in the Premier League. Swindon excelled to reach the top flight in 1993 but were bundled straight back whence they came, finishing 10 points adrift at the bottom after conceding 100 goals. Blackpool made a better fist of it in 2010-11 and played with endearing brio but ultimately failed to last more than a season, Ian Holloway’s gallant side ending in 19th place. Sean Dyche has exceeded all reasonable expectation at Burnley but Phil Brown’s Hull are the only underdogs of comparable pedigree to this Huddersfield team to have survived. They did so thanks to a whirlwind start to the 2008-09 season, their first in the top flight. But that achievement, laudable though it was, has been surpassed.Hull collapsed over the line in 2009, surviving with 35 points after running out of steam and winning just one of their last 22 matches. They stayed up but were clearly heading down. They duly sank the following season. Huddersfield have survived by showing qualities that suggest they could endure among the elite for the first time in more than half a century. That is some going given the ground they have had to make up on rivals with far stronger bases and much bigger spending power.Huddersfield spent nearly £40m bolstering their squad for the Premier League last summer, and added Alex Pritchard for £11m in January, but that outlay amounted to about the same that Manchester City spent on one full-back and less than Everton forked out for Gylfi Sigurdsson. None of their players cost as much as, say, the £18m that Stoke spent on Kevin Wimmer, and their wage bill is the lowest in the league, with no one in Huddersfield’s squad earning even close to the amount that West Brom pay Grzegorz Krychowiak, for instance. But Huddersfield have invested shrewdly and worked in a way that has shown money is not everything.That started from the top, as the decision by the chairman, Dean Hoyle, to keep season ticket prices low despite joining the aristocracy of the Premier League helped retain a rousing atmosphere at the John Smith Stadium throughout the campaign. Hoyle’s announcement before the start of the season that he would not contemplate sacking Wagner even if Huddersfield fell to the bottom of the Premier League also helped to preserve focus.Of course, Hoyle made that commitment because he knew he had an outstanding manager. Wagner had demonstrated, after taking over in November 2015 when the club were 18th in the Championship, that he is a leader of rare charisma and intelligence. To gain promotion he forged a method and generated an indomitable spirit that enabled his team to transcend their limitations, and he has done the same this season. The players he brought in last summer had the attributes and character to deepen the squad’s quality without diluting its spirit.Huddersfield will certainly need to become sharper up front – improving creativity and goalscoring is surely the next stage of their development – but the unity with which they have fought has been uplifting to watch even when flair has been absent. They have made far more tackles (715, with the next most prolific on 657) than any other team in the league.Summer signings such as the goalkeeper Jonas Lössl, centre-back Mathias “Zanka” Jørgensen and the right-back Florent Hadergjonaj have fitted in well alongside players such as the underrated midfield dynamo Jonathan Hogg and the understated defensive colossus Christopher Schindler. They were tipped to be thrashed every week but, excluding the top five, only one team (Watford) have allowed opponents fewer shots on goal than Huddersfield.It is a tribute to the can-do culture that Wagner has created, and to his ability to make small tactical adjustments, that every time it looked as if Huddersfield had slipped into a downward spiral like the one that ensnared Hull in 2009, they pulled out a momentous result. They had not won for seven matches before beating Manchester United in October; they had lost five away games in a row before trouncing Watford 4-1 at Vicarage Road in December; they shook off a post‑Christmas slump by gaining back-to-back league wins over Bournemouth and West Brom in February; and they defied prophesies of doom for the run-in by earning draws at Manchester City and Chelsea.Sunday will be a day of celebration at the John Smith Stadium, of Arsène Wenger’s last match with Arsenal and of Huddersfield’s exceptional achievement. The next big challenge that Huddersfield may have to face is fending off approaches for their manager. Arsenal, for one, could do a lot worse than ask Wagner to uplift them. Not that he is looking to leave a club where he and everyone else seem happy."

David Beckham is to take on a leadership role in the fashion industry, a move that consolidates the standing of Beckham and his wife, Victoria, who is a designer, as the first couple of British fashion.As newly appointed ambassadorial president, Beckham will on Friday visit educational fashion projects and clothing manufacturers in Manchester. The post, which Beckham described in a statement as “the chance to get under the skin of an industry I love”, will comprise two parts. The British Fashion Council hopes to leverage Beckham’s fame to attract a new generation of domestic creative and business talent into the industry by encouraging young people to view fashion as a potential career. Meanwhile at a global level, the draw of the Beckham name is expected to bring international investors to the table and secure financial backing for talented young designers.“I’m really excited about promoting fashion as an opportunity to all kids across the country, regardless of their background or their gender,” Beckham told the Guardian, adding: “That means creating more awareness for boys to get involved with fashion ... helping them understand that creative opportunities are available to them too.” Beckham appears to have form in encouraging young men to pursue careers in the industry: his eldest son, Brooklyn, is studying photography at the New York fashion school Parsons.Stephanie Phair, the newly appointed chair of the British Fashion Council, described Beckham’s role as that of a “global figurehead”. Beckham will host an event at menswear shows in London in June Trips to China and the US are in the pipeline. But he will take a backseat during September’s London Fashion Week in order to give Victoria, who is bringing her catwalk show home from New York to celebrate her 10th anniversary in fashion, her turn in the spotlight.The role is another step in a striking evolution from brashly dressed footballer to a front row regular who already has a place at fashion’s top table as the majority owner of the Savile Row label Kent & Curwen. The British Fashion Council hopes that the power of the Beckham brand – which has proved hugely valuable to the designer names he has promoted and the magazines he has appeared in, and has spawned trends from tattoos to flat caps – will prove lucrative on the global stage for British fashion, an industry Beckham described on Thursday as “one of our best performing exports”. Beckham, keen to restore his public reputation after a furore last yea r around leaked emails in which he appeared to bemoan not having been given a knighthood, said he wanted “to support an industry that’s been so good to me”."

Four days have passed now, so it’s probably time to cut Loris Karius a little slack. After all, he’s not exactly the first keeper to make a howling mistake in the biggest game of his life. There’s Sven Ulreich only last month in the Big Cup semi-finals. Oliver Khan in the 2002 World Cup final. Peter Bonetti at Mexico 70. And the Fiver’s personal favourite, Laurent Di Lorto, in goal for France against Italy in the quarter-finals of the 1938 World Cup, volleyballing a soft shot into his net, then running beak-first into the post. At least Loris didn’t suffer that slapstick indignity upon spiking Gareth Bale’s exploratory waft into the onion bag last Saturday. Then again, Laurent only made the one career-defining error during the 90 minutes. And he was never captured on film shanking a goal kick out for a corner, either. Hmm, this defence of Liverpool’s custodian isn’t going so well, is it. But you can only work with the raw materials you’ve got.Still, onwards and upwards. And there’s already one man prepared to give Karius a second chance. Giorgio Grassi, president of Rimini, has written an open letter to the poor lad, offering him a year’s loan at the newly promoted Serie C club. Grassi argues that the benefits of such a move are manifest: the seaside resort is a “land of hospitality often frequented by your countrymen”; the club is the “ideal place to rediscover your serenity, self-esteem and strength”; and that as part of a “large family” he can become “the umpteenth example of a footballer who falls and rises”. It’s a persuasive argument, though Grassi also points out that they’ve already got a good keeper in 35-year-old Francesco Scotti, so Karius shouldn’t expect to walk straight into the team. From the biggest game in club football to a place on the bench in the Italian third tier? Oh Loris!Whether this would be the best career move for someone suffering from an acute case of confidence knack is a moot point. Then again, Karius can’t exactly be sure of his place in the Liverpool starting XI come the new season, either, so it’s swings and roundabouts. The Reds are reportedly lining up world-record bids for Alisson of Roma and Atlético Madrid stopper Jan Oblak. Presumably they’re doing so in the hope of landing one or the other, as opposed to accidentally signing them both at the same time, like Gérard Houllier did back in the day with Jerzy Dudek and Chris Kirkland. Here, while we’re on the subject, Safe Hands Sander Westerveld’s flaptastic performance in the 2001 Euro Vase final doesn’t look half as bad these days, does it.“In my final chat with him, at the hospital, I promised him I would get a call-up and play for my country. And I managed it. I wasn’t nervous going out on the pitch but I was proud, so proud. I just thought: ‘This moment is for my dad,’ because we waited for me to get that call-up and unfortunately he didn’t see it. Maybe he was watching” – Poland and Ipswich keeper Bartosz Bialkowski has a chat with Nick Ames. Yes, it’s our not-singing, not-dancing World Cup Fiver.

Iain Dowie coined the word bouncebackability in the 2003-04 season when describing how his Crystal Palace team had gone from the fringes of relegation in December to winning promotion through the play-offs in May. Not many managers have been responsible for adding words to the English lexicon but Dowie shared the honour with Sir Alex Ferguson in 2005 when both “squeaky bum time” and “bouncebackability” entered the Oxford English Dictionary.It is fitting that Dowie came up with the word while discussing a side promoted in the play-offs, as bouncebackability has been remarkably common in so many sides who have won promotion in these showpiece finals. Of the 10 beaten finalists who have returned to the same fixture the next season, nine have succeeded second time around – and the only exception made amends a year later. The first team to do it were Tranmere Rovers under their legendary manager Johnny King, who had promised to take supporters on “a rocket ride to the moon” when he took over at Prenton Park in 1987. King did not quite achieve lunar orbit but he did take the club to Wembley twice in a week in 1990.Their first trip to the capital was for a 2-1 win over Bristol Rovers in the Leyland Daf Trophy final. Unbeknown to the Tranmere players, their play-off opponents were among the crowd. Notts County manager Neil Warnock had insisted on all his players attending to gauge their opposition. The reconnaissance mission worked for Warnock, who oversaw County’s 2-0 victory, the second of his record-breaking eight promotions. Tranmere made amends the following year when they beat Bolton in the play-offs final to earn promotion.The club has just repeated this feat. Despite playing for 89 minutes with 10 men, they beat Boreham Wood in the National League play-off final a fortnight ago. Perhaps they were given extra motivation from losing the same final last year.The day before Tranmere’s triumph in 1991, Blackpool lost out on penalties to Torquay in the Fourth Division final, with centre-forward Dave Bamber missing the crucial fifth kick. A Torquay fanzine was named Bamber’s Right Foot to commemorate the miss.Blackpool returned to Wembley the following year and Bamber scored their goal in a 1-1 draw against Scunthorpe United. So the Tangerines had to face their second consecutive shootout. Their 4-3 victory on penalties was especially sweet given their experiences the previous year. Bamber, understandably, did not take part in the shootout, leaving it to David Eyres to score the crucial spot-kick.Two days after Blackpool enjoyed their success from penalties, Leicester lost to Blackburn in the Division Two final thanks to a controversial spot-kick awarded for a tackle by Steve Walsh on David Speedie. Mike Newell, a former Leicester player, scored from the spot and the goal was enough to give Blackburn a place in the inaugural Premier League season. Leicester lost out again the following season to another penalty, this time dispatched by Paul Bodin to make it 4-3 to Swindon after the Foxes had fought back from 3-0 down to draw level.Leicester could have felt sorry for themselves after these cruel defeats but they reached the final for a third consecutive season in 1994 and finally gained promotion by coming from behind to beat Derby County courtesy of two goals from Steve Walsh. That Walsh had suffered such heartbreak in those two defeats must have made it all the more satisfying.Two years later, Walsh was back at Wembley to captain Leicester in a play-off final for the fourth time in five years, but this time another Steve proved the matchwinner as Claridge scored the winner in the 121st minute against Palace. The timing of the goal rankled for Palace fans and so did the nature of it – Claridge admitted in his post-match interview that he had “shinned it”. Recovering from this desperate defeat, Palace returned for the 1997 final and, just as the game was meandering towards extra time, skipper David Hopkin collected the ball outside the area and curled a sumptuous shot into the Sheffield United goal. This time Palace had the last-minute winner and this time Palace were off to the Premier League.Gillingham produced an even more impressive display of resolve a couple of years later when they recovered from the most dramatic defeat in play-offs history. Having scored in the 81st and 86th minute to take a 2-0 lead in the 1999 final, the Gills looked destined to reach the second tier for the first time. Those dreams were shattered when Kevin Horlock and Paul Dickov scored for Manchester City to force extra-time. Almost inevitably, Gillingham lost the penalty shootout to compound their misery.When Gillingham returned to the final the following year, it looked as if they were in for yet more heartbreak. Having taken an early lead, Gillingham found themselves trailing 2-1 in extra time and staring a second painful defeat in the face. Two late goals in the 114th and 118th minutes gave them a 3-2 victory in one of the last games to be staged at the old stadium.While Wembley was being rebuilt, the play-offs finals moved to the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, which was the venue for the next comeback. Alan Pardew’s West Ham responded to the disappointment of losing 1-0 to Dowie’s bouncebackability team in 2004 by beating Preston with a single goal from Bobby Zamora. This was redemption for Zamora as the previous year he had missed a clear-cut chance, had a goal ruled out for offside and was substituted soon after Palace took the lead. The 2005 final was only part of his redemptive story; Zamora also scored the only goal of the game nine years later when QPR beat Derby in the final to win promotion to the Premier League.Even though Dowie coined the term about Crystal Palace, it is their near neighbours Millwall who have since become the kings of bouncebackability. They are the only club to have achieved this considerable feat twice, securing promotion to the Championship on both occasions: against Swindon in the 2010 final and against Bradford in the 2017 final.A couple of characters epitomise the spirit involved in this pair of fightbacks. Tony Craig played for Millwall in all four finals, even captaining the side to victory in 2017; and Neil Harris played in the first two finals and managed the club in the second two.Sandwiched between Millwall’s two victories, Huddersfield Town recovered from a 3-0 defeat to Peterborough at Old Trafford in 2011 to beat Yorkshire rivals Sheffield United in the League One final the following year on penalties. Huddersfield held their nerve in the longest-ever shoot out in a play-off final when all 22 players took part, ending with United’s keeper Steve Simonsen blasting his kick over the bar.The onus is now on Exeter City to continue the remarkable trend. Having lost to Blackpool in the League Two final last year, they have the chance to make amends on Monday when they face Coventry City in the same fixture. Paul Tisdale has been here before with Exeter. His team beat Cambridge United in the Conference National League play-off final in 2007 – a year after they lost the same fixture to Morecambe. As the season reaches squeaky bum time, Exeter have a chance to show that bouncebackability is alive and well in the play-offs.• This article is from the author of The Agony and the Ecstasy• Follow Richard Foster on Twitter"

Chelsea travelled to Bristol City on Tuesday needing a point to clinch the Women’s Super League title, and thereby the double, with one game to play. They have produced some stunning free-flowing attacking football but that was not on display on this occasion. Instead, the Blues showed the grit of champions as they ground out a 2-0 win with what the striker Fran Kirby, who provided the assist for Jonna Andersson’s goal, described as an average performance.One person absent from the touchline and the celebrations, yet overwhelmingly responsible for the team’s success, was Emma Hayes. Rather than shouting and leaping from her seat in the dugout, as is often the case, the Chelsea manager watched her team clinch their second double – her double double if you like – from her sofa at home, with an altogether different double on her mind: the imminent arrival of twins. Hayes is 35 weeks pregnant and this season she has juggled Chelsea’s phenomenal campaign with the emotional and physical demands of pregnancy.It is an incredible feat and has put the 41-year-old in a bigger spotlight. Yet her management, recruitment and development of players deserve the spotlight on their own.Hayes joined Chelsea in 2012, replacing Matt Beard, who moved to Liverpool. She had gained managerial experience in the US, having been assistant manager at a then all-conquering Arsenal, and she swiftly set about building the team she wanted to lead.Two years into her Chelsea reign the side narrowly missed out on the WSL1 title – on the last day of the season to Beard’s Liverpool – and a squad overhaul, which included winning the race for Kirby’s signature for a British record fee, put Chelsea on a firm footing for 2015.That year, Chelsea won their first double. An FA Cup final victory over Notts County – the first time Wembley hosted the final – was followed by an emphatic 4-0 win at home to Sunderland to seal the league.It confirmed what Hayes is good at: analysing the strengths and weaknesses of her players, finding ways to pull more out of them than they might have thought possible, and working out how to take her team to the next level.It is what she has done this season too. The arrival of Manchester City on the women’s football scene offered a different challenge and they toppled Chelsea from their perch in 2016, Nick Cushing’s side winning the league by five points. But whereas City have failed to build on that, and have ended a promising season without a trophy, Hayes has reconstructed her side, again, into one of the world’s best despite an ever-improving field around her.Hayes’s ability to sign players who dramatically improve her squad is enviable and it is hard to see where she has put a foot wrong. After City’s title win, Hayes brought in Ramona Bachmann from Wolfsburg and the Swiss forward has shone alongside Kirby and Ji So-yun up front, her two goals in this year’s FA Cup final the icing on the cake.Deanna Cooper arrived from London Bees at a similar time and was a mainstay in the Chelsea defence as they won the Spring Series (the mini-season designed to bridge the gap between the old summer league and new winter one). A cruciate ligament injury ruled her out for most of this WSL season but she returned in Chelsea’s last home game.Hayes, recognising defensive weakness before the campaign, brought in Sweden’s Magdalena Eriksson and Norway’s Maria Thorisdottir and, in January, Andersson – who has scored four goals in her nine appearances – and Anita Asante. All when called upon have stepped up to the plate.Despite injuries and a fixture pile-up that has come from the winter switch, Hayes has built a squad capable of being rotated to excellent effect. It is well balanced, with experience and youth gelled, and she has a remarkable likability that makes players want to run through walls for her.Hayes, having signed a contract extension until 2021, will no doubt, despite having two new familial team-mates set to disrupt things, be preparing to rebuild and recruit again as the captain, Katie Chapman, leaves, the striker Eni Aluko moves on, Claire Rafferty departs after 10 years and others look destined for the exit.Having lifted Chelsea from five points behind City in 2016 to nine points clear with a game to play, Hayes means business. Next on the hit list is the elusive Champions League and increasing her five major trophies in west London. If history is anything to go by, she is the manager capable of doing it."

A former Chelsea youth player has alleged that Gwyn Williams presided over a “mini apartheid state” there and may join a group of former members of the junior setup seeking to take legal action against the club.The player, who wishes to remain anonymous, was prompted to explore legal action after reading in the Guardian about the experiences of other former Chelsea youth players.Amid mounting allegations of abuse, denied by Williams, Chelsea have brought in Barnardo’s, Britain’s largest children’s charity, to oversee an independent investigation.It is understood more players are set to come forward to allege racial abuse in the 1980s and 1990s. The latest player to speak out said he decided to go public after reading the accounts of Grant Lunn and Gary Baker, two white men who played in Chelsea’s youth setup in the early 1980s. They supported accounts by black former Chelsea players who alleged a culture of racist abuse and bullying under Williams, a key figure at Stamford Bridge for 25 years. Williams is said to have arranged “whites against blacks” matches in training.“It’s amazing that when you read other people’s stories more and more of the jigsaw puzzle fits together,” the player said. “I saw a picture of Gwyn on the news – an old picture – and it was shocking; it brought it all back.“At the time you don’t think anything of it because racism was the norm; it’s quite tragic really. But once I saw the article I’m thinking about doing something through the legal channels.“Reading about the white v black matches stirred my memory,” he added. “Gwyn used to do that sometimes. But I remember one evening John Hollins [the Chelsea manager] came to train with us in the evening and he [Williams] was as good as gold, much different from usual. It was at Battersea Park and I remember Gwyn being a completely different person almost and thinking: ‘He’s being quite nice.’“When we used to train at Stamford Bridge it was like a mini apartheid state,” he claimed. “We all used to be given lunch money but the suspicion was that the white trainees were getting more money because they’d have all the Armani gear and the best black players would be walking round like second-tier citizens.”The Guardian published a story in January recounting the stories of three former youth-team footballers from the 90s who are issuing legal claims against Chelsea. One of them, now in his late 30s, described it as a “feral environment” for some of the black players in the youth team, alleging they were treated “like a race of fucking dogs”.They also implicated former England international Graham Rix, accusing him of subjecting them to racist abuse. Rix has denied that.“I never came into contact with Rix,” the player, who previously played youth football for West Ham, said. “But there wasn’t any sort of support network at Chelsea where you could have complained at the time. When I was at West Ham it was completely different. West Ham was four or five top coaches who were always there with their specialisms looking after you at the same time. At Chelsea it was Gwyn Williams with a couple of people definitely beneath him. There was no doubt about who was king of the castle at Chelsea – it was always Gwyn.”Eddie Johns, solicitor for Gwyn Williams, said: “We stated in January, on behalf of Gwyn, that he denied all and any allegations of racial abuse. That denial continues. I can add nothing to that. Other than reminding you of that denial I am not able to assist you further.”Chelsea, who are under different ownership from the time of the allegations, said: “We take allegations of this nature extremely seriously and they will be fully investigated. We are absolutely determined to do the right thing, to assist the authorities and any investigations they may carry out, and to fully support those affected which would include counselling for any former player that may need it.”"

Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi could have played together at Arsenal had things worked out differently.Arsène Wenger, who took charge of the final game of his 22-year reign on Sunday, has revealed how he tried to sign both in 2003. Ronaldo went to Manchester United before joining Real Madrid and Wenger was unable to prise Messi from Barcelona.Wenger told Arsenal.com: “The obvious player [Arsenal missed out on] that comes to mind is Ronaldo. He was here with his mother and we were very close. Then Man United came in and they had Carlos Queiroz at the time, who was their coach. United played against Sporting Lisbon and Ronaldo was outstanding and they signed him.“There is always something you could have done differently but the problem of negotiations is to know when you give in and when you don’t give in. Once we were at £4.5m, we were still in negotiations. David [Dein] met with [the agent Jorge] Mendes in Paris and he was representing Sporting, so we were very close but Man United went to £12m, which we could not afford.“I met Cesc [Fàbregas’s] parents and at the time we were interested in Messi and [Gerard] Piqué as well.

This article is part of the Guardian’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.Anyone who has been watching Uruguay over the past 10 years is familiar with Óscar Tabárez’s style: his teams are built from the back to make it as difficult as possible for opponents to score. Then it is all about giving the ball to the team’s world-class forwards, Luis Suárez and Edinson Cavani.His Uruguay sides have always been strong in central defence, with full-backs who attack only when absolutely necessary. Then there is a midfield that traditionally has been much more combative than creative, with an emphasis on moving the ball forward as quickly as possible. It has been vertical football with one aim – to hit opponents on the break. Until now Uruguay have not needed to be much more than firm in defence and dangerous in attack – but then something happened. The team, together for so long, needed renewing, especially in midfield. And this changing of the guard has happened much more quickly than anyone thought possible. With the new players, a new style arrived. The emergence of players such as Federico Valverde (Deportivo La Coruña on loan from Real Madrid), Rodrigo Bentancur (Juventus), Nahitan Nández (Boca Juniors) and Matías Vecino (Internazionale) forced Tabárez to change his approach. In the end, with these dynamic and talented players, the transformation of Uruguay’s gameplan was almost inevitable.For a long time Tabárez had said that Uruguay did not have the players to adopt a “European” style, ie physical as well as creative. Now he has them and, in the last World Cup qualifiers and subsequent friendlies, he has used a different approach. The defence remains the same, with Diego Godín and José María Giménez being that rare combination at a World Cup – a pair who play together week in, week out (for Atlético Madrid). To the left, the hope is that Martín Cáceres (Verona) will arrive in good shape after two injury-hit seasons, and on the right there will be a battle between the experienced Maximiliano Pereira (Porto) and the young Guillermo Varela (Peñarol) to be in the XI.It is in midfield where the real change has happened: Vecino is a guaranteed starter after a superb season with Inter but then there is a question of whether Betancur or Valverde will accompany him – both prefer to go forward and create rather than carry out defensive duties but they have developed from playing in Italy and Spain respectively. To the right, Nández is expected to start while on the left Cristian Rodríguez is the preferred candidate, although he lacks the endurance of his earlier years. In attack, well, there is not much to add to the names of Cavani and Suárez.Remember, though, that structural changes take time to become a habit. The basic concept of 4-4-2 with pressure all over the pitch has not altered but the central midfielders now treat the ball better and the service to Suárez and Cavani is much improved. We also know that the World Cup is not a place to experiment. It is possible that, in the event of a poor result in the opener against Egypt, Tabárez will return to his more defensive approach. It would not be the first time: in the first international tournament of his second spell as Uruguay coach (the 2007 Copa América in Peru) he suddenly abandoned his initial approach of using three forwards.Probable starting XIWhich player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup? Nahitan Nández. The pressure of playing in the World Cup will not be a problem. In fact, it will probably make him play even better. A leader who was made captain of Peñarol at the age of 21 and is a star at Boca Juniors aged 22. Which player is likely to disappoint? It could be Cristian Rodríguez. He has been a vital part of the team for a long time but, at 32, lacks the intensity and speed that are key to a wide player’s game.What is the realistic aim for Uruguay at the World Cup and why? The quarter-finals. Getting out of Group A (with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Egypt) should not be a problem but in the last 16 they could face Spain or Portugal. Get through that and France or Croatia may lie in wait. And that is probably the limit for this team. Ignacio Chans writes for El Observador.Follow him on Twitter here.

Arsenal are in talks to sign Stephan Lichtsteiner on a free when his contract at Juventus expires this summer, with the right-back among Unai Emery’s targets.The 34-year-old, who is expected to captain Switzerland at the World Cup in Russia, could become the Arsenal head coach’s first signing.Lichtsteiner, who joined Juventus from Lazio in 2011, was recently linked with Borussia Dortmund after confirming he would exit the Serie A club.“I’m playing in one of the biggest clubs in Europe and there’s always competition for places,” Lichtsteiner told Mediaset after making his 300th appearance against Bologna this month. “But my future is going to be away from Turin. At the end of the season I’m leaving. I’ll play abroad next year but I’ve not signed anything yet.”The attacking full-back has won the domestic title in each of his seven seasons at Juventus and made 27 Serie A appearances in the campaign that has just finished despite the arrival of Mattia De Sciglio from Milan.Lichtsteiner was not named in Juventus’s squad for the Champions League group stage but returned against Tottenham and Real Madrid in the knockout rounds. He has played 98 times for Switzerland, appearing at two European Championships and two World Cups.Emery was appointed as Arsène Wenger’s successor at Arsenal this week and is working as part of a set-up in which Raúl Sanllehí and Sven Mislintat, the head of football relations and recruitment respectively, will oversee transfers. Lichtsteiner would compete with Héctor Bellerín for a starting place."

Argentina showed once again how reliant they are on Lionel Messi as the Barcelona forward scored a hat-trick in their 4-0 World Cup warm-up win over Haiti.With Javier Mascherano making his 143rd appearance to put him one ahead of Javier Zanetti as Argentina’s most capped player, Messi got the opener from the penalty spot after 17 minutes.He doubled their lead 12 minutes into the second half with a simple tap-in after the goalkeeper could only parry a header, scored Argentina’s third after 65 minutes, and then set up Sergio Agüero to make it four just two minutes later.Argentina failed to add to their tally but should have been further ahead against Haiti, whose sole appearance at the World Cup finals came in 1974 and are ranked 108th in the world, 103 places below them in the world rankings.Agüero was fit again after a knee injury but began the game on the bench, with Gonzalo Higuaín and Ángel Di María starting up front alongside Messi. However, both men failed to shine and instead it was Agüero and Boca Juniors’ Christian Pavón who staked their claim for a World Cup place when they came on after an hour.A makeshift and inexperienced Scotland side were beaten but not disgraced in their 2-0 loss to World Cup-bound Peru at the frenzied Estadio Nacional in Lima.It was all going pretty well for Alex McLeish’s men until the 37th minute when Christian Cueva scored from the spot after defender Scott McKenna had handled in the penalty area.Lokomotiv Moscow’s Jefferson Farfan made it 2-0 from close range in the 47th minute with Millwall keeper Jordan Archer, one of four starting debutants, looking culpable again after his misjudgement had led to the earlier penalty.Northern Ireland were unable to spoil Panama’s World Cup send-off party as the hosts drew with another home nation ahead of facing England in Russia next month. Having drawn 1-1 with Wales in November, Los Canaleros held a strong Northern Irish side to a 0-0 draw on a hot and sticky night in Panama City. Michael O’Neill handed debuts to three players, all from the bench, and his team were fortunate that Edgar Joel Barcenas’ first-half header came back off the crossbar on an evening of celebration for the Panamanians ahead of their first World Cup."

The Fiver always was dubious that Gareth Southgate would take Joe Hart to the Ethics World Cup because of his tournament experience. Admittedly it didn’t seem too outlandish when people suggested he should be included in the England squad in a Pepe Reina-esque cheerleader role, there to keep spirits in the camp high with his b@ntz and sagely advise Jack Butland and Jordan Pickford on how best to scream at unsuspecting Russian ball boys. For a while it seemed Southgate was going to bring him along for the ride. Until, that is, England’s manager discovered that the person leading the clamour for the Manchester City goalkeeper was none other than Shortbread McFiver, our Scottish cousin. Sneaky Shortbread McFiver! Bad Shortbread McFiver! Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch Fiver, our Welsh cousin, was also in on it and for some unknown reason their underhand campaign was garnering plenty of support in Belgium, Panama and Tunisia. Funny, that. But luckily Southgate cottoned on to their devilish ruse, at which point his mind was made up. Hart, who spent most of the season either on West Ham’s bench or chucking the ball into his own net, would not be going to Russia.The 31-year-old received the bad news on Monday and the worst thing, perhaps, is that nobody was that surprised when the media spilled the beans on Tuesday. There was no uproar about uncapped Nick Pope being chosen instead, no controversy, no immediate cry for Southgate to apologise to Meghan and Harry for overshadowing their big day. Instead everyone shrugged and wondered where it all went wrong for Po’ Joe, who was once so promising and talented and free of dandruff.Since you ask, The Fiver reckons it was when he started gurning at Andrea Pirlo at Euro 2012, which is the kind of wisdom Pickford and Butland will have to live without this summer. Plus he probably should have thought twice before moving to West Ham on loan given that playing behind one of the Premier League’s worst defences didn’t exactly do wonders for his fragile confidence. Mind you, it did give him a chance to get to know Andy Carroll better. At least those two can get on with booking their summer holiday to Vegas now. Southgate, meanwhile, is only thinking about Russia. Having submitted his provisional 35-man squad, all he needs now is a new No 1. It’s between Butland, who’s just been relegated with Stoke, or Pickford, who chucked a couple in against West Ham on Sunday. What could possibly go wrong?

football,"Parma were declared bankrupt and relegated to Serie D in 2015. Now the club is ‘back where we belong’By Yousef Teclab for The Gentleman UltraYousef Teclab

Thu 24 May 2018 14.30 BST

It took the court just 10 minutes to declare Parma FC bankrupt in March 2015. The quick decision ended months of torment in which the club had been docked points on several occasions; players and staff had gone without their wages; games had been postponed because they could not pay stewards; the club had been sold – twice – for €1; and, having finished sixth in Serie A the season before, they had sunk to the bottom of the league.Mercifully, Parma were allowed to finish the season in Serie A, with relegation to Serie B a formality. However, when the club could not find a new buyer or pay their debts – which totalled $218m, including unpaid wages of €63m – they were denied a place in Serie B and were folded for the second time in a decade. They would have to start the 2015-16 season, as Parma Calcio 1913, in Serie D.Like Fiorentina, who went bankrupt in 2002, and Napoli, who suffered the same fate in 2004, Parma had to re-form in the lower leagues and set about returning to Serie A. A group of local entrepreneurs, called Nuovo Inizio (New Beginning), took over the club, appointing former coach Nevio Scala as president and the former player Luigi Apolloni as manager. Both men had won various domestic and European trophies in Parma’s golden era in the 1990s, which helped the club connect with their past. The fans were remarkably loyal, buying more season tickets in Serie D than they had in the club’s final season in Serie A. Not only did the fans help generate matchday revenue but they also bought shares in the club through a crowdfunding scheme. Their support on the terraces was reciprocated on the field. II Ducali won promotion to Serie C in style, going unbeaten all season and amassing the highest points total ever recorded in the league.Escaping Serie D at the first attempt was merely the beginning for Scala. “We are enjoying the rewards of an extraordinary ride,” he said in April 2016. “Let’s enjoy the victory, as it’s the first of a process that we hope will see us as contenders again next year.”Parma’s next promotion, to Serie B, was won the hard way. After a string of defeats early in the season, Apollini was sacked. Roberto D’Aversa, in just his second coaching job, took over and turned things around. He guided Parma to second place, enough to give them a spot in the last-16 stage of the gruelling play-offs. Parma beat Piacenza, Lucchese and Pordenone to set up a final against Alessandria in late June. With club legend Hernan Crespo in the crowd to offer support, they won 2-0 to seal promotion to Serie B.Back-to-back promotions attracted the interest of Chinese businessman Jiang Lizhang, who bought a 60% stake in the club to become Parma’s majority owner and new president. Lizhang was wise. He ensured the club kept its local feel and did not alienate fans. Nuovo Inizio held on to a 30% stake, while the supporters retained 10%. Lizhang appointed Hernan Crespo as vice president and set his sights on a third straight promotion: “Parma will rise again like a giant to take back its rightful place in Italian football. I hope we can soon celebrate Serie A with the team and the fans.”His wish came true last weekend. Going into the final day of the regular season, Frosinone were in pole position to finish second and earn automatic promotion to Serie A. Parma needed to win at Spezia and hope Frosinone would drop points at home to Foggia. With just over an hour gone, it was on. Parma were 2-0 up and Foggia were beating Frosinone 1-0. As things stood, Roberto D’Aversa’s men were going up. But this script would offer at least one more twist.In the space of five minutes, Frosinone scored twice to take the lead against Foggia and leapfrog Parma in the table. With the clock ticking down, it seemed as if Parma would have to settle for another tilt at the play-offs. But then, with just one minute of the season remaining, Foggia substitute Roberto Floriano scored an equaliser at Frosinone. They had left it late, but Parma had done it.Their captain, Alessandro Lucarelli, had been the beating heart of their renaissance. He had remained a beacon of strength throughout, offering to stand by the club as far back as February 2015: “I’d be prepared to play in Serie D for Parma if it was necessary. After seven years, I feel like this shirt is mine and I’m available to play for this club at whatever level.”True to his word, he stood by the club when they fell to Serie D, the only player to do so. In 2016, on the day they secured the first of their three straight promotions, he said: “I am experiencing some indescribable emotions today. The message that comes from Parma today is that we’re back. We hope this is just the beginning of a great journey that will take us back where we belong.”Time has proved him right. Lucarelli, now 40, has been a commanding presence in defence, embodying the collective effort of a side that works hard for each other. He is also a man who kept a promise: that he would take the club back to Serie A. When he spoke to the TV cameras last weekend, he was overcome with emotion. “It can’t be true, it’s not possible, I can’t believe it,” he said, his voice cracking. “We have done something incredible in these past three years. Something out of this world. No one could have imagined a finale like this. I’m dying. It’s more than a dream. This promotion is a great prize for our fans who together with us never gave up. I am proud to be their captain. Now I can even retire.”Lucarelli is due to hang up his boots this summer but many fans would like to see him make at least one last appearance for Parma in the top flight. Whatever happens, the story of his club’s incredible renaissance will be told for many years to come.• This article first appeared on The Gentleman Ultra• Follow Yousef Teclab and The Gentleman Ultra on Twitter"

The mellifluous ooh sound Les Murray fashioned when forming the word football is the source of vivid Proustian memories throughout Australia. It transports the world game’s true believers to weekend afternoons watching Murray and Johnny Warren putting the world to rights. For tourists to planet soccer it’s the soundtrack to the World Cup, those quadrennial winters when Murray invited himself into the nation’s front rooms to steward the uninitiated through festivals of futbol.For the first time since Mexico 1986 Murray will not be headlining Australia’s World Cup broadcast. He died last year aged 71, three years after announcing on-air that Brazil 2014 would be his last tournament in front of the camera. He leaves behind enormous shoes to fill.The task of maintaining Murray’s World Cup legacy falls not only to his successors at SBS, but Optus Sport, the pay-TV provider that is attempting to pivot from telco to Australia’s home of live football. For Russia 2018 Optus Sport have sub-licensed the World Cup rights from SBS. In a deal that satisfies anti-siphoning regulations, every minute of Russia 2018 will be available to Optus Sport customers while a hand-picked 25 matches plus highlights remain on free-to-air. Those matches include all Australian group games, two quarter-finals, both semis and the final. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every dayIn other words, it’s still possible to engage with the World Cup without putting your hand in your pocket, but if you want the total immersive experience it’s going to cost a little extra: $14.99 per month to be precise, unless you’re an Optus customer with access through a complementary service, like a postpaid mobile or broadband connection. All the content will be streamed online, accessible via an app or found on TV through interfaces like Chromecast and Apple TV. It is a step into the future, and one not welcomed universally. Australian consumers are accustomed to major sport being accessible for free and without the technological risks associated with streaming services – such as the ones experienced by Optus Sport during the early days of its coverage of the English Premier League. It will take time to establish consumer trust, but executive producer Richard Bayliss is confident it is a mission his team can accomplish.“The technology is now is light years ahead of where it was a year or two ago,” Bayliss tells Guardian Australia. “And there are scores of people whose job it is to make sure everything goes off without a hitch and having seen how hard they’ve been working in the lead-up to the World Cup I don’t think people should be concerned at all.”It remains to be seen if Optus Sport can pull it off. Credibility is on the line with the World Cup representing the highest profile test to date of the nascent platform, and they can expect the slightest malfunction to be pounced on by disgruntled subscribers with any errors magnified by rival media agencies.The on-air production sounds ambitious with Bayliss, Mel McLachlan and Jules Breach anchoring a live broadcast stretching for 11.5 hours through the Australian night. Around the matches there will be supplementary content delivered from the Red Square studio, all with a focus on capturing the real-time experience and responding to unfolding events. For their sake, let’s hope there’s plenty to talk about. Over at SBS Lucy Zelic has inherited the hot seat from Murray and she will anchor the one live free-to-air match as well as the daily wrap show that will go out at 5.30pm AEST. “It will be a very poignant moment when we first go on air without Les,” explains Stuart Randall, executive producer for sport at SBS. “But we’re going to ensure we honour his memory throughout the tournament and we’re going to do a couple of little things to ensure he has a presence throughout our coverage.”For fans alternating between offerings, SBS’s package contains one notable advantage – live commentary from Martin Tyler, arguably the most respected English language football commentator. Otherwise the talent on display across productions will feature the usual assortment of former players and coaches, doubtless engaging in varying levels of air-filling analysis and “banter” to which we have become accustomed. SBS has opted not to invest in any supporting entertainment content this year, which means no Jimeoin’s Full Brazilian or Santo Sam & Ed’s World Cup Fever. “Football is about many things,” Murray intoned during his final piece to camera at Brazil 2014. “But most of all it is about joy, a medium by which our lives can become more fun, something which makes us smile through our toils. The World Cup, more than the football, is about having a good time, about having a party, and as parties go, this has been the grandest of them all.” The next party begins with the opening ceremony from Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium on Thursday 14 June. Australia’s first encounter is against France two days later. Sleep can wait until August. "

Jack Wilshere and Joe Hart have both spoken out on their disappointment at being omitted from Gareth Southgate’s England squad for the World Cup.Hart, who has 75 international caps, and Wilshere, who has 34, both failed to make the 23-man party announced on Wednesday – and were also absent from the standby list.“Think its about time I had my say,” Wilshere posted on his personal Twitter account. “It goes without saying that I’m naturally incredibly disappointed to have been left out of the England squad for the World Cup.”“I’ve felt fit, sharp and strong all season and believe I should be in the squad! And given the chance I could have made a real impact,” the Arsenal midfielder added.“However, I have to respect the manager’s decision and would like to wish the whole squad all the very best for the tournament. I will always be an England fan and will be supporting the boys with the rest of the nation.”Wilshere, who last played for England in the loss to Iceland at Euro 2016, at least saw the funny side when one tweeter invited him to Zante on holiday instead. “Let me know the dates and I’m in,” he replied.Hart spoke out in an Instagram post on Friday morning. Underneath a picture of the England crest, he wrote: “Not going to lie, I’m gutted. After two years of trying to make the most of a really tough situation, this is hard to take.”“I’m proud to have put in the graft and play every minute to qualify with the team and have a really important input in that outcome,” Hart added. The goalkeeper was picked for England’s first nine qualifiers, with Jack Butland starting against Lithuania after their place in Russia was assured.“I know what I bring to the team, but it is what it is. Good luck to the team out there, the players know that even though I won’t be there, I will have my England shirt on as a fan this time and supporting all the way. No fear, go and smash it.”Hart, who has struggled for form in loan spells at Torino and West Ham, missed out to Jordan Pickford, Jack Butland and Nick Pope – with Pope’s Burnley colleague Tom Heaton on the standby list.Wilshere, who made only 12 Premier League starts with Arsenal this season, was overlooked for a central midfield berth with Southgate selecting Fabian Delph, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Jordan Henderson and Eric Dier.The England manager explained both decisions during his press conference on Thursday, and said that leaving out Hart was “a difficult call”.“In Joe’s case, he’s been England No 1 with 75 caps. I don’t think it would be respectful to say to him, ‘would you go on standby?’” Southgate said.“We either put him in the squad, or we think of what he’s done up to this point and hope that he resolves his club situation this summer and that he’s back contending for the No 1 shirt, not the No 3. That I think was the right thing to do.”Southgate said that Wilshere “has of course been in our thoughts,” but he had opted to stick with players who appeared in pre-tournament friendlies – with the exception of Delph, “who had a fantastic season with the champions”.“Jack had a good spell [this season] but was maybe not as effective towards the end of the season,” Southgate added. “We’re very open minded in terms of what we want.”"

“A40, Hanger Lane, turn left on to the North Circular, past Stonebridge Park and over on my left was Wembley,” says Steve Perryman, recounting his journey from Northolt to training at Tottenham Hotspur as a teenager, a drive he could do with his eyes closed these days. “I would go past it twice a day, there and back, usually sat in traffic, and you conjure up images and think: ‘I hope I play here again.’ And now we are back there with Exeter.”The League Two play-off final against Coventry City on Monday will be particularly pertinent given it is Perryman’s final match before retiring – after 51 years in the game. He grew up in the shadow of Wembley, going to the dogs on a Friday night with his older brothers and playing on Ealing Common. “It is extraordinary and, if I could have written it, I guess this is how it would have finished,” he says.The 66-year-old Exeter City director of football estimates he has been involved in around 2,500 matches, via Norway and Japan, including FA Cup finals at the old Wembley. He played there against Scotland in front of 100,000 for England schoolboys as a 15-year-old but for 12 of the past 15 years he has, alongside the longest-serving manager in the country, Paul Tisdale, resuscitated and revived fan-owned Exeter on fumes. There, it is a constant rebuilding job. At the end of every season they are resigned to selling their best players – David Wheeler, Ollie Watkins and Ethan Ampadu last summer – and Tisdale could follow Perryman out of the door.The Exeter manager is at a crossroads after the Supporters’ Trust voted to serve notice on his two-year rolling contract in November 2016, a decision that hurt him but seemingly galvanised the team. At the time Exeter were 23rd in the table but went on to reach the play-off final last season, losing to Blackpool. “It’s like snakes and ladders when you get to 99 and then crash to zero – we don’t want that again,” Tisdale says.Another neat subplot to Monday’s match, after which the 45-year-old expects to finalise his future, is that Tisdale is good friends with Mark Robins, the Coventry manager, having played with him for Panionios in Greece. Robins, too, has been happy to integrate youth from the club’s prestigious Category Two academy. Tom Bayliss, a 19-year-old winger, is among the homegrown players who have flourished in the first team this season, a path trodden by James Maddison and Callum Wilson, who joined the club aged seven and 11 respectively. For Coventry, who have slid from the Premier League to the fourth tier, players such as Bayliss, Jordan Shipley and Jordan Ponticelli have provided hope on the darkest of days.The goalkeeper Lee Burge and Jordan Willis, two more academy graduates, have excelled this season. They are, Robins says, the lifeblood. In the past 12 months Coventry have sold the England Under-16 international Charlie McCann to Manchester United and the midfielder Ben Stevenson to Wolves. The aforementioned Coventry players have prospered at the Alan Higgs Centre, the academy’s home until at least 2023 after an extension for the site was struck by the chief executive, Dave Boddy. Finally, there are green shoots, regardless of the result against Exeter.“I played against Coventry when we [Spurs] won the FA Youth Cup in late 60s; myself and [Graeme] Souness,” Perryman says. “They were in the top league then, they were known as the most progressive club in the country and from then they slipped down to end up here. Maybe this is the start of them rising to the top again.”Tisdale, in tandem with the director of football, has accelerated the development of young players from Exeter’s academy, as did his predecessors the late Eamonn Dolan and Alex Inglethorpe, now the academy director at Liverpool. Four of the regular back five are Devon-bred, including the captain Jordan Moore-Taylor and Dean Moxey, who returned to the club last year. “It’s no good having a youth policy if you have a manager that doesn’t want to pick young players because of fear about making a mistake, costing you three points and maybe your job,” Perryman says. “Tis is a terrific manager. He could do any job at Exeter City; he could be the chairman, Trust chairman, he could be the scout, he could play; he’s so intelligent, so switched on, that he should probably be managing director.“Exeter was a little bit of a joke – and now it’s not. Because of the geography, we are still rated as a small club, ‘little Exeter down in the south-west’, but people know we are a serious little club. The question Exeter have to ask themselves is: is fan ownership, which is good for getting you out of the grief, enough? And have they got the ambition to push on or do they want to stay as they are? At the moment it is producing players to survive, and the club was nearly dead.”Perryman is looking forward to the freshness he hopes retirement brings, to spending less time on the road and more in the garden, as well as making the trip “home”, to the new White Hart Lane, after struggling to get to more than one game per season there over the past 30 years. Before that, after a lifetime in the game, he hopes to go out with a bang. “This manager and this group of players are so classy, with their actions, discipline and their belief in the manager’s way. Promotion would be total vindication of how Tis and Exeter City play.”"

Jürgen Klopp will make a renewed attempt to prise the goalkeeper Alisson from Roma this summer as he looks to upgrade Liverpool’s squad following defeat in the Champions League final.While Liverpool players refused to blame the “infinitely sorry” Loris Karius for defeat against Real Madrid in Kiev, with Dejan Lovren appealing for criticism of the 24-year-old to be restrained, their manager has already made plans to sign a new first-choice goalkeeper for next season.Alisson, Liverpool’s opponent in the Champions League semi-final, remains Klopp’s favoured choice with the Brazilian scouted extensively throughout the season.Roma, however, have been resistant to dialogue with Liverpool this year and it will require a considerable offer to test the Italian club’s resolve. Alisson’s employers have also been scarred by internal criticism for selling Mohamed Salah to Liverpool last summer for £36.9m. There were fears that the Egypt international could miss the World Cup with the shoulder injury that changed the complexion of the final although he tweeted on Sunday night that he is “confident” he will be available.Jan Oblak of Atlético Madrid has also been linked with Anfield but Klopp was prepared to persist with Karius after his £4.7m signing from Mainz responded well to being confirmed Liverpool’s No 1 ahead of Simon Mignolet. But that was the position prior to the aberrations that contributed to the 3-1 defeat in Ukraine. The Liverpool manager insisted he and his club “will be with” Karius as he comes to terms with the errors that enabled Real Madrid to record a third consecutive Champions League triumph. He may have to broaden his search for a new first choice keeper should Roma maintain their stance on Alisson.Klopp’s plans for midfield improvement are in place with Naby Keïta secured for £52.75m from Red Bull Leipzig and Lyon captain Nabil Fekir targeted for a transfer costing a minimum of £60m. Klopp will be armed with a sizeable transfer budget having made around £70m for reaching the Champions League final and banked £142m from the January sale of Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona.Karius was inconsolable after the final on Saturday and apologised to Liverpool fans and team-mates for his two mistakes. On Sunday he extended his apology on social media. “I know I messed it up with the two mistakes and let you all down,” the goalkeeper wrote. “Haven’t really slept until now. The scenes are still running through my head again and again. I’m infinitely sorry to my team-mates, for you fans, and for all the staff. I’d just like to turn back the time but that’s not possible.”Liverpool players were criticised for not consoling the young German keeper immediately after the final whistle but there was only support for Karius afterwards.Lovren said: “When we win, we win together. When we lose, we lose together. Don’t blame him. It’s easy to blame someone but we are in the same ship together and everyone gave him the best words that they can. He will come back strong. You cannot find the words. He had a difficult start last season, so I believe in him. Don’t make massive stories about that. Of course it’s big because it’s a final, but everyone makes mistakes.”Andy Robertson had a similar message for the Liverpool keeper. “We win as a team, we lose as a team and we fell short,” the Scottish full-back said. “Of course he made mistakes but we are not blaming him. He has been incredible since he got the number one jersey. He is young and he will learn from it. He will be a top, top keeper. We have fallen short and there are no words that we can say to Loz that will make it better for him.”Robertson was one of many Liverpool players in Kiev who insisted that Salah’s cruel exit after 30 minutes, and not Karius’s mistakes, was the true turning point of the final. He also suggested, diplomatically as possible, that there was an element of intent behind Sergio Ramos’s prolonged hold on Liverpool’s leading goalscorer.“I think it is just how Mo has landed but Ramos is quite clever, isn’t he?” said Robertson, rhetorically. “It is just the way he has landed on it. It disrupted our rhythm a wee bit. Everyone looks because it is Mo Salah. He has done unbelievable this season and for it to end that way for him was devastating.”Lovren concurred: “We are devastated, it’s heartbreaking. Mo is one of the most important players for us and it’s not the same when you don’t have him on the pitch. The mindset is totally different when you have him on the pitch. It was difficult to accept that we, again, had such an unlucky moment with so many injuries. I cannot believe we had so many injuries this season.”The Liverpool captain, Jordan Henderson, described his second defeat in a European final for the club as “the worst feeling I have had in football”. But he was adamant the consistent progress Liverpool have made under Klopp would not be disrupted by the latest setback and silverware under the German coach will materialise.“I believe we will be in another Champions League final,” Henderson said. “I believe we will be challenging in all competitions domestically. The Premier League is important to us and we are qualified for the Champions League next year so we need to do it sooner rather than later. I believe in this team, I believe in this manager and I believe we are going in the right direction. It is so difficult to stand here now and say that but that is the truth. It is how I feel. We have to make it happen.”"

Discarded by José Mourinho and revived by Jürgen Klopp, the little Egyptian wizard is an Anfield legend in the making. His impact since his return to England has been extraordinary and it is staggering to think that Roma only received £36.9m from Liverpool. Salah has torn defences to shreds, scoring over 40 goals in all competitions, and Real Madrid will not enjoy trying to contain the 25-year-old in the Champions League final. His speed is terrifying, his left foot is a wand and his end product has improved beyond belief. A fitting winner of the PFA and FWA Footballer of the Year awards. Pep Guardiola caused plenty of consternation amongst English football’s commentariat when he discarded Joe Hart last season, especially when the replacement for England’s erstwhile No 1 turned out to be made out of sand. Yet those who argued that Hart had been treated unfairly just because of Claudio Bravo’s failings were looking at it the wrong way. Guardiola did not have to let go of his preference for a sweeper-keeper who was comfortable in possession. Instead he stuck to his guns and found an upgrade in Ederson, whose excellence has enhanced City’s defensive power and demonstrated that there is no need for Guardiola to compromise his ideals to suit the Premier League. Quite the opposite, in fact.This time last year the Scot had just been relegated with Hull City. Now he is preparing to face Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Isco and all the rest in the Champions League final. It has been quite the ride for the 24-year-old, who has been outstanding since cementing himself as Klopp’s favoured pick at left-back. Robertson was a snip at £8m and, while much of the focus has gone on Liverpool’s wondrous front three, he made himself a Kop cult hero with a demented surge in the 4-3 win over City in January. Some youngsters would have struggled to cope with the pressure of moving to such a big club, but Robertson has taken it all in his stride – and knocked a few opposition right-wingers over along the way. The German was the most creative player in the Bundesliga last season, laying on 95 chances for his Ingolstadt team-mates, and he has proved a canny purchase by Chris Hughton. Gross scored Brighton’s first ever goal in the Premier League, got his seventh of the season with the winner against Manchester United, contributed eight assists and won the club’s player of the season award. Not bad for a player who only cost £3m. Burnley certainly saw them coming when Watford came knocking for Andre Gray last summer. Gray has scored five goals since leaving for £18m, while Sean Dyche was able to use the money to replace the striker with Chris Wood. The New Zealand international did not come cheap – Leeds United received £15m – but Wood has had a fine season since arriving at Turf Moor. The burly forward marked his debut by scoring a late equaliser against Tottenham and his nine league goals have helped Burnley qualify for Europe for the first time since 1967, proving that there is value in targeting players in the lower leagues.

When Anna and Ronnie Ellis each parted with £450 for a seat on an “executive” coach from Liverpool to Kiev, they were expecting a few little luxuries for the 30-hour journey to the Champions League football final. Plug sockets, a toilet, maybe even a TV. Somewhere to store their bags that wasn’t their own laps would have been nice. But the minibus that pulled up outside the Arkles pub in Anfield on Thursday was a little more … rustic. Let’s just say the jerry can a fellow passenger had brought with him from work “for emergencies” was likely to be in high demand on the 2,750km-journey to the Ukrainian capital. Given the number of pints sunk in the pub beforehand, it may well have been full by the time the bus trundled on to the M62. Yet the cheerful couple were determined to make the best of things. “There was no way we were going to miss the match,” said Anna, white wine in hand.At least their transport showed up. A thousand other Liverpool fans found themselves stuck at John Lennon airport on Thursday when the air traffic controllers in Kiev decided they weren’t going to be able to cope with all the extra flights and denied three Scouse planes a landing slot. Onboard the minibus from the Arkles, not everyone had managed to wangle one of Liverpool’s 16,000 tickets for the match against 12-times Champions League winners Real Madrid – including organiser Martin Cleary and his 17-year-old son, Lewis Francis Cleary (“His initials are LFC – my missus is an Evertonian so I had to register him when she was still under sedation”). Father and son were confident of getting inside Kiev’s Olympic stadium, even if they got burnt last time they bought from the secondary market. “We paid £600 for e-tickets for the [Champions League qualifying] game against [Slovenian side] Maribor and when we got there they were blank, fakes,” said Cleary, who has planned for the bus to turn back around at 2am on Sunday, pretty much straight after the match. Jess Handley, 23, who was travelling alone, was unfazed by the journey ahead. “It’s the chance of a lifetime. You’ve got to grab it,” she said. Her mum, along to wave her off with her nana and granddad, was less sure. “How will she ring me to say she’s OK if she can’t charge her phone?” A few doors down at John’s Supper bar, a popular post-match chippy, the owner John Paraskeva was preparing for Saturday night, when 30,000 fans are expected to watch the game on screens at the stadium five minutes walk away. He had sourced a lifesize cutout of Mo Salah, the Egyptian king of Anfield, and was making a big vat of curry sauce to pour over chips for £1.50 a cone. “I tried to get tickets in the ballot to go to Kiev but I didn’t get any, so I’ll make the best of things here,” he said, still excited about Sadio Mané, Liverpool’s star winger, pulling up in his Porsche outside after the penultimate game of the season. “I offered him free chips but he said he had to look after his diet.” Outside the stadium, merchandise stalls were doing a brisk trade, with anything Salah-related most in demand. Buying flags for her car, Elizabeth Wright, 66, was another fan of the Egyptian striker. “People are now going to mosques because of him. He’s bringing harmony – that’s nice, isn’t it? I might go to mosque on Sunday. Are mosques open on Sundays?”In Liverpool city centre, many businesses are capitalising on the match by upping their prices on Saturday night. The German-themed Bierkeller is selling tickets for £20 a pop and most hotels have tripled their usual prices.Gareth Roberts, the editor of the Anfield Wrap, a Liverpool FC podcast and fanzine, said it was “a bit grim” how much profiteering was going on in his home city. Those charging silly prices may regret it in the long-term, he suggested: “It leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I think a lot of fans will be choosing their bars more carefully in future.”He said he had been contacted by fans from all over the world who couldn’t get tickets to Kiev so were descending on Liverpool instead. “When they’re being fleeced like this it doesn’t give the best impression of Liverpool,” he said. “It’s a tax on the passion of football.”Back at the Arkles, manager Carl Baines said they were treating it as an ordinary match day. “We’re not going to charge fans to come and watch the biggest game of the season.”"

The former England captain John Terry will leave Aston Villa this summer. Terry signed a one-year deal at Villa Park last July and made 35 league appearances, the last coming on Saturday in the play-off final defeat against Fulham.A club statement read: “Aston Villa can confirm the club will part company with John Terry. We would like to place on record our most sincere thanks for the effort and professionalism he showed with us last season.“John is a true leader and was everything and more that we hoped. Hugely popular and influential in the dressing room, he played a real captain’s role in creating the incredible bond the players shared with our supporters, and vice-versa.“We hope he looks back on his time with Villa fondly and we wish him the very best as his career moves forward.”Terry later added on Instagram: “Today I part ways with Aston Villa Football Club. I’m very proud to have had the opportunity to play and captain this great and huge club. I have given my everything this year both on and off the pitch and I’m still hurting today that we never managed to get back to the Premier League, where this club 100% belongs.“I would like to thank Steve Bruce who was instrumental in me joining Villa, I have learnt so much from him as a manager this season that will stay with me forever. Also, I’d like to thank all the staff and players who it was a real pleasure and honour to work with everyday.“Finally, a special thank you to the Villa supporters who have supported us both home and away in their thousands, up and down the country and have been amazing to me on a personal level. Villa will always have a place in my heart and I will look back on my time here and think about how close we were to reaching our goal. But now going forward, I would like to wish the management, staff, players and supporters good luck for the future.”Ipswich have confirmed the appointment of Paul Hurst as their manager in place of the departed Mick McCarthy.Hurst has left Shrewsbury Town, whom he guided to the League One play-off final after achieving their highest league position in 27 years.“Following what has been an exhaustive search I am delighted to announce Paul Hurst as our new manager,” the Ipswich owner, Marcus Evans, said. “His skill, experience and reputation enhanced by his recent success at Shrewsbury had placed him, from the start of the process, on my shortlist of candidates.”The appointment comes less than a week after the Shrews’ unexpectedly successful league campaign came to a disappointing end with defeat against Rotherham at Wembley.Shrewsbury’s chairman, Brian Caldwell, had accused the Championship club of making an “illegal approach” for Hurst, despite then granting permission for the two parties to speak.Hurst, a former Rotherham defender who will be joined by his assistant Chris Doig at Portman Road, guided Grimsby back into the Football League in 2010."

Manchester City’s quest for 100 points come up against a Southampton side who are all but safe but technically still need a draw, after four away points in a week and with a 10-goal swing required if Swansea finally manage a win. Mark Hughes would give his prospects of staying an added boost with a return against the club who sacked him in 2009 and he has urged Saints to make a quick decision for next season. “It’s a well-run club, good club, and a good opportunity for whoever gets it,” said Hughes who arrived only in March. If City win they will set more records, however, for the most away wins in a Premier League season with 16, and the most points on the road, 50. “In the last few weeks these numbers have helped us keep focus,” said Guardiola, whose players secured the title on 15 April.

Gareth Southgate has made the sensible decision to name his World Cup squad early, this coming week in fact, perhaps because of his close proximity to the furniture rearranging that took place when Glenn Hoddle trimmed Paul Gascoigne from his list at the last moment in 1998.As Southgate has explained, injuries permitting there is no need to prolong anyone’s agony when you have a couple of weeks to spare and a reasonable idea of the group you would like to select. Better to let everyone know the good or bad news early and give the individuals in the finalised squad as much time as possible to get to know each other.Southgate has already been unlucky in losing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joe Gomez to injury. Both Liverpool players were virtual certainties to make the trip. Oxlade-Chamberlain on account of his tremendous form since moving from Arsenal, Gomez because of his versatility and ability to play in a back three. That may not be the way England actually line up, at least not all of the time, though the player who can happily provide cover in a couple of positions is always a bonus to a manager looking to leave himself as many options as a squad of 23 will permit.England at the moment are a young squad, with few seasoned internationals absolutely demanding selection, and for that reason Southgate may feel able to resist the temptation to include one or two names for the future simply to increase their experience.Jadon Sancho and Ademola Lookman, the two starlets breaking through in the Bundesliga, have both been mentioned, though the circumstances are not quite the same as when Sven-Göran Eriksson took a 17-year-old Theo Walcott to Germany in 2006. Back then the team virtually picked itself, everyone knew pretty much how it would line up and, having been preferred to strikers of the quality of Jermain Defoe and Darren Bent, Walcott failed to manage a minute on the pitch in the World Cup. He was put back with the under-21s by the next manager, Steve McClaren, and ended up missing out on the 2010 finals under Fabio Capello when he boasted vastly more experience.Sometimes the best of intentions do not always produce the desired results and Southgate may feel, with players such as Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Marcus Rashford under consideration, that he is doing enough for the future in any case.The flip side of the youth policy is what might be termed the elder statesman question. As already mentioned England do not have too many of those but Southgate is believed to be willing to name Joe Hart among his three goalkeepers, even though the most experienced international at his disposal is unlikely to be first choice.Martin Keown famously retired from international football after Brazil knocked England out of the 2002 World Cup in Japan, and who could blame him? In the later stages of his career he had been selected for the 1998 and 2002 tournaments by two different managers and failed to kick a ball in either.If Jack Butland and Jordan Pickford are the first two goalkeeping names on the list, surely it would do no harm to further Nick Pope’s encouraging development rather than take Hart along as unrequired back-up. Similarly, if Gary Cahill and Chris Smalling are unlikely to be first-team choices, it might be better to make up the numbers with an Alfie Mawson or a James Tarkowski, defenders presently on the periphery of the squad but players who are likely to be around when the next World Cup comes along.So, on that basis, here is a suggested squad. The three goalkeepers who deserve to go are Butland, Pickford and Pope, although Southgate may prefer Hart to the Burnley player. Three centre-backs who seem certain to make the trip are John Stones, Harry Maguire and Phil Jones, and another Burnley player, Tarkowski, would be an adventurous fourth. Southgate must also consider the claims of Mawson, Cahill and Smalling for one place as extra defensive cover, though Michael Keane has probably slipped off the radar after an unimpressive first season at Everton.England are pretty well off for full-backs even without Gomez, so much so that they can afford to ignore the fact that Danny Rose has fallen from favour at Tottenham. Rose may still get the call but few would argue if Kyle Walker, Kieran Trippier, Ryan Bertrand and Alexander-Arnold were the quartet boarding the plane.In midfield the big question is whether to take Jack Wilshere, now that Oxlade-Chamberlain has pulled out. While there are doubts over the Arsenal player’s fitness record, Southgate seems unconvinced by the claims of Jonjo Shelvey. There is also the debate over whether Raheem Sterling and Dele Alli should be regarded as midfielders or strikers, though little doubt that both will be going. So should Jesse Lingard, and one has the feeling that Southgate will allow as much time as possible for Adam Lallana to prove his fitness.The manager has hinted there will be no surprises, so that probably means Wilshere is in and Shelvey out, though it does not necessarily rule out a call-up for Loftus-Cheek. Five options for midfield might be Jordan Henderson, Eric Dier, Wilshere, Lallana and Lingard, and five for up front would be Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy, Sterling, Alli and Rashford. That leaves one spare place, which could go to Loftus-Cheek at the expense of an extra striker in Danny Welbeck.Possible squad Butland, Pickford, Pope; Walker, Trippier, Bertrand, Alexander-Arnold; Stones, Maguire, Jones, Smalling, Tarkowski; Henderson, Dier, Lallana, Lingard, Wilshere, Loftus-Cheek; Kane, Alli, Vardy, Rashford, Sterling."
football,"Midfielder was 14 when his dad died in a crash but his response has taken him to Inter and caught Antonio Conte’s eyePablo Benítez

This article is part of the Guardian’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.Matías Vecino was 14 when he lost his father, the man who taught him the secrets of football. With the support of his family he has recovered to conquer Italy and grab the attention of Óscar Tabárez.It had been a long and difficult journey, from the trips from his childhood home in San Jacinto to train with his first club, Central Español, 50km away in Montevideo, to his debut in their senior side, his transfer to Nacional, and eventually to Italy and international recognition. Along the way he has been inspired by memories of his father, whose signature is tattooed on his right hand. On 1 August 2017 he opened a new chapter of a remarkable story by moving to one of Europe’s great clubs. On the day he was introduced as Internazionale’s latest signing he turned to his mother and asked: “What would Dad say if he saw me here?”Mario Vecino was also a footballer, whose career peaked with a spell in the Uruguayan top flight with Liverpool. When he died, killed in a car crash on his way to work, Vida Nueva, the local club in San Jacinto, renamed their ground the Estadio Municipal Mario Vecino in his honour. “That night I gathered the family around the table and told them what had happened,” says his mother, Dolly. “But we all got on with our lives, because the family was strong and we did not just sit down to cry or look for pity.” At one point Dolly, an English teacher, was doing three jobs in an effort to support her family.Dolly still lives in San Jacinto with her younger son, Nicolas. Her daughter, two years older than Matías is a lawyer. “Nicolas was the one most affected by the death of his father,” she says. “For months he was looking for him. He thought it was his dad every time someone knocked on the door or the phone rang. He was two and a half years old.”Matías had taken his first steps into the world of football as a four-year-old, when he joined his local kids’ team, with his father as coach. “Mario spent hours teaching him,” says Dolly. “He didn’t want Matías to win, he wanted his kid to learn.”He was taken on by Central Español and travelled every day to train in Montevideo. When he returned home he would give his grandmother Esther his white football boots and she would clean them for the next day. “They were the only boots he had and they are something that reminds him of how far he has travelled to get where he is today,” his mother says.“There were days when I would see him heading out with his little backpack on, walking in heavy rain, and I’d ask him: ‘Are you sure training’s going to be on?’” his uncle Raul Falero remembers. “And he’d say to me: ‘We’ll find a way.’”Daniel Sánchez was the manager at Central Español when Vecino made his debut in 2010. “When I first joined the club to work with the under-15s, he was already there,” he says. “Then I was head of youth and finally first-team coach. When Matías was in the under-20s his coach told me he was the best player he had.”Eventually he was promoted alongside Diego Riolfo, the other star of the club’s youth system, a striker who plays in the Argentinian top flight for Godoy Cruz. It was a difficult time for the Palermitanos, who were fighting relegation. On 6 March 2010 Vecino made his debut, playing the final half-hour of a 4-1 win over Tacuarembó.“In his first few games we played him in a more attacking role, to free him of responsibilities,” Sánchez says. “But game by game he was becoming more integral to our tactics, and he kept his place in the team.”He was called up to represent his country at junior level, and played in the 2011 South American under-20 championship in Peru, where he scored the goal that earned his country a place at the 2012 Olympics. “He told me that he didn’t want to be remembered for that goal,” his mother says. “He wanted to continue writing his story.”His performances in Peru earned him a move to Nacional, and after 18 months there he was bought by Fiorentina. In Italy he had loan spells at Cagliari and Empoli and it was at Empoli, under the guidance of Maurizio Sarri, that he flourished, playing as one of two defensive midfielders. His performances were so impressive that Antonio Conte, then the manager of Italy, tried to convince him to take citizenship of his adoptive country. “He told me that it didn’t feel right, and he wanted to wait for the chance to play for Uruguay,” says his mother.In March 2016 that opportunity arrived. He was in the starting lineup as Uruguay went 2-0 down to Brazil in Recife before fighting back to draw 2-2. “I couldn’t have been more nervous,” says his mother. “There’s no way I would have missed it. I’ve seen every one of his debuts.” Unless injured or suspended, he has played for his country in every game since.His final appearance of the season for Inter came at Lazio on the last day, a match in effect a winner-takes-all Champions League qualifier. The Nerazzurri twice came from behind, and in the 81st minute Vecino headed the winner to take his club into Europe’s premier club competition for the first time since 2012. “I haven’t scored that many goals,” he said, “but this is the most important of my career.”His story, however, has a few chapters still to be written.Pablo Benítez writes for El Observador.

football,"Arsène Wenger’s departure from Arsenal means Exeter City boss Paul Tisdale will become the longest-serving manager in English football – although he might be on his way tooBy Richard Foster for The Agony and the Ecstasy

As Arsène Wenger prepares to say goodbye to Arsenal, the man who will take his place as the longest-serving manager in English football is focused on securing a third promotion in his 12 seasons at Exeter City. Tisdale has led his team into the play-offs four times – including their disappointing defeat to Blackpool in the League Two final last season – so they will know what to expect when they take on Lincoln City in the play-offs semi-finals this week.Tisdale took over at St James Park in June 2006, a month after Wenger had taken his team to Paris for the Champions League final against Barcelona. Wenger had already spent a glorious decade at Arsenal, winning three Premier League titles and four FA Cups, including the Double in 1998 and the Invincibles season in 2004.Away from the glitz and glamour of top-flight football, Tisdale started his coaching career in the West Country in 2000 with a team of students – Le Professeur would approve. Tisdale took over as player-coach of Team Bath, a name he coined for the club that had been set up to represent the city’s university.The move was a big change for Tisdale, who had played for Southampton in the Premier League, for FinnPa in Finland and for Greek side Panionios in the Cup Winners’ Cup quarter-finals. His first assignment for Team Bath was a visit to Tunley Athletic but, with a side mainly made up of students and a smattering of semi-professionals, they took the bold move to join the non-league pyramid and secured four promotions.Starting off in the Western League Division One, the 10th tier, they immediately gained promotion to the Western League’s Premier Division and a couple of years later were promoted to the Southern League. Along the way they also appeared in the first round of the FA Cup in 2002, narrowly losing out to Mansfield Town, and becoming the first student team to make it that far since Oxford University in 1880.Tisdale’s achievements came to the attention of the Exeter City owners and they offered him a job in 2006. The club were not exactly a model of financial stability or managerial longevity, having worked their way through 12 managers in as many years before Tisdale arrived. Their relegation from the Football League in 2003 had hit them hard, the club almost falling into insolvency before a group of supporters set up their own trust and made Exeter one of the growing band of fan-owned clubs in British football.Buoyed by the improvement in the club’s finances, Tisdale led them to the Conference National play-offs in his first season. They lost to Morecambe in the final but, undeterred, they reached the final again the following season and beat Cambridge United to return to League Two.Not content with taking the club back into the Football League for the first time in five years, Tisdale went on to achieve a rare double by securing a second successive promotion to League One. This time they did not need the play-offs, finishing second behind champions Brentford to reach the third tier for the first time in 15 years. After three seasons in League One, the club fell back into the fourth tier, where they have stayed for the last six years playing an attractive, passing style of football.One of those dozen managers who preceded Tisdale in the job was former Tottenham player Steve Perryman, who took over as caretaker boss for two games in 2004. More significantly, he was the man responsible for bringing Tisdale to the club a couple of years later. Tisdale has benefited from having Perryman alongside him as a mentor, ally and one of the more durable directors of football in England.The pair have brought a raft of young players through the academy, providing much-needed revenue when they are sold on up the pyramid. Perryman will retire at the end of this season and he is rightly proud of what they have achieved in recent years. “Football is taking notice of it,” he said earlier this year. “They know this is a serious football club now – albeit a small club, albeit lacking any financial power, but there’s a power in the environment we have here to all work together and work to improve.”Tisdale will become English football’s longest-serving manager this weekend but he may not hold the record for long. There is speculation he could be following Perryman out the door, perhaps even to take the vacant post at MK Dons. Tisdale’s contract is up for renewal in November and he is “keeping his options open” as he waits to see how Exeter perform in the play-offs. If Tisdale does say goodbye to Exeter City, the title of longest-serving manager will be passed on to Jim Bentley, who has just kept Morecambe in the Football League on goal difference. When asked about his position last week, Bentley said: “Who knows what the future holds? I might not be here myself next year.” Watch this space.• This article is from the author of The Agony and the Ecstasy• Follow Richard Foster on Twitter"

I invested a lot in my fitness. My personal network [of therapists] cost me 10% of my net salary, several hundreds of thousands of euros. But it was absolutely the right decision and it paid off as after two seasons I extended my contract by a further three years. I wouldn’t have been able to play for a top club for seven years in the Premier League without these additional therapies.My experience has taught me that you simply cannot do enough. For example, I was a big fan of yoga from the beginning because I had seen that it improved stability and flexibility.Even at the age of 33 I was one of the most flexible at Arsenal when it came to my back muscles. Hardly anyone came to the yoga sessions that the club offered. Often there were only four of us: Héctor Bellerín, Nacho Monreal and Tomas Rosicky.The youth players who were promoted to the first team smiled at these exercises. They thought we were meditating. They were happy with the ball at their feet but for everything else there was a lack of desire. “I play football and go to training. That’s enough.”But no, it isn’t enough when you want to maintain a certain level for a long time or want to improve.Either you are learning from scratch, from your parents and the teachers and coaches around you, to take responsibility, or you don’t do it at all. This is the kind of dumbing down we must fight against.In the autumn of 2017 an under-18 player came and asked whether we could sit down for a chat. I nearly fell over, I was so surprised. That hadn’t happened in the six and a half years I had been there. He wanted to speak to me about leadership.I used a lot of energy trying to convince team-mates they should do more for their bodies and try new things. But working long term to improve their weaknesses? Hardly anyone.When I injured myself against Sunderland [in the 2011-12 season] I started working with Lars Lienhard. A former athlete, he is a sports scientist as well as a pioneer when it comes to neurally controlled training.Working with him was a huge success. We always assume that we can run and see properly because nothing hurts. But that is a mistake. Lars showed me that our eyes are a big factor in everything, above all when it comes to our timing.On my right side my timing was super but I had the feeling my left eye was not really up for it. Why was that? And was it possible to train and improve [the left eye] so that I didn’t have to turn my whole body in order to look left? It all meant that in 50% of the times the ball came towards me my brain said: “Hey, I can’t really see that ball so I’m not going to jump for it.”And as my left eye was not really looking at the ball I was always twisting my neck to use my dominant right eye.Football doesn’t really deal with those things, despite the fact they can be decisive. Players would rather lift weights, stand on their own with their dumbbells – but how does that help me on the pitch?During the exercises with Lars one could see quite clearly that my eyes were moving differently when an object was approaching me. My left eye always remained in the middle rather than focusing on the object.He showed me how to make my left eye stronger. I had a patch on my right eye, forcing my left eye to focus on the objects. And after a few weeks I could really notice the difference in games. If there was a high ball from the left I had a much better feeling for where it would end up.With Lars’s help I stayed injury-free for four and a half years. Meeting him changed my life as a footballer.The important thing was to do exercises myself before games as well to adjust the eyes. One example was a kind of push-up for the eyes. You bring a pencil in towards your nose and force your eyes towards the middle. When you do that at the training ground a lot of people think: “What is he doing now? Is he completely stupid?”Mainly I was doing it at home or in the hotel room. I had six or seven exercises that I did, sometimes just before kick-off in the dressing room. I didn’t care what the others thought or if they laughed. But you saw again that something new, something unknown, led to laughter rather than people asking: “What are you doing there?”Footballers are used to working only three hours a day. And out of the three hours they are at the training ground they are on their mobiles for half of that.We have all the money in the world but do not realise how important the body is. A player on average has a seven‑year professional career, 10-15 if everything goes right. You have to do everything possible to be at your maximum.A lot of players don’t even know what maximum is – for them it is about having fun on the pitch. But there is more to being a professional than that.In my new role as Arsenal academy manager I will do everything I can to challenge the young players’ mindsets. I want to challenge them so that they are ready to take on new ideas and protect them from being injured, when it comes to their body and soul.I want to convince them they have to do something to get to the top of the world and I want to be an example for them. For me there wasn’t really a way up but somehow I made it there anyway, because I did everything I possibly could to give me the best chances to succeed. Talent is what you make of your situation.This is an edited extract from Weltmeister ohne Talent by Per Mertesacker (with Raphael Honigstein), which was released in German on 11 May and published by Ullstein Verlag"

Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah will be fit to feature in the World Cup group stages, according to the Egyptian Football Association.The forward looked unlikely to play any part in the summer tournament after sustaining a shoulder injury in the first half of Liverpool’s 3-1 defeat against Real Madrid in the Champions League final on Saturday night before leaving the field in tears.The EFA president, Hani Abu Reda, the national team coach Hector Cuper and doctor Mohamed Abou El-Ela met Salah on Wednesday in Valencia, where the 25-year-old is undergoing treatment and rehabilitation.A post on the federation’s Facebook page read: “The delegation of the national team was briefed on the recovery programme for the player, who is walking well and aims to join the squad in the World Cup, as well as the determination of the great player to catch up with his team-mates. For his part, Mohamed Abou El-Ela said that the period of absence of Salah due to injury will not exceed three weeks.”Egypt’s opening World Cup match takes place on 15 June against Uruguay, with their second against the hosts Russia coming four days later. Should Salah not return in time for either of those games, he could still appear in Egypt’s final group match against Saudi Arabia on 25 June."

Jack Butland was “gutted” for Joe Hart after the Manchester City goalkeeper was omitted from England’s World Cup squad, with the Stoke No 1 texting commiserations to a player he considers a hero.Hart, who spent last season on loan at West Ham, played in the majority of England’s qualifiers for Russia 2018 but was then excluded by Gareth Southgate for the finals. Butland, who will now compete with Jordan Pickford and Nick Pope for the starting jersey, said: “We all thought, ‘Wow’. It was a gutsy decision from the manager. I’ve spoken to Joe. I know he’s devastated to miss out.“I texted him once the squad had been announced and said ‘I’m absolutely gutted for you’. He’s been my hero since I was 14 years old and I still look up to him. It was important for me to tell him that because you don’t often get opportunities to tell people what you really think about them.”Butland first met his hero at Birmingham City when Hart was on loan there in 2009-10. “When I was coming through at Birmingham – him as a goalkeeper, him as a person, I admired him,” he added.“I wanted to be where he was, I wanted to be the No 1 for Birmingham and the No 1 for England and he was all those things. As we’ve got older, certainly the last couple of years, I’ve seen and learned more from Joe than I ever could have thought.“What he’s been through and the humility that he’s dealt with things … despite everything that’s gone on. He’s always been the first one to congratulate whoever’s played. That shows more about Joe as a person and character than any of the saves or great performances he’s had throughout his career.”"

The consensus suggests this will be Antonio Conte’s last Premier League game in charge of Chelsea. Can he use it to somehow secure a top-four finish? Newcastle fans must trust this is not Rafael Benítez’s Tyneside swansong. The negotiations between their widely coveted manager and Mike Ashley over extending a contract that has only a year to run remain delicate. Expect the Gallowgate End to, not for the first time, repeatedly sing “Rafa Benítez, we want you to stay.” Chelsea meanwhile are monitoring Newcastle’s much improved centre-half Jamaal Lascelles. He could be key to Benítez’s team ending a run of four straight defeats as they struggle to retain their grip on 10th place.

Jamie Maclaren’s hopes of playing at the World Cup have been revived after the striker was called into Bert van Marwijk’s Socceroos squad as cover for Tomi Juric, who is suffering from a knee complaint.Maclaren, arguably Australia’s most in-form forward with under three weeks to go before the start of competition in Russia, was initially left out of the 26-man squad announced by Van Marwijk for a training camp in Turkey.The Dutchman’s squad will be further trimmed to a final 23 before a 4 June deadline. Maclaren ended the season strongly for Hibernian in the Scottish Premier League, scoring a hat-trick against Rangers on the final day of the season before Van Marwijk announced he had cut him from the extended Australian squad.Maclaren now has another opportunity to put his case forward for inclusion in the group that will travel to Russia, with a friendly game against the Czech Republic lined up in Austria on 1 June.“Tomi Juric has had a knee issue over the last three weeks, which is being monitored by our medical team,” Van Marwijk said. “We hope that Tomi will be able to train and play this week, but his recovery might also take longer. “That is why we have decided to bring in Jamie Maclaren now so that he also has a fair chance to display his qualities before the final 23-player squad must be announced.”Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every dayJuric was expected to lead the Socceroos’ line, but fears over his fitness lay bare the paucity of cover in that position – Van Marwijk’s list of 26 included just two out-and-out strikers in Juric and Tim Cahill. Thirty-eight-year-old Cahill is seeking to become just the fourth player in history to score at four World Cups, but is likely to have to do so as a substitute. An enforced absence for Juric would leave Australia looking to the likes of Mat Leckie, Robbie Kruse, Andrew Nabbout or Nikita Rukavytsya to fill an unfamiliar role.Once the final squad has been announced, Van Marwijk will send his side out in one more friendly, against Hungary in Budapest on 10 June, before they start their Group C campaign against France in Kazan six days later.Games against Denmark in Samara and Peru in Sochi follow."

Karren Brady is facing pressure to drop her weekly column with the Sun after writing that “malcontents and keyboard warriors” have undermined West Ham’s efforts to make improvements to the London Stadium.It is understood that West Ham’s vice-chairman has been repeatedly urged from within the club to end her association with the newspaper, amid weariness at the problems that some consider certain columns to have caused West Ham. As reported by the Guardian, according to a source remarks Brady made in an article last year scuppered a deal to sign Islam Slimani from Leicester City in January. Her latest comments have been met with a furious response from supporters.Brady received a vote of no confidence from the West Ham United Independent Supporters’ Association before Sunday’s game against Everton at the London Stadium. It has demanded that she does not write for the Sun any more.Passions were stirred when Brady made reference to the London Stadium’s problems in her review of the season on Saturday. West Ham have struggled to settle in their new ground since leaving Upton Park two years ago and supporters mounted angry protests at the club’s board during the home defeat by Burnley two months ago.“We have some problems at the London Stadium caused to a degree by the terms of our lease, which we are tackling, but also by malcontents and keyboard warriors,” Brady wrote. She did not respond when asked by the Guardian to whom she was referring. Nor did Brady or West Ham respond to a further request for comment.According to a source, her remark has not impressed senior figures at West Ham. However Brady has offered no indication that she will shelve the column, even though it appears to have caused friction inside and outside the club.Attempts to sign Slimani were hindered, according to a source, because Brady offended Leicester’s owners with comments about the club’s chairman, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. Although Brady and West Ham apologised, Leicester refused to consider a deal for Slimani in the last transfer window. The Algerian striker joiner Newcastle United on loan instead."

Certain grubby newspaper editors would pay fortunes for dirt on Raheem Sterling, yet pretty much all they can dig up to sling at him is stuff he himself chooses to share. That alone suggests he’s alright. There is, of course, plenty of other evidence indicating Sterling is a force for good – his thrilling play, for starters, or his philanthropic acts or the bright-shining example he offers of a youngster from a tough background achieving success through talent and discipline. But certain grubby newspaper editors don’t want you to read about that. We have to read between the lines to figure out why.There was, of course, an eye-rolling inevitability to the Sun’s decision to devote its front page today to commentary on the new tattoo that Sterling decided to reveal to the world yesterday. The Sun most righteously disapproved of it and, in fairness, few creatures are better qualified than the editors of The Sun to offer analysis of abominations committed to ink. Sterling’s tattoo appears to be of a M16 rifle. Getting it done was obviously a vile deed too far from a man whose previous form includes buying a house and driving a car.This time the Sun had to take a stand, especially as the dozing Daily Mail seemed to have fallen asleep on the job. The organ duly found an anti-gun campaigner to blast Sterling’s “sick” drawing, demanding he be axed from England’s World Cup squad unless he gets the offending image lasered off. The Sun’s anger was presumably intensified by the fact that they forgot to barf something similar last week when one of Britain’s feudal overlords got married in full military regalia (although not German, this time).Sterling has shown in the past that he is strong enough to ignore tabloid hypocrisy but this time he decided to educate, one of the best ways of eradicating prejudice. “When I was 2 my father died from being gunned down to death,” the 23-year-old explained on social media. “I made a promise to myself I would never touch a gun in my life. I shoot with my right foot so it has as deeper meaning [and] still unfinished.” Sterling’s leg is his weapon, then. And he uses it a lot better than certain grubby newspaper editors use their arms. “Franz Beckenbauer said I was possibly the closest he had seen to a player like himself at that age. That was quite a compliment. But I always say that it goes to show, even Beckenbauer can talk some amount of sh!te” – RIP Neale Cooper, a fine footballer with a nice sideline in self-deprecating humour.Yes, it’s our not-singing, not-dancing World Cup Fiver.

Manuel Pellegrini has said he wants to play football that will delight the fans but nobody will be smiling if West Ham’s defending does not improve. David Moyes settled on a 3-4-2-1 system because he did not trust his ponderous side to function properly in a more open formation. Yet it was a stop-gap manoeuvre and West Ham still finished with the Premier League’s joint-worst defensive record alongside relegated Stoke, conceding 68 goals. Pellegrini will need to sort out that weakness before thinking about a more expansive style. There have been too many humiliations in the past two seasons.Adrián is the only senior goalkeeper, there is not enough energy in midfield or cover in defence, Michail Antonio and Andy Carroll are rarely fit, Moyes had nobody to play on the right wing, there is too much reliance on Marko Arnautovic and Manuel Lanzini and the bench was often filled by novices and free transfers last season. Pellegrini has spoken about making five signings but the squad requires more surgery. The question is how much money is available, though, and the Chilean will need to sell players. Sam Byram, Jordan Hugill and Reece Oxford, who is wanted by Borussia Mönchengladbach, could all go. Carroll and Javier Hernández should also be vulnerable.West Ham’s signings since moving to London Stadium in 2016 have largely been underwhelming and that has led to David Sullivan, the club’s influential co-owner, receiving a lot of criticism. However, Sullivan has handed Pellegrini control of transfers and West Ham are looking for a new head of recruitment. Málaga’s Mario Husillos and Leicester City’s Eduardo Macià are potential appointments and whoever comes in must implement a more focused scouting system. West Ham are crying out for greater youth and intensity.The defender spent most of last season on loan at Mönchengladbach and has been a target for Red Bull Leipzig. Oxford enjoyed his time in Germany and was glad to return to the Bundesliga after being briefly recalled by Moyes over Christmas. Yet while Gladbach want to sign the 19-year-old in a £12m deal, Pellegrini should give a chance to a player who announced himself with a fine performance against Arsenal three years ago. Oxford is a versatile talent and although there have been doubts over his attitude, it is debatable whether West Ham should be willing to let one of their academy products leave.West Ham have struggled since leaving Upton Park and the board came in for fierce criticism during the home defeat by Burnley in March. With that in mind, perhaps Pellegrini’s experience at Málaga will be relevant. The former Manchester City manager dealt with a difficult owner at La Rosaleda and kept his players onside when money dried up, so he might know how to handle Sullivan. Yet whether Pellegrini’s appointment on a deal worth up to £7m a year represents value for money remains to be seen. The 64-year-old’s predecessors were undermined in the transfer market. Having made a big statement, though, Sullivan has to back it up."

This article is part of the Guardian’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.In the history of the World Cup, no player has appeared in the same team as his own son-in-law. And it won’t happen again this year, though it very nearly did. Last year Shadwa El-Hadary, daughter of Egypt’s goalkeeper and captain Essam, got engaged to the flying winger Mahmoud Abdel-Moneim, commonly known by the single name Kahraba (Electricity). Only 48 days later the relationship was over, after the young player was found to be already engaged to an actress, which must create a uniquely awkward dressing-room dynamic.This should not stop Essam El-Hadary from making history in Russia. Throughout his career he has had, more or less in the back of his mind, one “dream I want to make true”. This summer it is set to happen, more than 22 years after his international debut, when he is expected to make his first appearance at the World Cup and become the oldest player to play in the competition, at the age of 45.It has been a long journey, and not without drama, for the player nicknamed the High Dam after the popular Egyptian water-blocking barrier. He was born in January 1973 in a small town called Kafr al-Battikh – literally Town of the Watermelon – near Egypt’s Mediterranean coast. Despite its name the town is famed not for fruit but for the production of wooden furniture, and Essam’s father was a craftsman who owned a small workshop. He gave his young son an ultimatum: work hard at school or work hard making furniture. His child considered the two options, ignored him and played football instead.This he had to do in secret, taking his schoolbooks to the local playing fields so his parents would believe he was studying, and washing his dirty clothes in a nearby river so they would not discover how he was filling his days.It was on the local dirt pitches that the talented goalkeeper – comfortable on the ball, often playing outfield – was spotted by his local side in Kafr al-Battikh. At 17 he was snapped up by the Egyptian second division team Damietta. He played in their academy for a season before he summoned the courage to tell his father about his new career. Every day he would run the 7km from his home to training alongside his best friend who would keep him company on a bike.The 6ft 2in goalkeeper has a towering demeanour and attributes his strength and fearlessness to his uncomfortable beginnings. Before arriving at Damietta he had never worn goalkeeping gloves, and on his first day was handed a pair. On his second day he turned up without them, declaring that he wanted to keep training with bare hands, the way he always had. Suffering through the resulting cuts and bruises helped him to prepare for the aches and pains inevitably suffered by a professional footballer.He made his debut for Damietta in 1993 aged 20 and after an impressive first season was a shock call-up to the national team, albeit as the fifth-choice goalkeeper. He still did not have a car, so a neighbour drove him to the national team’s training camp in his 1970s Peugeot estate.At the end of his second season, with one year of his contract remaining, El-Hadary secretly signed a pre-contract with al-Ahly. By this time a number of teams had shown interest and he had to pretend he was still looking for a team until the campaign was over and he was free to make his agreed move.Essam spent 12 years at al-Ahly and established himself as one of the country’s best players and a fixture in the national team. He is a dominating and loud presence in goal, using his voice, physique and reputation to instil fear into the opposition. The Chelsea and Ivory Coast legend Didier Drogba, thwarted at his hands on multiple occasions in the Africa Cup of Nations, once proclaimed El-Hadary his most troublesome opponent.El-Hadary is famed in Egypt for celebrating big victories with a watermelon, in honour of his hometown, and for clambering on to the crossbar after notable successes and dancing, while his supporters chant “Oros ya Hadary” (“dance el-Hadary”). One such occasion was at the 2002 CAF Super Cup, when al-Ahly beat Kaizer Chiefs 4-1 with el-Hadary scoring his side’s third goal, the first of his career, with a free-kick from his own half (there has been one more, a stoppage-time penalty for the Saudi side Al-Taawoun in a victory over al-Ettifaq last year).In 2008 he controversially left al-Ahly to join the Swiss side Sion. He did so without telling his employers and despite being under contract; el-Ahly lodged a complaint with Fifa and he was banned for four months. He learned from this mistake: when Hull City tried to buy him after a trial in 2011 his then employers, the Sudanese club al-Merrikh, turned down their offer and he grudgingly returned to Africa.He made his international debut in 1996, 10 months before the youngest player in Egypt’s World Cup squad, Stoke’s 21-year-old winger Ramadan Sobhi, was born. There have been more than 150 appearances since, in which time he has won the Africa Cup of Nations four times, and been named that tournament’s best goalkeeper on three occasions.For Egypt he is the last remaining member of the golden generation that won a hat-trick of African Cup of Nations titles between 2006 and 2010. Even though he is coming to the end of his career, when he plays there is a sense of calm in the defence and he is regarded as a hero in Egypt for his ability to step up during important games. Russia this summer will be his greatest test of all, but also – whatever the outcome – his greatest triumph. “This is a message to all footballers and others around the world,” he says, “that you should believe in your dreams and fight to make them come true.”Ahmad Yousef writes for Kingfut.com.Follow him on Twitter here.Click here for our Egypt team guide."

The former Aston Villa and Bolton defender Jlloyd Samuel died in a car crash on Tuesday morning.“We are deeply saddened to hear of the death of our former player Jlloyd Samuel at the age of just 37 in a car accident,” Villa said on Twitter. “Our players will wear black armbands as a mark of respect tonight [in the Championship play-off semi-final against Middlesbrough] and our thoughts are with his friends and family at this very difficult time.”The Manchester United full-back Ashley Young tweeted: “Absolutely gutted to hear the news of the passing of Jlloyd Samuel. Took me under his wing when I joined Villa and helped me settle.”Samuel played 169 league games during nine years at Villa before joining Bolton in 2007, going on to make 71 league appearances over four years. He also had loan spells at Gillingham and Cardiff. Most recently he has been the player-manager of the non-league club Egerton.Samuel was capped by England from under-18 to under-21 level and was an unused substitute for a senior international against Sweden in 2004. He decided to represent Trinidad and Tobago, winning two caps. He also played club football in Iran between 2011 and 2015.The Trinidad and Tobago FA said in a statement: “We’ve received some terrible news that former national defender and ex-Aston Villa and Bolton Wanderers player Jlloyd Samuel died in a car crash this morning in England.“According to reports, Jlloyd was returning home after dropping his kids off to school and collided with an oncoming vehicle.“The Trinidad and Tobago FA and his former national team-mates at this time extends deepest condolences to his family members both in the UK and here in Trinidad and Tobago.”Born in San Fernando, Trinidad, Samuel moved to the UK as a youngster and attended school in Blackheath. He played for London Schoolboys and Charlton youth sides before signing for Villa.Cheshire police said they were called to a serious collision involving a van and a Range Rover in High Legh, Cheshire at 7:55am.“Sadly the driver of the car, Jlloyd Samuel, 37, from Lymm, died at the scene,” they said in a statement. “The driver of the van, a 54-year-old man, sustained serious injuries and has been taken to hospital.”"

In goal it has to be Jorge Campos. Like me, he played in three World Cups and also played in over 100 games for the Mexico national team. In my opinion, he was the best goalkeeper that Mexico has ever had.My first centre-back is Rafael Márquez because of what he has done in Europe with Barcelona, where he won four league titles and two European Cups. He has played over 140 games for the national team too – and he could feature in a fifth World Cup! Carlos Salcido was an extremely efficient centre-back and was so effective in over 120 appearances so he earns a place in my team. At right-back I would have the versatile Pável Pardo – he’s right behind me when it comes to the most caps for the national team – and to complete my defence I will pick Ramón Ramírez at left-back. He has done such important things with Mexico. He’s gone to World Cups, Gold Cups and won the 1999 Confederations Cup. He was one of the very best.My first midfielder is Andrés Guardado, for his consistency while playing in various World Cups and because he has already won over 140 caps with the national team at the age of 31. He’s always there when Mexico need him. Gerardo Torrado is one of my three midfielders. Over the years he has been a significant and influential ball-winning player. Alberto García Aspe is my other midfielder. Like Torrado, Aspe was also very consistent and another Mr Reliable for Mexico.Cuauhtémoc Blanco is my pick just behind the front two. For me, he is the most talented player that Mexico has ever had. He always gave everything for the national team, everything! He’s one of Mexico’s all-time great goalscorers.Javier Hernández is one of my centre-forwards. Chicharito continues to be a supremely able footballer and nowadays he is the player we look to in the national team to score the goals. A natural goalscorer and they are quite rare. The final player in my all-time XI is Hugo Sánchez. What a player. He played at such a high level for so many years and became a towering figure in Mexico for what he accomplished in Europe with Atlético Madrid and then Real Madrid, where his goals helped fire the team to five league titles. Incredible. "

Antonio Conte, clean‑shaven on the eve of the FA Cup final, digested the question, took a deep breath and then conjured a fresh analogy for an increasingly weary theme. “Last season was a wonderful season because we reached an important success,” the Chelsea head coach said, his mind retreating exactly 12 months to the raucous celebrations with the Premier League trophy on the pitch at Stamford Bridge. “But then you have to understand the way you won. If your car is going at 300km per hour, or if you are winning while going at normal velocity and aren’t risking burning out your engine.”The Italian’s audience was picking apart that metaphor when, for those still in the dark, he followed up with a dash of clarity. “When you win, you must understand which is the best way to improve. Last season we won and we divided [praise for] this big win with the players and the club. This season we finished fifth. We must divide the responsibility between the club, the manager and the players in the same way. If you are intelligent, you understand what is wrong and what is right. And you to try and improve.”The question, asked before the resumption of hostilities with José Mourinho and Manchester United, had been about whether defeat by Arsenal in last year’s Cup final had, in hindsight, provided glimpses of the unravelling which would follow. Whether Diego Costa’s post-match insistence that he would not be forced to China but would hold out for Atlético Madrid, or that glimpse of a team who had taken their eyes off the ball, were a portent of everything unsettling to come. It said much that Conte’s response, impressively inventive in his second language, was effectively a return to a default position.His sense of dissatisfaction at recruitment policy and perception that the board failed to build on last season’s success infected Chelsea through the second half of his tenure. The drip feed of negativity has lowered the collective mood. At times it is as if he has been goading Roman Abramovich, a notoriously trigger-happy owner. Quite possibly it was only the unpalatable prospect of a hefty compensation payout that stayed the owner’s hand, particularly after humiliations against Bournemouth and Watford. As it is he would have to fork out £9m to dispense with Conte’s services but there is a sense that the divorce is imminent.Chelsea are used to chopping and changing. Theirs has been a boom-and-bust approach under Abramovich, and it has still yielded a trophy haul the envy of virtually every club in the country. Those on the inside accept they can be the victims of the kind of emotive, forthright manager they tend to appoint, though Carlo Ancelotti and others might argue it is a tolerance of relative failure that has been lacking.What the board has to contemplate is whether it would be to Chelsea’s benefit to dispense with an elite coach who has claimed major reward at every club he has overseen since 2010 – a promotion with Siena, three Serie A titles at Juventus and, after two years with Italy, last season’s Premier League – transforming a side who had finished 10th into title winners with only three key additions. Can a club condemned to the Europa League attract a candidate of similar status? Probably. Is there scope financially to lure a Luis Enrique or Leonardo Jardim, Maurizio Sarri or Massimiliano Allegri, plus their respective entourages, while also meting out compensation? Maybe, at a push. It might be worth the cost just to be rid of the whingeing.Conte’s constant sniping infuriated Juventus’ hierarchy eventually, for all the club’s dominance in Serie A, though the head coach had a point this time. Adding Álvaro Morata, Tiémoué Bakayoko, Danny Drinkwater, Antonio Rüdiger, Davide Zappacosta and Willy Caballero to ranks depleted by the departures of Nathan Aké, John Terry, Asmir Begovic, Nathaniel Chalobah, Nemanja Matic and Costa hardly constituted bolstering options before a title defence and Champions League campaign. An opportunity was passed up once Chelsea balked at Mino Raiola’s fee to restore Romelu Lukaku to Stamford Bridge, or Juve’s £80m asking price for Alex Sandro.There had been fears of a parting even in the immediate aftermath of the title win. Relations became so strained over the summer that Conte’s backroom staff, who had mainly been living in short-term lets, moved into a local hotel while they waited to discover if they would be retained. An uneasy truce was secured, with a new contract on improved, if not extended, terms papering over the cracks.Even the midwinter additions of Ross Barkley, Emerson and Olivier Giroud did not serve to appease. “I’m a bit of a disaster to convince the club to buy players,” Conte said through a rueful smile in February. “I have to speak more with the managers who are very, very good at persuading their clubs to spend money to buy top players.” That was an interesting message to send to the new arrivals, the recruitment department and the director Marina Granovskaia, who had assumed Michael Emenalo’s duties.Then there was the regular damning of Chelsea with praise for Manchester City, whose emergence under Pep Guardiola, secured until 2021, threatens to block any short-term route to recovery. “They are a club that want to invest and improve,” he said last month. “They did a great job on and off the pitch; they were very well prepared for the season.”That unsettling sniping is unlikely to stop. If Granovskaia, with whom the Italian’s relationship is understood to have been particularly frosty at times, can secure someone more amenable to working within the relative financial constraints of Chelsea 2018 rather than Chelsea circa 2004 – Jardim perhaps – there would be fewer headaches all round. Thoughts drift back to the infamous text exchange between Conte and Costa. It was no secret the Italian hoped to be rid of the high-maintenance striker but those upstairs had not sanctioned him to communicate it so bluntly. It was as if he did not entirely trust the board to push through the sale, so forced the matter himself.The schism with Costa did not impress the players. Back in those celebratory scenes a year ago, there was a unity between staff and squad. The endless high-octane training had driven Chelsea, against the odds, to the title. This time round there is a sense of grumbling disquiet. The gruelling sessions left the team 30 points off City. In finishing 10th in 2016, Chelsea had been 31 points from the summit.Many were baffled by the six changes made against Huddersfield this month just as a semblance of momentum was building in the pursuit of the top four. David Luiz has hardly featured since questioning the management after a humiliation at Roma. Eden Hazard has not enjoyed his guest appearances as a false No 9. Willian, who has started once since a stroppy substitution in the Cup semi-final, was asked about his relationship with Conte by ESPN Brazil this week. “Oh boy, do you really want me to tell you?” he replied. “Well, let’s save it for our next interview.” Chelsea will be far more reluctant to lose Hazard or Willian than Conte.All of which suggests a change is in everyone’s interests. Claim the FA Cup and, with major trophies in each of his seasons in London, Conte’s reputation would hardly be tarnished. Asked on Friday how it had come to this, he drifted back into introspection. “I don’t know. My commitment for the club has always been the same. Maybe this season we even worked harder than last season. Last season I ... ‘we’ were heroes for Chelsea’s fans. Now our status, mine and the players, has changed? I don’t know. But, in my soul and my heart, I’m always a hero because I gave 120% to solve the problems.” Claiming the Cup would offer a triumphant exit of sorts. Some relationships simply have a shelf life."

And here come the 2018 Europa League winners: Atletico Madrid! Having lost a couple of Champions League finals in recent seasons, this is a huge release of emotion for quite a few of these players. Fernando Torres, of course, but this is the first trophy Antoine Griezmann has won for Atletico too. Gabi takes possession of the trophy and raises it ... generously allowing Torres to share the moment! The red-and-white ticker tape showers down, as the players bounce like they’ve never bounced before.Updated

A few of the Marseille players in tears, as you’d expect in these circumstances. But they’re magnanimous in defeat, too, embracing their opponents and offering congratulations. Plenty of smiling Atletico men, though, as Eric Abidal carries the trophy to the presentation plinth. They form a guard of honour as the officials walk up to receive their medals, but mainly so they can applaud the 2018 Europa League runners-up Marseille. Bittersweet scenes. Poor Dimitri Payet, tears still stinging his eyes, takes off his medal the second it’s draped around his neck. In addition to tonight’s disappointment, his World Cup chances now hang in the balance.Updated

Atletico cavort around the pitch, their fans singing their praises. Though it’s difficult to hear them, because Uefa are blasting some very intrusive music over the PA. Has somebody let Ofenbach back in? Joyous scenes nonetheless! Sad ones for Marseille, though. Atletico were deserved champions, having bossed that match since the 21st minute, when they were gifted the lead by Andre Zambo Anguissa’s terrible mistake. Antoine Griezmann scored two clinical goals, and that was pretty much that, Gabi embellishing the scoreline right at the end. But 0-3 doesn’t tell the whole story: Valere Germain missed a golden opportunity in the early exchanges, Dimitri Payet was forced off injured, and Kostas Mitroglou was so close to scoring with a towering header. It just wasn’t their night.Updated

21:36

90 min: And to huge, emotional cheers, here comes Fernando Torres! The one-time teenage captain of Atletico replaces the two-goal hero Griezmann. He’s finally going to win a major trophy with the club he’s supported since the age of five!

9.35pm BST
21:35

This puts the tin lid and pretty bow on it. Atletico stream forward, Marseille having committed too many men forward. Grizemann spreads a pass wide left for Costa, who cuts back for Koke. Koke switches play towards Gabi, coming in from the right. Gabi lashes low and hard, across Mandanda, and into the bottom right. What a goal! What a performance by this wonderfully relentless Atletico Madrid side.Updated
at 9.40pm BST


9.33pm BST
21:33

88 min: Atletico make their second change of the night. Partey comes on for Correa. Will we see Torres?

9.32pm BST
21:32

87 min: Not sure how this is still 0-2. First up, Sarr and Rami take turns to gift possession to Atletico, just outside their own box. Diego Costa’s eventual shot is no good. Then up the other end, Njie is teed up just inside the area, but shanks an awful effort out for a throw.

9.29pm BST
21:29

85 min: Marseille’s fans, to their eternal credit, are giving it plenty. It just hasn’t been their team’s night. Unless a story for the ages is about to be written.Updated
at 9.35pm BST


9.28pm BST
21:28

83 min: Space for Sarr down the right. But his cutback isn’t all that. The ball’s half cleared. Amavi decides to have a thrash from 25 yards. He sends a sweet fizzer goalwards, through a thicket of players. But Oblak is a model of concentration, and gathers a very difficult low bouncer.

9.27pm BST
21:27

81 min: And the luck’s with them, too. Because Marseille are an inch away from getting back into this final. Sanson curls a cross in from the right. Mitroglou rises highest, ten yards out, and plants a downwards header towards the bottom left. Oblak is beaten all ends up, but the ball bounces off the bottom of the left-hand post, across the face of goal, and is hacked clear. That’s so unfortunate, it was a beautiful header, a combination of power and precision, perfectly timed. It deserved a goal.Updated
at 9.32pm BST


9.25pm BST
21:25

80 min: But their heads have gone. A loose pass in the midfield allows Griezmann to scamper goalwards. Nothing comes of that move, but Lucas takes up possession and is barged to the floor by Njie. A free kick, and a chance for Atletico to allow the clock to run down some more. They’ve been ruthless and rather brilliant since being gifted the opener.

9.23pm BST
21:23

78 min: Njie is booked for rather petulantly flicking a hand towards the face of Lucas. Marseille need to calm down if they’re to have any chance of a dramatic comeback.

9.22pm BST
21:22

77 min: Griezmann sends Costa scampering with intent down the inside-left channel. For a second, it looks like he’s shaping to hit a screaming, dipping, diagonal volley towards the right-hand portion of the goal. But he decides against it, and the chance to do something, anything is gone.

9.20pm BST
21:20

76 min: Gustavo is booked after blocking Gabi as the Atletico captain hugs the right touchline. It’s a foul, nothing more, but he’s talked himself into the book for arguing the toss with the linesman. The resulting free kick is wasted.Updated
at 9.20pm BST


9.19pm BST
21:19

74 min: Germain, who passed up that early chance for Marseille, is sacrificed for Mitroglou. The last throw of the dice.

9.18pm BST
21:18

73 min: But there’s another one coming along soon enough, as Correa busies himself on the right. This one leads to an extended period of ball-hogging, the highlight of which being a glorious crossfield pass by Diego Costa. Atletico have seized back total control.

9.15pm BST
21:15

71 min: Griezmann curls the set piece into the box. Saul tries to guide a header into the top left. it comes off Gustavo for a corner, from which Koke crosses deep from the left. Mandanda is forced to tip an unpredictable dipper over. Another corner, then, this time on the right. And that one’s nothing to write home about at all.Updated
at 9.23pm BST


9.14pm BST
21:14

69 min: Gustavo has a good old hack at Griezmann’s ankles. He should go in the book, but doesn’t. A free kick to Atletico, though, just outside the Marseille box on the left.

9.13pm BST
21:13

67 min: After a very quiet period, Marseille are giving this one last shot. Sanson fights his way down the right and tries to hook into the centre from a tight spot. Not quite: the cross sails over the crossbar. But at least Atletico have been given something to think about.

9.11pm BST
21:11

66 min: From the corner, Njie has a crack, but it’s blocked by Griezmann. And then another phase of attack, as Lopez dinks into the box from deep. The ball drops to Sanson, who leans back and hoicks over.

9.10pm BST
21:10

65 min: This is better from Marseille. Lopez makes space down the right and hooks inside. Thauvin’s header isn’t all that, and Oblak should claim, but Juanfran slices out for a corner instead. A rare miscommunication in the Atletico defence.

9.08pm BST
21:08

63 min: Sanson tries to strip Saul of his trousers in a midfield tussle. He doesn’t quite succeed, though he really should be going in the book.

9.07pm BST
21:07

61 min: Ocampos has ranted himself out, and is now slumped on the bench in Quiet Fume mode. His fume serves as a decent metaphor for Marseille themselves: totally spent, they don’t look as though they have a comeback in them. Still, stranger things have happened. But they need to do something soon.

9.05pm BST
21:05

60 min: Lucas dribbles with great purpose down the left. He nearly breaks clear for a shot, but settles for a corner. His determination wins a high five from Koke, who nearly knocks him over backwards with the gesture. The corner is a complete waste of time, mind, but there’s a picture of a team who aren’t planning to take their foot off the gas just yet.

9.03pm BST
21:03

58 min: Atletico are bossing it in every department right now. They’re pinging the ball around in very pretty triangles, Griezmann, Costa and Koke at the heart of everything. Marseille by comparison are struggling to string two passes together.

9.00pm BST
21:00

56 min: Ocampos takes up his position on the Marseille bench, ranting in the expressive style. He’s really not happy.

8.59pm BST
20:59

55 min: A disgruntled Ocampos - who has been one of Marseille’s better performers - is hooked. Clinton Njie, once of Tottenham Hotspur, comes on in his stead.

8.58pm BST
20:58

53 min: And from this one, Godin flashes a header wide right from close range. He should probably have wrapped this up, right there. Marseille are clinging on for dear life.

8.57pm BST
20:57

52 min: From the set piece, the ball’s worked to Griezmann, who has the smell of a hat-trick in his nostrils. His shot, from the right-hand edge of the D, is deflected wide right for another corner.

8.56pm BST
20:56

51 min: Marseille are on the rack now. They need to clear their heads, because when Costa tries to break into the box from the left, Rami comes across and nearly slices a clearance backwards and over his own keeper, into the top right. Corner.

8.55pm BST
20:55

This was so simple. A huge hole in the Marseille midfield. Koke romps into it, and slips a ball down the inside-right for Griezmann. The striker buzzes into the box, draws Mandanda, and half-dinks, half-strokes the ball past the keeper and into the bottom left. What a gorgeous finish!Updated
at 9.07pm BST


8.53pm BST
20:53

48 min: Correa cuts in from the right, having exchanged passes with Costa. Sarr does very well to stop him when, for a second, another goal looked on the cards. But it’s a futile gesture, because ...

8.53pm BST
20:53

47 min: A slow start to the second half. On the touchline, Atletico assistant coach German Burgos pulls on an extra gilet as the rain comes down in stair rods. Right now, Diego Simeone will be pleased he’s banned from the touchline and banished to the dry stand.

8.50pm BST
20:50

So here we go again! Atletico get the party restarted, having swapped off the already-booked Vrsaljko for Juanfran. Taking no chances. It’s tipping down in Lyon.

8.42pm BST
20:42

Half-time eulogy. One of England’s heroes of 1966 passed away today. Here’s Richard Williams on the unassuming but brilliant Ramon Wilson.

8.36pm BST
20:36

And that’s that for the first half. It couldn’t have gone much worse for Marseille, who spurned an early gilt-edged chance, gave up the cheapest of goals, and lost their influential captain Dimitri Payet to injury. Atletico are 45 minutes away from their third Europa League trophy.

8.35pm BST
20:35

45 min: Thauvin is down now. He’s taken a deflected clearance flush in his trouser arrangement. Ooyah, oof.

8.32pm BST
20:32

44 min: Griezmann drops deep, and very nearly threads a pass down the left to release Costa into the Marseille box. Sarr does extremely well to spot what’s going on and intercept. For a second, there was very real danger on the cards.

8.31pm BST
20:31

42 min: Marseille have totally lost their rhythm since the loss of Payet. Atletico look in control of this game now. Ocampos tries to Garrincha his way into the Atletico box from the left; it’s a nice run, but there’s simply too many red-and-white shirts to diddle his way past. No way through.

There are 15 consortium bidding to join the A-League but National Soccer League winners Brisbane Strikers won’t be one of them after pulling out of the expansion process.The Strikers have withdrawn from the race which will see two teams join the competition next year, citing issues with FFA’s process.The club’s chief executive Bruce Dinsdale said their bid had well-capitalised and passionate backers but decided against buying in at the eleventh hour.“Many important financial aspects of the expansion process, and the expectations around ongoing criteria, are neither clear nor specific and do not allow for appropriate financial and strategic planning,” he said in a statement.“The confidence of our investment group in the financial sustainability has therefore been significantly eroded. As such, this group will not commit to funding such a process.”FFA repudiated the idea that their expansion process promoted financial uncertainty, pointing to the volume of bids.“FFA has received 15 EOI registrations representing groups across Australia, many that have been actively working with the FFA and Deloitte and are well advanced in their pursuit of an A-League licence,” a statement said.“All parties have been aware that the initial EOI stage is followed by a much more rigorous request for proposal stage at which far more detailed information, including financial information, is provided.”While the Strikers are the first expansion bidders to withdraw from the formal process, other bid groups have privately expressed similar concerns. The two successful clubs may not receive annual dividends from FFA until the next broadcast deal, still another five years away, because the existing 10 clubs are unwilling to split their share any further.FFA is also expected to seek an expansion fee that could be upwards of $10 million for each new entrant to help underwrite the costs associated with growing the competition.The Strikers won the NSL in 1997 but missed out on joining the A-League in 2005 when FFA bosses selected a new entity, the Queensland Roar, to take the sole licence from the sunshine state. They now play in the Queensland state league out of Perry Park, which they promised to transform to a 15,000-seat stadium with a successful A-League bid.Their withdrawal leaves FFA with two options to expand the league in Queensland; Brisbane City and Gold Coast United."

The Fulham juggernaut hit a pothole last weekend. A team unbeaten in 23 Championship matches got turned over by 20th‑placed Birmingham. Had they won, the Cottagers would have been promoted to the Premier League ahead of Cardiff. Instead they lost 3-1, conceding two first-half goals. So, how to avoid it happening again in the play-offs?Fulham must now go again and face two encounters with Derby in 72 hours, starting with the first leg at Pride Park on Friday night. “It’s a second chance – something like this,” is how Slavisa Jokanovic describes it and the Fulham manager has previously described the play-offs as a positive for his team, a fallback should things go wrong. Now that they have, these two games offer a chance for immediate redemption.“OK, at the last moment we could not make it. I accept that. I am head coach of this club,” Jokanovic said. “We must be realistic and admit that we didn’t bring our best performance against Birmingham and we made many mistakes. But that’s it. What we did do was cut an 18-point gap between us and Cardiff in the regular season and overtook 15 teams. We don’t lose our confidence after 90 bad minutes, because we have 2,000 very good minutes behind us.”The play-offs are notorious for contradicting league form. While the team that finish third in the table, as Fulham did, are statistically the most likely to go up, only one club in the last five years has done so. Perhaps more worrying for them is the fact Fulham are yet to win a single game in the Football League play-offs.In 1989 they lost both legs of the semi-final against Bristol Rovers in Division Three, in 1998 to Grimsby in Division Two. Then, last year, Jokanovic’s Fulham lost 2-1 on aggregate against Reading. The match was decided with a single incident, a penalty scored by Yann Kermogant after a Tomas Kalas handball.“We didn’t make so many mistakes last year,” Jokanovic said this week . “We lost one 50-50 decision when we touched the ball with a hand after a complicated situation. From my point of view, it was not the way to decide who plays in a final, but it’s football. I don’t look back at this game.”All the same, Jokanovic hopes the experience of last year’s semi-final will stand his team in good stead. With away goals not a consideration, it is also a unique type of encounter, a “180-minute match”, as he puts it. He remains bullish, too.“The play-off a year ago showed us what kind of matches these games are. Now we are one year older, one year more experienced,” the Serb added. “We have ahead of us one play-off game of 180 minutes. We are a team who take a huge level of the risk and we have to manage this aspect of the situation. We have to be quiet, we have to concentrate and take the right decisions during the game. Definitely I expect we are going to be more successful this time.”The risk Jokanovic speaks of reflects the way he sees the game panning out. Derby’s manager, Gary Rowett, has also described his team as having been given “a second chance” after they slipped out of the top six in April only to bounce back and hold on to sixth place on the final day. Jokanovic believes Rowett’s team will let Fulham dictate the play, in both legs, and look to catch them out on the break.“We know how they will play,” Jokanovic said. “They are a good team – expensive, experienced. They will try what they always try, to be aggressive and try and catch us in transition. They will not try to dominate us with the ball. They won’t take the ball.“It is our responsibility to try and move the ball. To take enough acceptable risks during the game. And that’s it. In the 180 minutes different things will happen and we will have to manage them.”Bluff fighting talk from the Serb then, before a crucial game in his career. There is no doubt he has greatly improved Fulham in his two-and-a-half years but now he needs to prove it in a one-off situation (or two, depending on your perspective).“I want to be successful‚“ Jokanovic added of his own ambitions. “I want to win all the games. At the end, I care about my team, my club supporters, staff and myself too. What I really want in the future is to be successful. The easiest way is to do that with my team.”"

Michel Platini, the former Uefa president, has claimed “a little trickery” was used in the 1998 World Cup draw to increase the chances of France and Brazil meeting in the final.Platini is serving a four-year ban from involvement in football – reduced twice from an original eight-year sanction – after he was found guilty of receiving an “underhand payment” from the then-Fifa president Sepp Blatter.The former France and Juventus playmaker was co-president of the World Cup organising committee in 1998, and admitted the group allocations for seeded teams were made with an eye on a “dream” final.Brazil were placed in Group A, as was the standard practice at the time for the defending champions. France, the hosts, were then allocated to Group C – meaning if both seeded teams won their groups they could not meet before the final.That was how it turned out, with France beating Paraguay, Italy and Croatia before overcoming Brazil 3-0 at the Stade de France with two goals from Zinedine Zidane.“France-Brazil in the final, it was the dream of everyone,” Platini told the radio station France Bleu Sport, in an interview to be broadcast in full on Sunday.The 62-year-old was laughing as he said: “There was a little trickery. We did not spend six years organising the World Cup to not do some little shenanigans. Do you think other World Cup hosts did not?”While teams had been allocated to specific groups at previous tournaments, it had typically been to keep countries from the same confederation separate.At Italia 90, the six top seeds were assigned to groups A to F in order, while England were placed in the “London group” at both the 1966 World Cup and Euro 96. In both tournaments, this resulted in the hosts playing all their games at Wembley. • This article was amended on 24 May 2018 to provide a better translation of the charge against Platini."

José Mourinho is targeting Toby Alderweireld as part of the Manchester United manager’s intended revamp of his defence this summer, with the Tottenham Hotspur centre-back open to a move to Old Trafford.Alderweireld is out of contract in 2020 and discussions over fresh terms have reached a virtual impasse. The Belgian is conscious he can leave Tottenham next summer for €25m (£22m) due to a clause in his deal, though only if an option to extend until 2020 is activated.United are aware any move to sign Alderweireld will be made difficult by the tough negotiating skills of Daniel Levy, especially as the Tottenham chairman will not wish to sell a prime asset to a direct rival. Should Levy be prepared to sell he would no doubt demand a sizeable fee from United, perhaps even more than the world-record £75m that Liverpool paid Southampton for Virgil van Dijk in January.Whether Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman, would countenance such a fee for a player edging towards his 30th birthday remains to be seen, with Alderweireld’s wage demands also to be considered. The player currently earns a basic £50,000 a-week at Spurs and would seek closer to treble that for what would be his last major contract.Alderweireld would fit into the profile of the experienced player Mourinho wishes to add as he seeks to challenge Manchester City next season, a requirement echoed by Nemanja Matic after Saturday’s FA Cup final defeat to Chelsea.While the interest in Alderweireld may put Chris Smalling’s future in the balance, the manager also wishes to add a fresh right-back, left-back, wide forward and at least one midfielder, Shakhtar Donetsk’s Fred is thought to be of interest to Mourinho in the latter position."

After months of speculation and anxious waiting it is finally known which teams will be competing in the top two revamped tiers of women’s football in England next season. It was always going to be controversial with up to nine places available in the second round of applications across the two leagues and 15 clubs competing for spots. The lack of seemingly viable applications for the new fully professional top tier, the Women’s Super League, has meant that only six sides have been successful.There was confirmation in March that Arsenal, Birmingham, Brighton, Bristol, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City, Reading and Yeovil had been successfully admitted to the WSL in the first round (open to clubs already in the top two tiers) with Brighton the only club to move up. Aston Villa, Doncaster Belles, Durham, London Bees, Millwall, Sheffield City and Tottenham all secured their existing status in the second tier (Women’s Championship). But who joins them, who has missed out and how worthy are they?West Ham United West Ham were one of the first teams to announce a bid for the top flight and are delighted to have been successful. Having taken the women’s team in-house towards the end of 2016, Jack Sullivan, son of the joint-owner David Sullivan, was named managing director of the women’s side and they began to recruit with intent. Moving up will not be easy, West Ham finished seventh in the Women’s Premier League Southern Division (third tier) in the 2017-18 season but rumours of the former Chelsea and Liverpool manager Matt Beard (out of a job after Boston Breakers folded) being readied to manage West Ham in the WSL will certainly help their transition.ArsenalBirmingham CityBrighton & Hove AlbionBristol CityChelsea (pictured)EvertonLiverpoolManchester CityReadingWest Ham UnitedYeovil TownAston VillaCharlton AthleticDoncaster Rovers BellesDurhamLewesLeicester CityLondon BeesManchester UnitedMillwallSheffield FCSheffield UnitedTottenham HotspurManchester United When Manchester United announced they would finally be launching a women’s team the reaction was mixed. There are obviously huge benefits to one of the most powerful clubs in the world changing tack and deciding to take women’s football seriously. It is 13 years since United shut down their women’s side but the growth of the game and the success of Manchester City have no doubt prompted them to join the party. However, their joining comes at a cost. With places so tight the possibility of the Red Devils leapfrogging longer standing sides into the Women’s Championship has provoked anger and frustration. United are reportedly spending £5m on building their squad, as a professional team, and that has also raised eyebrows. They are clearly financially suitable for the top flight but have insisted on a chance to build up from tier two. It makes sense from their point of view; they have three months to build a new club. But with places at the top less valuable in this round of the process, and their professional side being allowed to play in a semi-professional league, there has been irritation to say the least.Charlton Athletic, Sheffield United & Leicester City Charlton and Leicester are natural choices to join the Women’s Championship and alongside Sheffield United worked hard on their bids. The London side won the WPL South Division title and secured their admission to the new second tier (while having also to meet the criteria) with a 2-1 play-off win against the Northern Division champions, Blackburn Rovers, on Sunday. They won the FA Cup in 2005, are two-time League Cup winners.Meanwhile Leicester City finished second in the third tier WPL Northern Division behind Blackburn. Sheffield United are a team on the rise. They won promotion to the fourth tier Midlands Division 1 and finished third in their first season. They are coming from lower down but their promotion is welcome reward for the work they are doing.Lewes FC A surprise addition to the league but a welcome one. Perhaps less deserving than some, having finished fifth in the WPL Southern Division. However, the club’s approach to their women’s team and their ambition has been impressive. The first club to pay their women’s and men’s teams the same, the side’s also get equal use of the unique Dripping Pan stadium.Sunderland, Watford and Oxford Sunderland’s demotion from the top flight, probably into the third tier, is devastating. The north-east has lost its sole representative at the top. A side in turmoil as its parent men’s club attempts to distance itself, they have performed well beyond their means to finish seventh this season. They held off from bidding for entry in the first round and, with the FA desperate to avoid an uneven 11 teams in the Women’s Super League, their application must have been questionable. The future now hangs in the balance after a year of wrecking tactics from a club not wanting the burden of a women’s team.Like Sunderland Watford did not bid in the first round. They in fact announced they would choose to drop down to the amateur third tier, causing the respected manager Keith Boanas to resign, before a change of heart saw them submit an application late on. The turmoil has affected things on the pitch with the side picking up only four points from 18 games in 2017-18. Oxford have suffered a similar fate but without the off-field controversy. They finished eighth in WSL2 and their manager, Andy Cook, has resigned following the news they will drop down.Southampton A surprise omission from the Women’s Championship. Southampton, like Manchester United, announced they would launch a team and bid for entry for the new season. As a Premier League club they aren’t exactly strapped for cash, and they have a youth set-up. The disappointment could lead them to scrap the plans altogether. They will likely have to enter at the seventh tier and work their way up. Another tactic could be to adopt an existing local team.Blackburn Rovers Having won the WPL Northern Division title, Blackburn missed out on an automatic spot in the second tier thanks to their play-off against Charlton. However, they were confident they would prevail regardless. Missing out is very, very harsh. They went undefeated last season on the way to a double and this year scooped a treble.Crystal Palace and Derby County Palace are bitterly disappointed not to have made the cut. They finished above Lewes and West Ham, finishing third in the WPL Southern Division. Derby finished seventh in the Northern Division and linked up with Derby University to build their bid.C&K Basildon Ladies The only club unaffiliated to a men’s side in the process but C&K Basildon Ladies are no second-class team. They finished behind Charlton in the WPL Southern Division and it is disappointing not to see a side still going it alone in the top two tiers."

Keylor Navas A film of Navas’s life came out recently. Man of faith, it’s called. He has needed it too – always seems to be on the verge of replacement, but still there. Was to be the makeweight in deal to sign David De Gea from Manchester United in August 2015 but the deal collapsed because the documents were not submitted to Fifa before the Spanish transfer deadline.Dani Carvajal Born in Leganés, a Madrid suburb, and was the small, floppy-haired blond kid who laid the first stone at Real Madrid’s training ground with Alfredo Di Stefano. He returned much later a bearded and ultra-competitive right-back.Sergio Ramos “More tattoos per square centimetre than anywhere else,” he said when he posed with David Beckham last week. Each tells a story and he’s accumulated loads of them: the devoted Catholic has a tattoo of Mary covering the top half of his left arm. Also likes bullfighting and horses. Owns a stud farm in Andalusia.Raphaël Varane Zinedine Zidane saw him at 18 and brought him to Spain when no one else had even heard of him. Asked Zidane to call him back in June 2011 when the Madrid manager expressed an interest, because he was in the middle of revising for his exams. Scored a header on his debut – against Barcelona.Marcelo Lived with Roberto Carlos when he first arrived in Madrid with the impossible task of replacing the man with the thunderous thighs – and, in the end, did so. The best left-back in the world, Roberto Carlos says. Diego Maradona says he’s the third best player in La Liga, after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.Luka Modric Modric is the name Granada midfielder Javi Márquez gave his son. Not Luka, Modric. “My wife liked the name; it’s just a coincidence,” he protested, before adding: “Although Modric is a good person and a good player.” Brings what José Mourinho considers “that artistic sense” to the game.Casemiro Don’t let that cherubic, slightly chubby, gentle smile fool you. And he might be a defensive midfielder but don’t let him shoot either. “Has changed the face of Madrid,” according to Atéltico’s coach, Diego Simeone. Marcelo is even more effusive: “He saved my life. I might play until I’m 45 with this guy by my side.”Toni Kroos Says he only ever got nervous on his wedding day, and a big fan of Robbie Williams; really, really big. His father, Roland, works as youth coach for Hansa Rostock. Scored twice for Germany in that 7-1 humbling of Brazil at the last World Cup.Isco Francisco Román Alarcón Suárez or Isco has a dog called Messi “because Messi’s the best and so is my dog”. He said that before he was at Madrid, of course. Team-mates call him “Magic” – and let’s face it, you have to pretty good for them to call you that. Scored a hat-trick for Spain in the 6-1 drubbing of Argentina in March.Cristiano Ronaldo Once said that he was going to carry on playing until he was 40. It seemed silly then; it doesn’t now. Has the world’s biggest Facebook fanbase with 103 million followers and an airport named after him and his own football museum.Gareth Bale Admits he isn’t that good at watching football – he’d rather put on the golf – but is a bit good at playing it. Better than some in Spain seem prepared to admit. Attended the same Cardiff high school as future Wales rugby union captain Sam Warburton.Karim Benzema Appears in a video for Walabok by the French rap artist Booba. The video clip features images of drugs, bags full of cash and men in hoodies pointing guns towards the camera. Says he doesn’t like the Marseillaise because it’s a “call to war”.Marco Asensio Asensio’s mother was Dutch and he was named after Marco van Basten. As a kid could barely walk for a year with growth problems in his knees. In February scored Real Madrid’s 6,000th goal in the Spanish top division.Lucas Vázquez Walked up to the penalty spot at the end of the 2016 final spinning the ball on his finger, which he admits made him look cooler than he really was.Kiko Casilla Brother Pepe is a Spanish international volleyball player. Played only 15 minutes for Spain, letting in one – scored by Kroos. Last played for Real in the 3-1 home defeat by Juventus in April.Nacho Nacho used to be told by Álvaro Arbeloa he would have been in the Spain squad if he played for anyone else but in the end he got there playing for Madrid. Able to play anywhere at the back, very fast (although he doesn’t look it), and made it despite having diabetes. His son José Ignacio was born on the morning of Madrid’s 2016 Champions League win.Theo Hernández Brother of Lucas, son of Jean Francois, footballers both, and brought up at Atlético Madrid before moving across the city this summer. Like Zidane, a native of Marseille. Yet to make his senior debut for France.Mateo Kovacic The first time Rafa Benítez suggested that Madrid could sign Kovacic, whom he said would one day be a €90m player, the club’s president said why not sign him when he is a €90m player. He’s not yet, but he is good. Nicknamed Il Professore (the Professor).Loris Karius Bayern Munich fan from Biberach an der Riss grew up idolising Oliver Kahn and was inspired by his three-save shootout performance against Valencia in 2001 but has never been involved in a penalty showdown at senior level. “When you are standing on the line, there is a voice inside you that will tell you which corner he might put it,” Karius says.Trent Alexander-Arnold Grew up within walking distance of Melwood and lives at home with his mum. Ambassador for An Hour For Others, a community organisation that helps vulnerable people. Will be the first teenager to play in a European Cup final for Liverpool if selected.Dejan Lovren Has a bromance going with Mo Salah and says that Virgil van Dijk – with whom he has helped Liverpool to 17 clean sheets – has improved his game. His family are Bosnian Croats who escaped to Germany during the Bosnian war and he is heavily involved with the Help Refugees charity. Vocal in dressing room but introspective. Excellent at basketball.Virgil van Dijk World’s most expensive defender was born in Breda to a Dutch father and Surinamese mother. Worked as a kitchen hand at the Oncle Jean restaurant in Breda when he was 16 – and still sends them his signed football jerseys. Wants to be Liverpool’s regular free-kick taker.Andy Robertson Released at 15 by Celtic – the team he supported as a boy – for being too small and worked in the ticket office at Hampden Park before turning professional with Dundee United. Relegated with Hull last season, now a firm favourite with Jürgen Klopp and the Kop. Donated a signed shirt of Roberto Firmino to a young Liverpool fan who had given his pocket money to a local food bank.Georginio Wijnaldum Wanted to be a gymnast and was not much interested in football before signing for Sparta Rotterdam and then Feyenoord. A popular figure in the dressing room, he is the half brother of Huddersfield’s Rajiv van La Parra and brother of Giliano Wijnaldum, who plays for Willem II.Jordan Henderson The main, if unheralded, influence on a united dressing room made his professional debut with Sunderland in 2008 and spent time on loan at Coventry. Turned down a move to Fulham at the start of Brendan Rodgers’ reign as Liverpool manager. Rodgers wanted to use him as part-exchange in a deal for Clint Dempsey.James Milner Relishes his Boring James Milner tag and known as Milly the Machine by Jürgen Klopp for the ground he covers. Enjoys his status as a social media sensation, and his reaction to the ball going in off his face against Roma – “Anyone got any tips for getting a Champions League logo off a face?” – caused a Twitter frenzy.Mohamed Salah So popular in Egypt that he was spared compulsory national service in 2014 – following an intervention by the prime minister and the national team head coach - and received 1m votes in a presidential election in which he played no part. Lives in Cheshire with wife Magi and daughter Makka. Chose to wear the No 74 shirt at Fiorentina in tribute to the 74 fans killed in Port Said disaster.Roberto Firmino Was discovered by a dentist, Marcellus Portella, who saw him playing for local side Clube de Regatas Brasil and promptly became his agent. Was deported back to Brazil as a 17-year-old from Madrid airport in a row with Spanish immigration when booked to take a connecting flight to Marseille. Loves to score a “no look” goal.Sadio Mané Travelled 500 miles from his home village in Senegal to Dakar for a successful trial at the Génération Foot academy. A devout Muslim, whose father forbade him from playing football. Nicknamed Ronaldinho as a boy and now a “Lion of Teranga”, as Senegal internationals are know. First thing he did after signing for Liverpool was telephone his mother.Simon Mignolet Speaks four languages and has a degree in political science. Told Klopp after the New Year’s Day win at Burnley that his rotation of Liverpool’s goalkeepers “wasn’t healthy”. Klopp agreed and has played Karius ever since. Popular with fans for his jokey tweets, particularly the post that showed his oversized head superimposed on a hipshaking body while cheering on Salah at the PFA awards.Adam Lallana Jürgen Klopp’s next door neighbour has a Spanish grandfather and grew up supporting Everton. His father ran a carehome in Bournemouth and his looks earned him a deal as the face a high-street fashion retailer’s men’s collection before the 2014 World Cup promoting “ a collection of heritage pieces recontextualised for the modern world”.Alberto Moreno Credited Mona Nemmer, Liverpool’s nutritionist, with his improved form at the start of the season after she made allowances in his diet for jamón ibérico and sea food. Likes tattoos: one of his legs is decorated with an image of a gun-toting chimpanzee dressed in a suit and wearing headphones.Nathaniel Clyne Played four seasons in the Championship with Crystal Place where he was their young player of the year in 2009 and 2010 before switching to Southampton in 2012.

While at Chelsea, the Reading-born player spent a year at Vitesse Arnhem where he is remembered for essaying a Cruyff turn with added nutmeg every bit as spectacular as Firmino’s humbling of Roberto Soldado in the Europa League.Danny Ings Created and funded the Danny Ings Disability Sports Project to help children in the Burnley area. Once spent a nine-game loan spell with Dorset non-leaguers Dorchester while on Bournemouth’s books, scoring four goals.Ragnar Klavan His boyhood hero is former Derby County and Sunderland goalkeeper Mart Poom.

The final bow was a grand sweeping gesture, with the kind of flourish that would not look out of place on a Broadway stage. Arsène Wenger emerged for his last Premier League act, strode through a guard of honour, made a right turn towards the corner of Arsenal fans and when he arrived in front of them he bent that lean frame in acknowledgement of one hell of a story.Then he turned and skipped merrily back towards the dugout. Wenger is not renowned for his skipping. But everything feels different now. Fans who had not so long ago vocalised their discontent were eager to shower acclaim and gratitude. Wenger, who had been a picture of strain and stress until his leaving date was announced, looks as if the years have fallen from his face, the spring rejuvenating his step.The warmth of these past few weeks, as Wenger has gone on his farewell Premier League tour, has been so generous he joked that he should leave Arsenal more often. “I should have announced every week I retire,” he said. “People are so nice since I said that.”In time he will look back on the present from Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford, the golden Invincibles trophy to take home from his last home game, a rendition of “one Arsène Wenger” from both Burnley and Leicester supporters, and here the Huddersfield faithful offered their own memento: in the 22nd minute of the match the entire crowd rose to give Wenger an uplifting standing ovation. The man who tends to watch his games sitting felt moved to stand up and wave his appreciation. The way various corners of the English game have volunteered to add their applause is recognition of a football man but also reflects the way Wenger influenced the game in this country.A few yards down the sideline in the home dugout, David Wagner is adored in these parts for the renaissance he has inspired at Huddersfield Town. A foreign manager with big ideas, strong principles, and a willingess to throw himself into a new place and absorb its heart and soul – that idea is now strongly woven into the fabric of Premier League life.Wenger opened that door in 1996 for all others from around the globe to follow. By winning the Premier League in his first full season he gave credibility to the notion that an overseas manager can flourish in what had been an insular football environment, just beginning to broaden horizons. It felt fitting, somehow, that Wenger would bid his final farewell at the place where Herbert Chapman’s managerial status was born. Wenger noticed a big photograph of English football’s first great moderniser outside the dressing room. “He smiled at me,” the Frenchman said. “Herbert Chapman, maybe our greatest manager, came from here. So for me to come here had a special meaning.”Chapman, Arsenal’s original great innovator, built a team at Huddersfield which won the league three times in succession between 1924 and 1926 before moving to Highbury to repeat the feat in the early 1930s. He was a visionary of his time. A banner in the away end bore the message: “Thank you Herbert. Merci Arsène.”Football’s relentless schedule means Wenger does not like to dwell on history while he is conditioned into thinking about the next game, but for once he could. “I am very proud having contributed a little bit,” he said. “I don’t know what will stay or remain through the victories or defeats. I think what will remain is the formidable human aspect of the last 22 years – that is special and I will cherish that. I had fantastic human experiences at the club, above the results, it was a human adventure.”Exactly 1,235 matches ago Wenger picked an Arsenal team for the very first time. A side of nine Englishmen, one Welshman and a young Frenchman starting his third Premier League game by the name of Patrick Vieira, defeated Blackburn 2-0. Here at Huddersfield, Wenger’s final selection contained 11 different nationalities but signed off with an old-fashioned scoreline, the old George Graham favourite, one-nil to the Arsenal. Now, where did those 22 years go?Wenger’s long goodbye has been cathartic, with all the bad vibes evaporating in the late-season sunshine. It has ensured the love affair, as he describes it, did not peter out, or end with any recrimination. It has allowed him, and the Arsenal fans, to remember why they fell for each other in the first place.The bow was a impromptu show of emotion. “It was spontaneous,” Wenger said, “because I know that we’ve disappointed the away fans this season, that many of them they live the whole week and use their spare money to travel up to games. It’s part of the respect. We had disagreements which I accept but we had one thing in common: we loved Arsenal football club and I wanted to share that with them today.”The final whistle blew and it was over. All it needed was a soundtrack by Edith Piaf. He returned down the tunnel, pausing to give a thumbs up as he went. Over, and finally, respectfully and beautifully, Wenger out."
football,"The dream of USA dominating world football has been a dream for years. But structural and cultural issues ensure it won’t happen anytime soon

It’s only a matter of time, they tell us. The powerful economy. The changing demographics. All the kids who can’t remember when the USA didn’t have a pro league and Americans couldn’t watch the Premier League every weekend on TV. All of those things, they say, will propel the US men to global dominance one day, if we can only fix one or two things.There’s only one problem. It’s not going to happen in a long, long time. Not by 2022. Not by 2026, when the USA may be a World Cup co-host, depending on the level of anger over US policies when the vote is taken in June. Not in the next century at the very least. And the women may not win much in the near future, either.Here’s why We the People of the United States cannot form the perfect soccer union. We’re too far behind. In Europe, soccer has been entrenched since the 19th century. English and German soldiers stepped out of the trenches in world war one to play games during an unofficial Christmas ceasefire. Most of the final 16 clubs in this year’s Champions League boast at least 100 years of history. The sport also has long dominated in South America and large parts of Africa and Asia.The USA had a good foothold 90 years ago, with a promising young American Soccer League providing the backbone of the players who reached the 1930 World Cup semi-finals (although only 13 teams entered.) But the ASL disappeared a few years later, starting a cycle that would become too familiar through the generations. Without the beacon of a pro league, soccer was relegated to leagues of dedicated immigrants who shrugged off the scorn of the neighbors who eagerly assimilated into “American” sports like gridiron football, baseball and basketball.In the 1960s, a few different leagues vied for supremacy before the remnants were forced to join up to form the NASL, which had a few good years in the late 70s and early 80s before collapsing under the weight of overexpansion and inequity. In the 1980s, the future of US soccer seemed to be indoors, with several teams averaging more than 10,000 fans per game to see a soccer/hockey hybrid. At the same time, youth soccer started to boom. But with the federation taking a laissez-faire attitude, youth clubs went in all sorts of different directions. Today, we have two national umbrella organizations – US Youth Soccer and US Club Soccer – racing to form regional elite leagues. Confused parents sign up kids for tryouts and hope for the best outcomes while praying they don’t end up spending thousands of dollars on airfares and hotel rooms. A team may travel 700 miles for a blowout instead of traveling seven miles for a competitive game.Even those who agree US Soccer needs to change can’t get on the same page. In the 2018 federation presidential election, we needed two hands to count all the “reform” candidates in the field. Meanwhile, efforts to unify lower-division soccer and push the USA toward a promotion/relegation system are bogged down in an alphabet soup of brand names – NPSL, UPSL, PDL, ASL and more – most of which insist on being a national framework rather than a regional component of a larger pyramid.And we’re too litigious. The US soccer community is very good at establishing legal precedent. The old NASL’s legal skirmishes with the NFL were landmarks of sports business law, as was the MLS players’ lawsuit against the league in the late 90s.What those lawsuits did not do was establish a firm ground for soccer in the USA. Far from it. The MLS players’ suit hindered the league’s early growth. Today, you need a scorecard to keep track of all the legal actions. A possible move of the Columbus Crew to Austin is held up in court. Other actions challenge the lack of promotion/relegation or the disparate pay structures between the men’s and women’s national teams. The new NASL is even suing individual members of US Soccer’s board over a vote that didn’t go their way. Some of these problems could be solved if the interested parties were forced to sit down and negotiate. The lawsuits, though, have simply calcified everyone’s positions and limited the capacity to talk about new approaches to build up pro soccer.There’s the competition too. Soccer is the most popular sport in the world. Not here. Even in Washington DC, where thriving immigrant communities love the global game, the local media hailed the NHL’s Washington Capitals as the first major pro team to make a conference final for many years, ignoring the feats of the Washington Spirit (NWSL) and DC United (MLS). If you want success it’s best to be patient. But we’re too obsessed with the quick fix. Futsal! Focusing on dribbling – no, wait, passing – at an early age! Ending “pay to play” (they don’t say how)! The hotly contested US Soccer presidential election showed we have no shortage of ideas. And a vast contingent of supporters, many of them new to the sport, remain convinced that all evils will disappear if the USA merely institutes promotion/relegation, which will magically yield an exponential rise in investment and make every US child hungry to represent his or her hometown club in its fight to climb the ladder.Fixing things is indeed easy. All we have to do is make up for generations of cultural antipathy, incentivize people who are currently staying out of soccer to put their money and children into it, ensure the vast expenditures of those who’ve paid to be part of MLS’ effort to accelerate the USA’s pro and youth growth, get kids to put down their video games and get out on a neighborhood futsal court, get the powers that be to check their egos and lawyers at the door, and perhaps build a time machine. Maybe that could happen. Or maybe the Yellowstone supervolcano could render much of the United States uninhabitable.The good news? There’s little harm in trying, and we’re in good company. Only eight countries have ever won the men’s World Cup. England only won it on home soil – and that was more than 50 years ago. Holland haven’t won it. Mexico haven’t come close. And yet, the sport thrives in all of those countries (and dozens more where a World Cup victory is the most distant of dreams).It’s certainly close to thriving here in the States. Sports bars catering to Premier League fans are now the rule rather than the exception. Plenty of cities, not just at MLS level, have rollicking live soccer atmospheres. The National Women’s Soccer League has lost a couple of teams but gained more, already outlasting previous attempts at a women’s league. All without a winning a World Cup.And maybe a wave of talent can coincide with a run of good luck as it did in 2002, when the US men made it to the quarter-finals. Perhaps the US women will win again, though they now face many of the same issues (fractious and litigious stakeholders especially) as the men. We can always dream. "

Clarke Carlisle, the former chairman of the Professional Footballers’ Association, believes the criticism of Raheem Sterling’s tattoo of an M16 assault rifle is “unfair” and has called for the England forward to be left in peace as he prepares for the World Cup finals next month.Sterling, who is training with Gareth Southgate’s squad before England’s first warm-up match against Nigeria at Wembley on Saturday, featured on the Sun’s front page for a second day in a row on Wednesday despite his explanation that the symbol had been chosen as a tribute to his father, who was murdered in Jamaica when the Manchester City player was two years old.Richard Taylor, whose son Damilola was killed after a street attack in Peckham in 2000, has accused Sterling of “glamorising” gun violence and urged him to apologise to “the families of gun victims”. But Carlisle was adamant that Sterling has been singled out for attempting to use a tragic event in his life as a catalyst for his career.“People seem to be looking for any reason to be outraged these days but who are we to dictate what grief should look like?” Carlisle told the Guardian. “This is a young man who lost his father at a very young age and that symbol is a sign of something that is very important.“He’s reappropriated it and given it a dual meaning to give him a catalyst to further himself and his professional career. How can anyone say that’s outrageous? I think he’s done a magnificent thing in very tough times. Let the man grieve in his way. Every credit to him – people need to keep their noses out of his private business.”Piers Morgan has been among the most vocal of critics, describing the tattoo as “offensive and misguided”. Carlisle, who was part of a PFA delegation that met the former prime minister David Cameron in 2012 to discuss racism and homophobia in football, insisted Sterling’s decision could provide a positive message to children.“A young kid will look at it and they will ask – if they ask they will hear the positive message behind it,” he said. “I don’t think it’s any coincidence it’s just before the World Cup – our media seem to want to totally derail any possibility of going into the tournament with any positive focus. I don’t know why that is. Why not let the guy go about his work in peace?“The way they have gone about this is totally unfair – they’ve taken something that is personal to him and compared it to another situation that is tragic to someone else. The media has chosen to connect those two things together and that’s not fair.“The sad thing is that even if people choose to ignore it, the seed has been planted. This kind of thing happens all the time – it plants a seed for people to water and grasp at should anything go wrong on a professional basis. It’s ridiculous because as soon as he does anything wrong in Russia he will be lambasted.”The Football Association has defended Sterling’s tattoo, praising his “honest and heartfelt” explanation for the choice in a statement this week. However, the former Nigeria striker Efan Ekoku admitted that the controversy could easily have been avoided.“A gun is a symbol of oppression, destroyer of families and a weapon of war however you try to dress it up,” he said. “I’m sure he doesn’t want to glamorise guns but other people clearly see it differently.“You have to be careful how you use symbols, especially if you are in the public eye. All famous people have a responsibility to themselves first and foremost to set an example but often you do things for selfish reasons. I’m sure Raheem has done it without thinking of the full consequences. It’s a shame because it’s a distraction for him and the England team.”"

Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale cast significant doubt in their futures at Real Madrid in the midst of celebrations at the end of the Champions League final. Bale said he needed to be a regular starter and would talk to his agent about his options and Ronaldo referred to his time at the club in the past tense and said that he would make a statement in the coming days. The future of each may depend in part upon the other.Bale, who came on and scored twice to win the European Cup, said: “I need to be playing week in week out, and that’s not happened this season for one reason or another. I had a five- or six-week injury at the start of the season and I’ve been fit ever since so now I have to sit down in the summer and discuss it with my agent and take it from there.”Ronaldo too appeared to say that his future lies elsewhere. “It’s been very nice to be at Madrid,” he said. “In the coming days I will give a response to the fans because they actually have always been at my side.”Ronaldo’s mention of the fans was probably designed to highlight the difference between their support and what he perceives as a lack of support from the president, Florentino Pérez. This is not the first time he has expressed unhappiness and suggested that he wants to leave, only to stay rather than following through on his threats. Rarely though has he spoken as openly.Pérez responded by saying: “Now is not the time for individual issues. There’s always lots of noise and then nothing happens.”Ronaldo was outspoken too on the future of the European Cup: “The Champions League should change and be called the CR7 Champions League. I have won five and I am the [top] goalscorer again.”He later expressed regret at the timing of his comments regarding his future but said he had talked from the heart and that he would make the statement he promised. “I’ll speak,” he added. “I can’t hide that [I have something to say]. It wasn’t the right moment because of the history of the club.”"

Here’s the match report from Nick Miller. 

5.57pm BST
17:57

Congratulations, Rotherham, who can look forward to Villa Park, Stoke, The Hawthorns and the Liberty. Commiserations to Shrewsbury, who get to go to Sunderland. The best team won, it has to be said. Now, one play-off to go. Coventry v Exeter on Monday. Who will be travelling to the New Meadow?

5.53pm BST
17:53

Rotherham manager Paul Warne speaksThey went toe to toe with us, I am really proud of my group of lads. It was a horrendous 12 months last year. [On Wood] I call him my wrecking ball. He is prepared to break his nose for the team. His attacking and defending set pieces was the difference. The only person I didn’t want to beat was [Shrewsbury manager Paul Hurst] Hursty, but Hursty will go on to great things. 

5.49pm BST
17:49

Two-goal hero Richard Wood speaks.  I am speechless. We’ve come so far from last season, it was terrible. To turn it around in the manager great credit. To get a brace has never been heard of. I see my kids crying in the stands. That’s what it’s all about. I am proud to do it for them. 

5.43pm BST
17:43

Richard Wood the two-goal hero, while Shrewsbury experience the desolation of losing in the play-off. Rotherham were the better team.

5.42pm BST
17:42

One, last desperate attack from Shrewsbury but the ball ends up in Rodak’s hands. And that’s it!Updated
at 5.54pm BST


5.40pm BST
17:40

120 mins: A whiff of a chance, but then Richard Wood, our hero, steps in to quell the danger. He can barely stand up straight or walk, but they shall not pass. 

5.39pm BST
17:39

120 mins: There are two added minutes here. 

5.39pm BST
17:39

118 mins: Break on for Shrewsbury? No, Rotherham get men back. And at the other end, Williams weaves into the opposing area. He goes down. Penalty? Don’t be daft. He went down in stages.Updated
at 5.39pm BST


5.37pm BST
17:37

116 mins: Rodak has to come out to claim the ball. Rotherham beginning to camp a little deeply for comfort. They get a break when Godfrey crops down Vaulks, who has stud marks right down the back of his calf. Nasty business.

5.35pm BST
17:35

115 mins: Shrewsbury free-kick now. Whalley’s free-kick went a long way and Rodak had to dig it out. Rotherham’s keeper did well and then Williams helped shut down a danger that is quelled by a silly foul by John-Lewis.

5.34pm BST
17:34

113 mins: Rodman, bandaged up, cramped up, rises to win a header and also smiling. Some stones on the man. 

5.32pm BST
17:32

112 mins: Shrews have played 62 matches this season, more than Liverpool or Manchester City, so it is little shock to see their players going down with cramp. 

5.31pm BST
17:31

111 mins: It’s all Rotherham, still, and that’s bad news for Shrewsbury fans. Their small squad, which was punching above its weight, looks to have seized up.

5.30pm BST
17:30

110 mins: Off goes Joe Newell, the creator of that Wood goal, and on comes Anthony Forde, no slouch himself as an attacker. Paul Warne continuing to be progressive. 

5.28pm BST
17:28

109 mins: Rotherham on the attack. Williams, outstanding since coming on, up against Beckles again, and this time the Shrews defender does well.

5.27pm BST
17:27

108 mins: Here come Shrewsbury. Beckles on the charge. Calls for a pen? No, the opposite. A goal-kick.

5.26pm BST
17:26

107 mins: Will Rotherham sit back on this? They have been on the front foot all game, and that has been the difference.

5.25pm BST
17:25

106 mins: OK, 15 minutes to save the Shrews. And for the Millers to see this out. 

5.23pm BST
17:23

The huddles break and the second half of extra time can begin. The two Pauls can do no more now.

17:22

Jenny Britnell emails in: “c’m on you Shrews.! We are following your commentary - somewhat nervously on slow internet connection in the middle on the English Channel - it will all be over before we know it - literally ..”Sorry to be the bearer of such bad news. 

5.21pm BST
17:21

105 mins: Half-time in extra-time. Credit must go to Joe Newell’s set-piece for that Wood goal. 

5.20pm BST
17:20

105 mins: At the other end, the heroic Wood clears the danger of a Shrewsbury attack. Two minutes added in this period of extra-time.

5.19pm BST
17:19

104 mins: The guilty party there was Shrewsbury’s John-Lewis. He cannot even use tiredness as an excuse, as he was a second-half sub. It was a forward’s attempt to defend. 

5.18pm BST
17:18

Who else but Richard Wood? This time it wasn’t a header, but a centre-forward’s finish from another well-worked free-kick.Updated
at 5.36pm BST


5.16pm BST
17:16

102 mins: Sadler yellow-carded for a tackle on Williams. The referee recognised its cynicism. 

5.15pm BST
17:15

101 mins: Nolan knocked over, by Lavery, to ease a bit of pressure in extra-time. 

5.14pm BST
17:14

99 mins: Newell’s free-kick is high, and Dean Henderson again comes for the ball to get it clear. He is never slow in coming forward. Eventually, Towell gets a shot in that flies miles over. 

5.12pm BST
17:12

97 mins: A break in play, as goalscorer Rodman has bleeding from his bonce. 

5.11pm BST
17:11

96 mins: Whalley’s corner is cleared. Ryan Williams on the run. Whalley commits the foul, and he is on a yellow card. This referee has let plenty go without being as, well, negligent as Anthony Taylor in the Championship game. 

5.10pm BST
17:10

95 mins: Williams ran at Beckles, but this time the Shrewsbury defender did his job well. Godfrey surges to the byline and wins a corner at the other end.

5.08pm BST
17:08

94 mins: Penalties have a magnetic pull on these occasions and it is difficult to see beyond them at this point. 

5.07pm BST
17:07

93 mins: Sadler makes a hurried clearance. Rotherham piling it on again, but Joe Newell’s shot is poor.

5.06pm BST
17:06

91 mins: It’s leggy stuff, as might be expected, with Omar Beckles, who looks cream crackered, lamping the ball into touch when he had team-mates on. Rotherham will look to target Beckles, though they have done that all day, to be fair.

5.04pm BST
17:04

Here we go, then. The team talks are done. Shrewsbury have made all three subs, while Rotherham have one to go.Updated

5.03pm BST
17:03

Michael Connellan emails in: “Hi John, Great coverage of the game - thanks. Thought I’d point out that Richard Wood is not just a leader on the pitch. Off the pitch, he supports a type 1 diabetes charity, JDRF, following the diagnosis of his son with the condition. Nacho has type 1 diabetes and he won the Champions League yesterday.”

4.58pm BST
16:58

And extra-time beckons. Some tired legs around and some heavy duty work for the masseurs to come. And the managers. Which of the two Pauls can outsmart the other? 

4.57pm BST
16:57

90 mins+5: What a save! Williams cut in from the right-hand side. His shot was arrowing into the goal...but Henderson got a firm hand to it, somehow. That was the one!

4.56pm BST
16:56

90 mins+4: Shrewsbury digging in, and Jay Emmanuel’s efforts to force a run down the wing are stopped by a series of agricultural tackles. Updated
at 4.56pm BST


4.54pm BST
16:54

90 mins+3: Rotherham the team pushing the hardest here. 

4.54pm BST
16:54

90 mins+2: Nsiala came across to stop a Williams run. Another Rotherham corner. Henderson came a long way to get nowhere near it, and is lucky that Will Vaulks cannot get a shot on target.

4.52pm BST
16:52

90 mins: 5 (FIVE!) minutes of added time has been declared, and both teams look tired enough to concede. 

4.51pm BST
16:51

88 mins: Wood was the target again for a Rotherham corner, but Riley got in his way.

4.50pm BST
16:50

87 mins: Chances at both ends. Whalley has a shot saved by Rodak and when Smith looked to be pushing through, John Nolan’s tackle stopped him. 

4.48pm BST
16:48

86 mins: Michael Hann tweets in again. Our original estimate not far off, then. @JohnBrewin_ They’ve just announced the attendance. 26,218.Updated
at 4.49pm BST


4.48pm BST
16:48

85 mins: Oof, close. Rotherham’s Smith went close, but just as he seemed to have to got past Henderson, the goalkeeper managed to get a claw on the ball. 

4.47pm BST
16:47

84 mins: In these times of high-profile goalkeeping mistakes, thoughts go out to the goalies. 

4.46pm BST
16:46

83 mins: An understandable slowing of hostilities at this late stage. Here’s when the cramp starts appearing, and as Kevin Keegan famously said, that is worse than a broken leg. 

4.44pm BST
16:44

81 mins: Into the last ten minutes we go, and it’s hugely difficult to work out which way this one is going. Extra-time seems like it would be the favourite. 

4.43pm BST
16:43

80 mins: Michael Hann, a colleague at Guardian Towers, tweets in: “Am at Wembley. Can’t help feeling they would get better crowds with better pricing. £80 for our seats among Shrews fans at side. Yes, it’s Wembley but it’s also L1 football.”

4.42pm BST
16:42

79 mins: Lavery again in the mix as Rotherham try to find their winner, but John-Lewis, at the other end, has a shot on goal from the right side of the box. Rodak dived and was beaten, but so was the post.Updated
at 4.51pm BST


4.39pm BST
16:39

77 mins: Shrewsbury at last have a chance to get on the attack, but fail to make much of their chance to either get breathing space or find a potential winner.

4.38pm BST
16:38

76 mins: Lavery is finding the same space that David Ball found in the first half, and has another effort on goal. 

4.37pm BST
16:37

75 mins: Rotherham sub: On comes Williams for Taylor. 

4.36pm BST
16:36

73 mins: And Lavery should have scored! In an inside left position, he had the goal gaping and tried a chip. Vaulks now fires one in. Rotherham have recovered their dominance now.

4.34pm BST
16:34

72 mins: Final Shrewsbury sub: Joe Riley has come on for Bolton at right-back.

4.34pm BST
16:34

70 mins: Rotherham sub: Wood, so excellent in that first half hour, got tired and has left the field to be replaced by Lavery.

4.32pm BST
16:32

69 mins: Rotherham piling it back on now. Vaulks’ shot squirts through and Henderson makes the save when he was unsighted.

4.31pm BST
16:31

67 mins: That Shrewsbury goal brought back memories of well-worked free-kick, but mine has failed me. Initially thought it was like this Brolin goal from 1994 but there was actually one more touch by Shrews."

Zlatan Ibrahimovic received a red card for slapping an opposing player in the head but the LA Galaxy were still able to eke out a 1-0 win over the Montreal Impact without their marquee acquisition.Impact defender Michael Petrasso stepped on the 36-year-old’s foot in the 40th minute of the match in Montreal and the towering Swede retaliated with a slap to the back of Petrasso’s head. Both players fell to the ground in an apparent effort to win the sympathy of referee Ismail Elfath but after a review of the video, Petrasso was shown a yellow card and the former Juventus, Barcelona and Manchester United striker a red. Despite the Impact controlling the ball for 56% of the game and taking 15 more shots, Galaxy’s 10 men prevailed when Ola Kamara scored the only goal of the game in the 75th minute. The win ends a four-game skid for the Galaxy who are now 4-6-1 while the loss is the third straight for the 3-9-0 Impact, who will need to find some goals in the remaining 24 games of the season if they hope to make the playoffs.Ibrahimovic made a Hollywood entrance during his first game for the Galaxy in March when he scored twice, including the winner, in a thrilling 4-3 victory over local rivals LAFC but has added only one more goal since. Sweden’s record goalscorer, Ibrahimovic retired from international football after Euro 2016 and, despite flirting with a comeback, will miss this year’s World Cup in Russia."
football,"José Mourinho’s need to play the underdog and the dismissal of safe-standing are among our annoyances this season

Welcome to theguardian.com review of the 2017-18 Premier League season. We have nominated some contenders for this category but this is just to get the discussion going: offer your suggestions below the line …The increased financial rewards have not stopped the Premier League’s inequality from increasing. The top six teams are almost playing in their own mini-league now and it has been impossible for anyone to break into their exclusive club. Arsenal easily saw off Burnley’s attempt to nab sixth place, Everton are well off the pace despite spending heavily last summer and teams in mid-table are far too close to the bottom three for comfort. But the league’s diminishing competitiveness does not seem to be a concern for the elite. They are motivated only by greed and self-interest. How else to explain their attempt to grab a larger share of the overseas television money? Or that they are kept apart on the first and last weekends of the season? The chutzpah is astonishing, especially as this has been the fourth consecutive season without an exciting title race. Do not be surprised if apathy rises. You have to hand it to José Mourinho: he is the master of managing expectations. He is in charge of one of the biggest teams in the world. He broke the world record to sign Paul Pogba two summers ago, he has a £75m striker, the best goalkeeper in the world and Alexis Sánchez reportedly earns £350,000 a week. Yet Mourinho still feels the need to play the underdog. He claimed that Manchester United lacked “football heritage” after negative tactics backfired against Sevilla in the Champions League and is already getting his excuses in early before next season, saying that it will be tough to catch City if the champions earn more than 90 points again. Presumably Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Luke Shaw will be to blame if English football’s most successful team fall short, but have United’s fans considered that Mourinho might also need to buck up his ideas? Or have they drunk the Kool-Aid? The point here is not whether VAR will help football. It is more that people have been too quick to criticise what is obviously a work in progress. The system has struggled to win over its critics and even those who are supportive of VAR have experienced doubts about its merits during its trial run in the FA Cup. The biggest problem has been a failure to provide enough communication to people in the ground, which has led to confusion and frustration when games are held up for no apparent reason, and there was plenty of annoyance when technology dominated a farcical tie between Liverpool and West Brom in January. Yet we could at least give it a chance before writing it off once and for all. Perhaps it isn’t the answer and maybe the biggest contribution it will make to the sport is reminding us that football games are more entertaining when they are allowed to flow. But if you are prepared not to have more technology, remember not to erupt like Gianluigi Buffon when referees make split-second decisions without the benefit of a replay. Arsène Wenger has hinted that a European Super League might not be far off and the former Arsenal manager (that feels odd to write) has also suggested that one way to make the Premier League more interesting might be to cut it to 16 teams. Looking at the relegation battle, he might have a point. There were some poor teams in the bottom half and yet Stoke, Swansea and West Brom still went down without much of a fight. The teams who survived had little to celebrate. Tracey Crouch has apologised for saying that only a “vocal minority” of fans wanted standing areas to be reinstated in English football but the sports minister also said that there are no plans to change the legislation at the moment. Standing is not allowed in the top two divisions and West Brom’s appeal to introduce safe-standing at the Hawthorns was rejected by the government last month. But the idea that standing caused the Hillsborough disaster has been debunked and many clubs in the Premier League have looked into building standing areas, with Chelsea, Everton and Tottenham looking into incorporating it at their new stadiums. It works at Celtic and 88% of Liverpool fans are in favour of it. Why stand in opposition? "

It is the end of the Premier League season and inevitably it will be goodbye from some of the game’s big names, whether or not they realise it just yet. Not everyone gets to know when the curtain will fall on a top-flight career; some have everything planned, others are overtaken by events, while a few will rage against the dying of the light by seeking new contracts elsewhere. But when the 27th edition of the Premier League commences in August it is likely one or two familiar faces will be missing. Here are some of the high-profile performers whose Match of the Day days are in danger of drawing to a close – or already have done. whose Match of the Day days are in danger of drawing to a close – or already have done.Definitely leaving Manchester City at the moment and hopeful of signing a short contract with another Premier League club in order to see out the last two years of his career in England. Two years is the 34-year-old’s own estimate and he is even advertising the fact that he will be fresh for next season as Ivory Coast will not be competing at the World Cup. Found it difficult to get a look-in with City this season, though not every up-and-coming Premier League side are as well stocked with bright young talent as Pep Guardiola’s City. There is no doubt Touré did the job he was brought in to do in his eight years in Manchester – the club wanted a Champions League winner in their midst to add gravitas and experience to their ambition – and he might yet be picked up by a team looking to boost their Premier League credibility.Is only halfway through a two-year contract at his boyhood club, but the return to Merseyside has perhaps not gone as well as expected – what exactly was expected? – and one last move to MLS looks increasingly likely. Rooney could have done that a year ago, but when the opportunity to rejoin Everton presented itself he found it impossible to resist. No one can blame him for that, but Everton have changed managers since, and neither Ronald Koeman nor Sam Allardyce found it particularly easy to identify a role for the former Manchester United player. At 32 he should have a couple of years left, though pace is everything in the Premier League and the lesson seems to be that if you are no longer quick enough to play up front you will not necessarily find it any easier to move back to midfield.With a release clause of £12m and a considerable amount of talent, Stoke’s Swiss winger is already attracting attention from a number of Premier League clubs, so this might not be a permanent loss. He could disappear abroad, however. He has already played for Bayern Munich and Inter, so this is the time to acknowledge one of the best left feet in the business. Not everyone’s idea of a team player but at his best he is brilliant to watch and at 26 he still has the potential to shine if a leading side can offer him a regular place.Contracted to Stoke until 2019, by which time he will be 38, the well-travelled striker confessed after the Potters were relegated that he did not know what the future held. Because of his age it is hard to see another Premier League destination for one of England’s most easily recognised players, yet he proved surprisingly resilient for Stoke, where he kept coming up with the goals despite advancing years. Crouch is now being linked with Rangers, though so is almost anyone Steven Gerrard has ever played alongside. If Crouch does leave the Premier League, he does so with a proud record of 169 goals and the most headed goals in the competition’s history.Not quite a household name after a single season at Stamford Bridge, though with even Cesc Fàbregas pointing out that Chelsea have not been scoring enough goals it seems the club’s search for an effective replacement for Diego Costa will begin again. The £58m Morata is being linked with Juventus, partly because he played in Turin before joining Real Madrid and partly because he has not exactly embraced English football with both arms, despite scoring 15 goals. Antonio Conte has frequently selected Morata on the bench, but even as an impact substitute he now finds himself in the shadow of Olivier Giroud.Hanging up his boots at Manchester United to join the coaching staff, and according to José Mourinho the only player who will need replacing this summer. A reliable midfielder with over 650 Premier League appearances for West Ham, Tottenham and United, Carrick is also the only English player besides Wayne Rooney to achieve all six of the honours possible in club football. Despite Mourinho’s flattering comments about the hole he will leave in the side the 36-year-old has been used extremely sparingly this season, his defensive duties having been largely taken over by Nemanja Matic. Carrick was a midfielder of similar discipline, willing to stay back and protect the back four, and if anything his distribution and ball retention were superior."

Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal have all offered contracts to Melayro Bogarde, nephew of former Chelsea defender Winston, with the defender free to sign his first professional deal when he turns 16 on 28 May.Liverpool and Chelsea are also monitoring the Feyenoord defender, though neither club has opened negotiations.Bogarde is considered one of Europe’s prime talents due to his physique, height and ball-playing skills, with Pep Guardiola viewing him as having a similar technical potential to John Stones, who he signed in the summer of 2016.The Manchester City manager has invited Bogarde to visit the club’s City Football Academy facility and Bogarde has received similar invitations from Arsenal and United, who enjoy good relations with Feyenoord. Two years ago, United signed Tahith Chong from the Dutch side, with the Caracao-born winger winning the Jimmy Murphy youth team player of the year award this month.Due to his age negotiations for Bogarde’s signature could not begin until he was 15½. These are now advanced regarding City, United and Liverpool with the player expected to choose the club he believes will offer the best chance of him progressing to the first team.United’s Dutch scout, Henny de Regt, hired by the club when Louis van Gaal was manager, has been monitoring Bogarde all season, as have his counterparts from City and Liverpool.RB Leipzig, who are sixth in the Bundesliga, also retain a firm interest. Paul Mitchell, their head of recruitment, watched Bogarde around a fortnight ago when Feyenoord U17s played Ajax U17s. Mitchell held a similar role at Tottenham before leaving for Leipzig this year."

Barcelona’s hopes of an unbeaten La Liga campaign were ended in their penultimate game as they lost 5-4 at Levante. The champions had gone 36 games unbeaten but trailed 5-1 after 56 minutes and their dramatic fightback came up short.Emmanuel Boateng’s hat-trick and Enis Bardhi’s double put Levante in charge and, despite Philippe Coutinho completing a hat-trick of his own and Luis Suárez scoring a penalty, Barça’s bid for history came up short.Fifth-bottom Levante had won their last four matches but were not meant to be a threat as Barça, who rested Lionel Messi, aimed to become the first team to remain unbeaten in a 38-game La Liga season.But the hosts took the lead through Boateng after nine minutes and the Ghanaian rounded Marc-André ter Stegen to add a second in the 31st minute.Coutinho pulled one back seven minutes before the break with a deflected effort from the edge of the area but Levante started the second half in style. Bardhi found the top corner 33 seconds after the break and Boateng completed his treble three minutes later after being played in by Antonio Luna.Bardhi then added his second to make it 5-1, curling the ball into the far-left corner from Roger’s pass.Coutinho reduced the deficit three minutes later from close range and completed his first Barça hat-trick with 26 minutes left with another deflected effort from range.Suárez converted from the spot in the 71st minute after Sergio Busquets was fouled from a corner to make it 5-4 but Ernesto Valverde’s side could not find a late leveller and keep their run going.In Italy Juventus wrapped up their seventh successive Serie A title and fourth league and cup double in a row with one match to spare when a 0-0 draw at Roma gave them the point they needed.The Turin side, who won the Coppa Italia on Wednesday with a 4-0 win over Milan at the same Stadio Olimpico, took a four-point lead over second-placed Napoli with one match to play.Napoli will finish as runners-up for the second time in the last three seasons after winning 2-0 at Sampdoria in a match briefly interrupted in the second half because of anti-Neapolitan chants by home supporters.Juventus maintained their perfect domestic record in their four seasons under Massimiliano Allegri. They have also reached two Champions League finals in that period.Roma, already qualified for next season’s Champions League, dominated the first half and Edin Dzeko and Radja Nainggolan just missed the target as the hosts looked dangerous.Paulo Dybala had the ball in the net two minutes after half-time but he was fractionally offside and Roma were reduced to 10 men when Nainggolan, already booked, was sent off for an ugly foul on Dybala in the 68th minute.

Sunderland’s new owner, Stewart Donald, has voiced concern for the fate of his club’s women’s team and indicated that Melanie Copeland and her players may no longer be regarded as an unwanted drain on resources.On Monday Sunderland Ladies became the biggest losers in the Football Association’s restructure of the English women’s leagues when they lost top-flight status, were refused a second-tier slot, and found themselves left hoping to be accommodated on the third rung of the domestic pyramid.It seems likely that Donald will enter the FA’s appeal process and attempt to get a side who finished seventh in this season’s Women’s Super League repositioned in the newly rebranded Championship (second division).“At this stage it doesn’t matter who is at fault, it’s the ladies and girls that suffer so we just need a sensible resolution to the situation,” Donald said. “The ladies’ application was one of the first things I inquired about when we took the club over.”Given the strong suspicions that the appeal process – to be concluded by 11 June – could prove to be a cosmetic, box-ticking exercise, the odds are that Sunderland will almost certainly have to restart in the third tier.Even so, it is not lost on Donald or Baroness Sue Campbell, the FA’s head of women’s football, that Sunderland produced seven of Phil Neville’s current England side, including Lucy Bronze, who has just won the Champions League with Lyon, and the national captain, Manchester City’s Steph Houghton.Campbell, aware that there is now no top-tier women’s team north of Manchester, on Tuesday pledged to address the situation. “Sunderland haven’t had the support they’ve needed from the men’s club for some time,” she said. “But we’re not going to abandon the north-east. We’re going to a put a talent academy for 16- to 20-year-olds at Northumbria University and build again from the bottom up.“If we can make sure that talent pathway is still there we can then, hopefully, work with a major club in the north-east to rebuild a women’s senior team.”With Ellis Short, Donald’s predecessor, having lost interest in Copeland’s side, Sunderland declined to apply for a place in either next season’s all-professional Super League top tier or the part-time Championship when, late last year, the FA began restructuring the women’s pyramid.Although they entered the second round of bidding in March, assorted rivals, most notably West Ham – who leapfrog from the third to first tier – and the Championship newcomers Manchester United, produced far stronger pitches.Now Donald must resolve the futures of Copeland – admired in FA circles after assisting Neville during England’s recent World Cup qualifiers – and her squad while also deciding how much money he is prepared to invest in a team who lost £424,000 in the year ending July 2017.“In a few years we’ll have a league that’s the envy of the world,” said Campbell. “But Sunderland are a casualty. It’s tough on them.”"

Mark Rudan has been named as Wellington Phoenix’s new head coach, charged with lifting the New Zealand club out of the doldrums after their disappointing 2017-18 A-League season.Phoenix finished ninth, one point above wooden spooners Central Coast, during a tumultuous season that saw previous coach Darije Kalezic sacked in March and interim coach Chris Greenacre take over for the rest of the campaign. Rudan, who captained Sydney FC to the inaugural A-League title in 2006, has made a promising start to his coaching career, winning both NSW Premier League and Australian Premier League titles with Sydney United in 2013 and 2016.His first A-League coaching role is with a club whose licence could be terminated in two seasons if they don’t make substantial improvements to off-field metrics such as crowd and broadcasting figures.Turning around their fortunes on the field is where it will begin for the 42-year-old. “Throughout my playing career and my coaching career, I’ve always kept a keen eye on clubs like this and it’s certainly one that needs to change in a lot of areas,” he said.“Not just the players, but the staff and all stakeholders will understand exactly where we’re heading. It’s not a dictatorship but I want to see a change at the football club.”Phoenix general manager David Dome conceded Kalezic failed to succeed because he wasn’t equipped to cope with the Australasian way of doing things.“It was very important for us to find a coach who understood the Australian and New Zealand culture,” Dome said. “When Mark’s name came across our desk, he stood out as someone who would be that kind of coach, who can do a lot for Wellington.“There are two more years left on our current licence. We all understand that the club needs to succeed, the club needs to perform.”Phoenix chairman Rob Morrison said Rudan’s “passion and desire to make a difference at the club” made him stand out from a number of other applicants for the post, including some with considerable A-League experience. “The feedback on Mark from the people we spoke to, which included some of the most respected and experienced people in Australian football, was universally excellent with all stressing what a talented coach, man manager and determined leader he is,” Morrison said.“Mark is an exciting ‘next generation’ coach, who will bring fresh energy, focus and discipline to the playing group at the club and he can’t wait to stamp his mark upon the A-League.“We are an ‘underdog’ club, we can’t escape that, we have to fight for everything we get and we wanted someone who would buy into what the club faces and is capable of leading that fight and we think Mark is that person.”"

West Ham want to interview Manuel Pellegrini after Shakhtar Donetsk’s Paulo Fonseca ruled himself out of the running to replace David Moyes.The club are hoping to make an appointment by the end of next week after Moyes told David Sullivan, West Ham’s co-owner, he was no longer interested in extending his stay at the London Stadium. The pair had been expected to meet next week but it is understood Moyes has decided to seek new opportunities after growing tired with his treatment.The 55-year-old, whose six-month contract expired on Sunday night, believed he deserved a new deal after preserving West Ham’s Premier League status. Club officials were less sure and it became clear during the season’s final weeks they wanted to speak to other managers before reaching a decision.West Ham did not completely remove Moyes from their thinking, even while they were courting other managers. Sullivan hosted Fonseca and the agent, Jorge Mendes, at his Essex home on Monday afternoon and it is believed positive discussions took place during a 75-minute meeting. Sources had warned, however, that the Shakhtar manager was almost certainly using the talks to flush out better offers and it has since emerged the 45-year-old is expected to renew his contract with the Ukrainian champions.Moyes had run out of patience and his decision to withdraw his candidacy has heightened the pressure on West Ham, who spent much of the season fighting against relegation. While they have indicated a desire to tackle the situation with a clear head, they are aware of the dangers of letting the vacancy remain unfilled for too long and would like to speak to Pellegrini, having already held informal talks with the Chilean.The 64-year-old, who is in charge of Hebei China Fortune, is thought to be interested in a return to Europe. He knows the Premier League well, having led Manchester City to the title in 2014 and the former Real Madrid manager has an impressive pedigree. He is thought to be on a large salary in China and has also been linked with Sevilla.West Ham also admire Newcastle’s Rafael Benítez, who was close to joining them when they replaced Sam Allardyce with Slaven Bilic three years ago. It it will not be easy to prise the Spaniard away from St James’ Park. Benítez’s contract, which has a year left to run, contains a £6m release clause and it is understood there would be additional compensation to pay.West Ham also hope to interview Unai Emery, who has been replaced by Thomas Tuchel at Paris Saint-Germain, while other candidates include Burnley’s Sean Dyche and Huddersfield’s David Wagner.Moyes’s task was to pull West Ham out of the bottom three after replacing Bilic in November and he succeeded in difficult circumstances, finishing 13th. He inherited an unfit, unbalanced squad, received minimal backing in the January transfer window, saw Tony Henry leave as the club’s head of recruitment in January and watched as supporters mounted furious protests against the board during the 3-0 home defeat to Burnley in March.Moyes managed to steady the ship and that calmness under pressure earned him the respect of one of West Ham’s owners, with David Gold backing him. Yet his relationship with David Sullivan was more fragile and both parties started to have misgivings during the season’s final weeks.Moyes, who wanted greater control over transfers, adopted an increasingly bullish tone. He criticised West Ham’s culture of leaks, following his row with Andy Carroll earlier this month, challenged his employers to match his ambition and said the club had to make improvements off the pitch in order to become stronger on it. Yet he did not feel he had Sullivan’s trust.He felt he could provide West Ham with stability and turn them into a top-eight club with the right backing. Now he is waiting for offers. His assistants, Alan Irvine, Stuart Pearce and Billy McKinlay, have also left.Sullivan has targeted a replacement for Henry and is hopeful of appointing a director of football in the next fortnight."

Wayne Rooney will travel to the United States to meet officials at DC United this week, his spokesperson has confirmed. The former England captain, who has one year left on his contract at Everton, has been linked with a move to Washington DC’s MLS team.No deal has been made between Everton and DC United but Rooney is travelling to the US for exploratory talks with permission from Everton. The journey is a fact-finding trip for the 32-year-old and his support staff as they get to know DC United’s set-up. Any transfer, however, would need to meet the approval of Everton.The final decision on any proposed deal would rest with the Premier League club and their new manager. Marco Silva is the leading candidate to succeed Sam Allardyce and Rooney wants to discuss his role under the next manager before making a final decision.Marcel Brands, who becomes Everton’s new director of football on 1 June, has confirmed Allardyce’s replacement needs to assess the squad ahead of any transfer moves. “If we are going to take decisions about players it is important the manager is involved because he is going to work with them every day,” said Brands, recently hired from PSV Eindhoven. “I will take care of the long-term strategy but the first job now is to find a manager as soon as possible and straight away go to work with the squad.”Rooney is currently on holiday in Barbados and will be accompanied on his trip to Washington by his long-time adviser Paul Stretford.News of the visit first emerged in a report in the Washington Post on Wednesday. A spokesperson for the player confirmed that it is to take place in the coming days. Everton have not commented on the news.Rooney rejoined first club Everton last summer after 13 years with Manchester United. He scored 11 goals during the season just finished, including a hat-trick against West Ham in November.Brands, meanwhile, will meet Silva before Everton finalise the appointment of their new manager. The Dutchman will have a powerful and wide-ranging remit at Goodison Park and has outlined his criteria for the new appointment. It may not bode well for the 32-year-old Rooney.“I think it is important that he (the next manager) wants to work in the new philosophy, the new strategy of how we want to work with a director of football. I think it is important that he creates the environment for the long-term, and I think it is important that he is a modern coach. If you think about what Everton’s plans are, I think a modern coach will fit into that profile. Then his philosophy and how he wants to play is important. I think it has to be a coach who wants to work with young players.”"

On a warm July night in Montreal almost 11 years ago Bartosz Bialkowski thought he might feel like this forever. He had just made a brilliant reflex save in the last minute of Poland’s Under-20 World Cup match against South Korea, guaranteeing the point that took his country into the knockout stage. It was some way to celebrate his 20th birthday and back in the dressing room he was a hero, hoisted aloft by a team that had already defeated Brazil and felt giddy at the prospect of a crack at Argentina. “We thought we could do whatever we wanted to do,” the Ipswich goalkeeper remembers of a summer that resembled a coming of age. “It was like we were the gods now.”As it turned out, deific status was not that easy to attain. The career Bialkowski had in mind seemed light years away by 2012 when, going nowhere at Southampton and grievously unfit, the prospect of dropping into non-league seemed scarily real. Bialkowski, though, has turned everything round. He is adored at Portman Road, won a first call-up to the Poland senior team in March and, having been named in the preliminary World Cup squad, stands on the verge of realising a dream that had been fading rapidly.“I never gave up on it,” he says. “But I also realised that I’m 30, 31 in July, and I’d never had any contact from the national team staff so it was disappearing. Then I got the call and it would be amazing, absolutely unbelievable, to go to the World Cup now.”Replacing Lukasz Fabianski for the second half of Poland’s friendly against Nigeria was the fulfilment of a promise, too. Any other hardship Bialkowski has experienced pales in comparison to the death of his father, Marek, in August 2015. Marek was a soldier – “tough, but he was soft inside, too” – and never wavered in supporting Bartosz’s endeavours. He had driven him round the country and, with Bialkowski’s mother, dashed to be with him when thugs gave him two black eyes after a match with Gornik Zabrze. Bialkowski arrived at Marek’s side in time to say goodbye and vowed to honour him by playing for Poland.“In my final chat with him, at the hospital, I promised him I would get a call-up and play for my country,” he says. “And I managed it. I wasn’t nervous going out on the pitch but I was proud, so proud. I just thought: ‘This moment is for my dad,’ because we waited for me to get that call-up and unfortunately he didn’t see it. Maybe he was watching.”Bialkowski’s arrival in the Poland camp made for a mini reunion of the class of 2007. Grzegorz Krychowiak and Wojciech Szczesny were among those team-mates who tossed him into the air that evening in Canada. “As soon as I walked in there I knew I was in the right place,” he says; in training there was the bonus of facing Robert Lewandowski. “He doesn’t smash his shots, he was just calmly putting them into the corner of the net. Obviously I tried to do my best, and saved a few, but he is incredible.”With the Under-20s Bialkowski was captain and, between games, boys would sometimes be boys. He remembers a mishap that befell Krychowiak – “We went on rollercoasters and it didn’t feel good afterwards. I think he fell sick and missed the South Korea game” – but relished the camaraderie. Krychowiak had scored the winner against Brazil but a Freddy Adu-inspired 6-1 thrashing by the USA left them grateful for that stop against Korea. They were downed by Sergio Agüero and Ángel Di María in the round of 16 but the launchpad to bigger things seemed set.Bialkowski had recovered from a cruciate injury to make eight Championship appearances for Southampton in 2006-07; he seemed on track, although a different route had briefly presented itself two years previously when, as a 17-year-old at Gornik, the chance of a lifetime came and went.“I had a five-year contract offer from Inter Milan,” he says. “But I had to sign with an Italian agent to do it and I already had a big agency, IMG. They told me not to sign anything because they had clubs like Arsenal and Manchester United for me, so I didn’t and then obviously those offers weren’t there. I went on trial at Wigan and Rangers, nothing really happened and my contract with Gornik expired. I was meant to be one of the biggest prospects in Poland and I ended up without a club.”A trial at Hearts brought him into contact with their then-manager George Burley and goalkeeping coach Malcolm Webster; he joined them when they moved to Southampton and things began well enough before, hindered by injury and unable to displace Kelvin Davis, the opportunities dried up.“I thought: ‘I need to do something with myself,’” he says. “I needed to go out and play games, because otherwise I was going to drop out of the league. My diet was shocking at the time; I felt too comfortable, I wasn’t playing so thought I didn’t need to train as much. Thankfully I realised it at the right time, lost some weight and tried to prepare for the summer.”I’ve never felt as bad after a game as I did after Hull; it was something none of us had ever experiencedNotts County took a chance on him; he rewarded them with two outstanding seasons in League One and then Webster, by now at Ipswich, advised Mick McCarthy to sign him in 2014. Four years in Suffolk have brought three supporters’ player of the year trophies; last season his performances were a uniting factor for Ipswich fans amid discontent that contributed to McCarthy’s departure.“It wasn’t easy, the atmosphere,” Bialkowski says, with the team jeered during March’s 3-0 home defeat by Hull. “It was tough. I don’t think he deserved [such criticism] because he did a really good job but I understand the fans want to be entertained and see us playing well. I’ve never felt as bad after a game as I did after Hull; it was something none of us had ever experienced.”Ipswich have replaced McCarthy with Shrewsbury’s Paul Hurst and Bialkowski’s future will be near the top of the new manager’s intray. He and his family are settled locally; the fact is, though, that he should be in the Premier League and time is against him. “If the right offer comes in for the club and for me, then I need to discuss it with my family,” he says.Crystal Palace were keen in January and others will show their hands. Bialkowski is in competition with Roma’s Lukasz Skorupski for Poland’s final goalkeeping spot and, if the Stadio Olimpico seems a better World Cup breeding ground than the Championship, it is worth noting Skorupski played 90 minutes’ football all season.“I came a long way to be where I am,” Bialkowski says. “A few years ago I wouldn’t have thought I could be in this situation so I need to do everything I can.” Football, with its penchant for circularity, may make a god of him yet."

As Zinedine Zidane’s Real Madrid side arrived in Kiev to face Liverpool in the Champions League final he admitted he is ready for chaos and insisted that, if there was pressure, they would be all the better for it.“Today and tomorrow will never happen again; we will live other experiences but never this, so we have to make the most of it,” the Frenchman said. “And if there’s a bit of pressure, no problem. It’s life, it’s better like that – a bit of emotion. We’re humans and humans are pure emotion. With pressure it’s even nicer.”Jürgen Klopp had said that Madrid can live with chaos. That perhaps sets them apart from previous opponents Liverpool have faced and he also talked about how this was a meeting of two coaches accused of not being strong tactically. For Zidane it is a recurring theme and, when he was asked if he felt valued as a manager, he replied: “Yes,” before pausing, smiling and adding: “Well, sometimes not but that’s life.”He added: “We have had chaos before and we will have tomorrow for sure. Football is simple: there are two teams and you have to know how you can damage them and control how much they damage you. We have to try to minimise that [chaos] as much as possible and suffer as little as we can. But we will suffer.”Zidane claimed that in a final there is no favourite, describing the game as “50-50”, and dismissed suggestions that his team could be undone by over-confidence, amid a sense in Spain that anything other than a Madrid victory would be a major shock. “Don’t worry,” he said. “In the dressing room we don’t think that. People can say what they like but we know that’s not the way it is. We’re not favourites and nor are they.”His captain, Sergio Ramos, suggested that Klopp’s claim that Madrid were like a “Swiss watch” was an attempt to distract them. “They’re like a Swiss watch too,” he said. “We have to be focused on not conceding and reducing the danger of their world class players.”A few weeks ago, Zidane had said that Cristiano Ronaldo, injured at the time, would be at 150% for this final. Asked if he was there yet, the Madrid manager said: “He looks good to me – and if it’s 140%, no problem.”Ramos said that Madrid’s players were in great shape. “Everyone is ready, there are no injuries, we’ve been training incredibly well and we have extraordinary motivation, we’re all like miuras [fighting bulls],” he said."

Know ye by this press conference that we, the FA, consent to the contracting of World Cup squad-ship between our dearly beloved Gareth and his brave 23-man selection. Although obviously not Jack, Joe, Adam or Jonjo who are on this occasion gutted to miss out, but for whom the door is never closed, and all the lads are still very much in the frame going forwards.There was an unavoidable air of ceremony about Gareth Southgate’s World Cup squad camera call on Thursday morning. On a bright, brittle late-spring day Wembley was already hung with its own Cup final bunting before a day that has the feel of a royal wedding in any case, with the usual buttonholes and dignitaries and that air of slightly chintzy national holiday.With the England squad announced the day before this was a more formal occasion deep in the bowels of Wembley Stadium, the first note in the incidental music of promises, war cries, apologies and farewells that tends to soundtrack every England tournament summer.And so enter Gareth to a fusillade of camera flashes, dressed in sports coat and slacks, hair slicked touchingly to one side like a 1930s intellectual. England’s manager has come a long way in the art of public speaking since the days when he was described by one wag as resembling an anteater that is only just realising it shouldn’t be able to talk.This was in many ways a faultless, likable, entirely engaging performance from an increasingly coherent and convincing England manager. For half an hour Southgate spoke with sound good sense, offering perfectly pitched reasoning for every decision, every close call – to the extent you almost missed the old hysterical jingoism, the doomed sweating hopes of his predecessors.Clearly Southgate has found his tone, his managerial register. It just so happens – but then, this is England – that his tone is funereal, sombre, valedictory, with England’s manager coming across less like the curator of a piece of high-summer light entertainment, and more a long-suffering country vet who appears at the door in the wee hours in his waxed jacket to tell you your dog’s been run over.Perhaps it’s even something grander and more martial. Because Southgate spent the opening 15 minutes of England’s great World Cup adventure speaking in hushed, elegiac tones about players who aren’t actually going in the clipped, formal tones of a decorated general offering tribute to the fallen of the Somme.Jonjo, Adam, Jack. All so fine. All so very young. The conversation with Joe Hart “had not been easy”, Southgate admitted. On the topic of Jack Wilshere he said perhaps the most illuminating thing any England manager has come out with in recent memory, admitting that the job of the manager is to “hide as best you can the weaknesses of the team”.Beyond this there was a lot of talk of starting again and offering hope. It is easy to forget in the humdrum churn of fixtures that this is still a national team that sees itself in recovery, waiting for the tide to turn, with Gareth stood at the end of his jetty as smoke wreathes the horizon, seeing hope in that small-ship flotilla ranged across the bay.He was excellent on the topic of experience versus youth: “We talk a lot about experience. But if that experience is a bad one it can be damaging.” No England manager has said this before either. And it’s true.Southgate was also nicely spiky on the warnings from certain high-profile pundits of club cliques cropping up in the squad. “Didn’t happen in ’96,” Southgate shrugged, very quietly pulling rank on the serial quarter-finalists of the golden generation.There was some interesting talk towards the end of his friendship with Pep Guardiola, a reference to “long talks with Jürgen”, and a note of pleasure, even a rare smile, at the mention of Trent Alexander-Arnold.At the end of which it is hard not to feel a slight stirring of hope. If not for the team then for a manager who has to date been empowered rather than diminished by the role.This is no longer the second-most important job in the country. But it is surely the weirdest, and just as likely as it ever was to pull you out of shape.Fabio Capello arrived a swaggering iron general and left an oddly mute, isolated figure, like a man seen silently bellowing and pointing behind a triple-glazed glass door. Roy Hodgson’s departure was a more tender affair, washing up the day after the collapse in Nice looking like the lead role in a piece of French existential cinema, hollow-eyed and shaky, posing strange philosophical questions.Southgate feels distinct from that, the first Premier League player to manage England, the first really modern person to manage England. There is a steeliness about him and a trenchant intelligence in his dealings, from dropping Dele Alli and getting just the right response, to packing off Wayne Rooney, to picking a team that basically reflects everything he wants to do and nothing else.You sense Southgate won’t be crushed by this. Just as for once England will set off on the long march east with sights set neither too high nor too low; and with the chance, even, for the odd high note before these sombre summer ceremonials are done."

Last May, the commemorative T-shirts celebrated a “Le6end”. This year, Juventus went with “My7h”. Even as players popped champagne corks for the second time in four days at Rome’s Stadio Olimpico, it was tempting to imagine a marketing team somewhere planning the slogans and hashtags for the next round of celebrations in 12 months.Seven consecutive Scudetti. No club had even won six in a row before the Bianconeri embarked on their present run. Across Europe’s top five leagues, only Lyon, at the start of this century, have enjoyed such an uninterrupted spell of domestic dominance. Even then, they did not pair Ligue 1 success with cup triumphs. Juve’s 0-0 draw with Roma on Sunday sealed an unprecedented fourth straight Serie A and Coppa Italia double.Whether that is an achievement to celebrate, or a cause for lament might depend on your perspective. The front page of Monday’s La Repubblica sport section reminded us: “Hegemonies do not help a system to grow.”Beneath that headline, Angelo Carotenuto drew links between the advent of pay TV and a diminished competitiveness: accusing clubs of prioritising comfortable economics over competitive championships. Even in Spain, he noted, where a duopoly exists, other clubs have found success in Europe.There is merit to such arguments, and it is true that too few Italian clubs have shown the ambition Juventus did in building their own ground at the start of this decade, as well as adapting in other ways to the modern commercial environment. Since moving into what is now the Allianz Stadium, Juventus have won the league every year and increased their annual revenues almost three-fold.And yet, in this specific season, is it fair to put the Old Lady’s success down to a lack of competition? Napoli’s title challenge fell apart at the crucial moment, but with a victory over Sampdoria they nevertheless reached 88 points: a club record in Serie A. If they win at home to Crotone on the final weekend, they will become the first team to fail to win the Scudetto with more than 90.Juventus are too strong, too unerringly consistent. Finances have skewed the playing field, but we ought not let that obscure the fact that their achievement is astonishing. The wealthiest clubs will generally prevail in football, but it is not true that they always do – see Monaco and Leicester.Perhaps, if Juventus were still performing as poorly in Europe, their achievements might be easier to dismiss. But this team has been to two of the past three Champions League finals and was eliminated this year by a last-minute goal away at the Bernabéu.It is the resilience of this team that marks it apart. Juventus had been atrocious in the first leg against Madrid, yet somehow attacked the return game with the conviction of a side that still believed it could find a way through.Domestically, they always do. Juventus were four points behind Napoli when they travelled there in December. The Partenopei were playing the better football. Massimiliano Allegri had his team dig in and grind out an uninspiring but nerveless 1-0 victory.Similarly, when Napoli beat them in Turin and seemed to blow the title race wide open, Juventus refused to yield. From 2-1 down to Inter in the 87th minute at San Siro one week later, they emerged with a win.Napoli manager Maurizio Sarri defined that as the moment when the race ended. His team had been watching at their hotel in Florence. Deflated, they slumped to a 3-0 defeat against Fiorentina. It was an almost identical scenario to the one in March, when Juventus stole an injury-time win out of nowhere at Lazio, before Napoli imploded against Roma.In the truly essential moments, Juventus deliver. That is a testament to Massimiliano Allegri. He is a man who prefers to play down his own input, arguing that a manager can only improve or damage his team’s performance by 5%. Looking on his four years at Juventus, it is hard to agree. Yes, the resources outstrip all their rivals, yet he has also dealt with a constantly shifting squad, key players leaving every summer he has been at the helm.Since 2014, Juventus have bid farewell to Andrea Pirlo, Arturo Vidal, Paul Pogba, Carlos Tevez, Álvaro Morata and Leonardo Bonucci, to name but a few. Allegri has adapted and reinvented each season, never seeming to rush in the new arrivals but typically getting the most out of them by the end.He never even found a settled formation this time around. In 37 league games, Juventus have used 36 different line-ups. Along the way, Allegri found ways to integrate Federico Bernardeschi, Mattia De Sciglio and Wojciech Szczesny. He took a slowly-slowly approach with Douglas Costa, and now has him looking like this team’s brightest star.“I will need to speak to the directors,” said Allegri when asked if he planned to stay, amid reports linking him with Chelsea and Arsenal. “Tomorrow I’m going to the seaside but if they don’t send me away then I will be back next year … Some people will leave, some will arrive. Whatever happens we want more victories.”Among those departing will be Gigi Buffon, barring any late reversal of his decision to retire. This was the goalkeeper’s ninth Serie A title – excluding those revoked as a result of Calciopoli – a record no other player can equal. Yet the fact that he did not play on Sunday, leaving space for Szczesny, was a reminder of how this team has worked to plan ahead throughout this era of dominance.Juventus’s summer transfer campaign is already well under way, with Emre Can expected to arrive from Liverpool, along with Mattia Caldara and Leonardo Spinazzola from Atalanta. More will follow. Nowhere is it written that this run must end at seven. The Old Lady has no plans to abdicate her throne.• Roma will also return to the Champions League, but we don’t know which team will join them. At least Lazio had the twin excuses of playing against a Crotone side fighting for survival, and without Ciro Immobile and Luis Alberto. Inter were beaten 2-1 at home by Sassuolo. Nevertheless, they can take fourth if they win at Lazio.• Milan and Atalanta will take the final Europa League spots, barring a defeat for the latter, and a seven-goal swing to Fiorentina. The Viola lost their cool on what was supposed to be a day to celebrate Davide Astori, losing 1-0 at home to Cagliari (whom the defender also represented) in a game that ended with scuffles on the pitch and both Fiorentina midfielder Jordan Veretout and manager Stefano Pioli sent off.• Cagliari’s win lifted them out of the relegation zone and, combined with victories for Udinese and Chievo, dumped Crotone back into 18th spot.• Sampdoria’s game at home to Napoli was halted for several minutes in response to discriminatory chants from the home support towards people from Naples. Samp’s owner, Massimo Ferrero, even walked out to plead with fans and appeared to be heeded, although only after being abused himself.Benevento 1-0 Genoa, Inter 1-2 Sassuolo, Bologna 1-2 Chievo, Crotone 2-2 Lazio, Fiorentina 0-1 Cagliari, Torino 2-1 Spal, Verona 0-1 Udinese, Atalanta 1-1 Milan, Roma 0-0 Juventus, Sampdoria 0-2 Napoli"

Niko Kovac left Eintracht Frankfurt the perfect parting gift with victory against his future employers Bayern Munich in the DFB-Pokal final. Kovac delivered the cup, and with it European football next season, in his final game in charge before replacing Jupp Heynckes as Bayern manager this summer as Frankfurt won 3-1 in Berlin.Ante Rebic scored either side of Robert Lewandowski’s equaliser, with his second goal after 82 minutes surviving a VAR check by the referee after Bayern appealed for a handball in the build-up. That was not the end of the replay drama, however, as Frankfurt survived another review in injury time when the referee decided that Kevin-Prince Boateng’s kick on Javi Martínez was not worthy of a penalty.With Bayern still seething and their goalkeeper Sven Ulreich up for a corner, Frankfurt broke and the substitute Mijat Gacinovic raced clear of two opponents to roll the ball into the empty net and spark wild celebrations with his team-mates and supporters.While it was the perfect send-off for Kovac, it denied Heynckes a Bundesliga and cup double on his farewell as Frankfurt claimed their first title for 30 years following defeat in the final 12 months ago. Bayern will feel two huge decisions went against them and were left to rue chances from Lewandowski and Mats Hummels which struck the crossbar.Real Madrid blew a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with Villarreal in their final La Liga match before the Champions League final against Liverpool. The Real coach, Zinedine Zidane, handed a debut to his 20-year-old son Luca as first-choice goalkeeper Keylor Navas was rested before the European clash in Kiev on 26 May, but he otherwise named a strong side.Gareth Bale, deployed in a central role, broke the deadlock after 11 minutes to score for the fourth La Liga match in a row, with Cristiano Ronaldo adding a second just after the half hour to put the visitors in control. Villarreal, though, mounted an unlikely comeback when the substitute Roger Martínez fired in with 19 minutes left before another sub, Samu Castillejo, beat the offside trap, rounded Zidane and secured a dramatic draw. The result means Real will finish third behind the champions Barcelona and second-placed Atlético Madrid, who host Eibar in their La Liga finale on Sunday.Maxi Gómez and Iago Aspas scored two goals apiece as Celta Vigo finished the season with a 4-2 home victory against in-form Levante. Paco López’s visiting Levante side had banished any relegation concerns on the back of an impressive five-match winning sequence – including ending Barcelona’s long unbeaten run last weekend – and they took an early lead through Rubén Rochina.However, Celta, who announced on Saturday that Juan Carlos Unzué will not be continuing as coach, mounted an impressive response. Gómez struck either side of Aspas’s double to put the result beyond doubt with a little over an hour on the clock, before José Luis Morales scored a consolation for Levante 15 minutes from time.There were also plenty of goals at the Estadio Municipal de Butarque where Leganes were 3-2 winners against Real Betis, despite playing much of the match with 10 men. The Betis forward Joel Campbell opened the scoring after 20 minutes before things got worse for the hosts with a red card for Diego Rico four minutes later. But the 10 men rallied and goals from Dimitris Siovas and José Naranjo turned the game on its head. Antonio Sanabria levelled things after 76 minutes but the hosts would not be denied and Nordin Amrabat netted the winning goal shortly afterwards.Cristhian Stuani scored both of Girona’s goals as they finished the campaign with a 2-1 win at relegated Las Palmas, who had levelled through a Jonathan Calleri penalty. Loïc Rémy’s penalty gave Getafe a 1-0 win at the bottom club Málaga while Wissam Ben Yedder was on target as Sevilla won by the same scoreline at home against Alavés."

Liverpool fans whose flights to watch their side in the Champions League final in Ukraine were cancelled face bitter disappointment after the city’s mayor said he had been unable to resolve the “utter shambles” in time.More than 700 supporters face missing the game after two operators cancelled a total of three flights to Kiev because landing slots could not be allocated for them.One of them, Worldchoice Sports, initially cancelled three – though one was reinstated and left for Kiev on Friday morning. A second company, Air Partner, cancelled one flight on the eve of the match. Liverpool FC expect about 730 fans to be affected.The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, had said he was working with Kiev’s mayor, the former boxer Vitali Klitschko, and airlines to find a solution for all those who face missing out. But by Friday afternoon he said he was “gutted” that he was unable to find a solution.Anderson wrote on Twitter: “Hugely disappointed that our efforts to sort #LFC fan flights has not worked @Vitaliy-Klychko & airport directors did all possible with landing slots and planes but not able to get over the line. Frustrated by utter shambles faced by loyal fans. The company has said it can’t resolve it, we have to respect that. Gutted we got so close.”Liverpool have offered full refunds on tickets for the final to the fans whose flights were cancelled, as ticket holders called the travel problems an “absolute joke”.A statement on the club website said: “The decision to offer refunds has been made in response to the cancellation of two flights chartered by Widnes-based travel company Worldchoice Sports, leaving about 650 supporters without a flight to Kiev for the Champions League final.”A later statement added: “Liverpool FC has been made aware of the cancellation of a further charter flight to Kiev operated by Air Partner Ltd and booked through travel agents Myriad Travel and Crown Travel. “As with those affected by the cancelled or rearranged World Choice Sport flights, supporters due to travel to Kiev from Liverpool John Lennon Airport on flight number SVB116 will also be entitled to apply for a refund of their match ticket for the Champions League final.”Raj Soni, the manager of Worldchoice Sports, blamed poor organisation in Kiev for the problem. In a statement on its website, the company said: “We have exhausted all avenues to try to get landing slots. We have had them from Liverpool airport and Manchester airport, and we have applied for slots in the correct manner and timeframe with the authorities. To reiterate – this problem IS with Kiev.”Liverpool are expecting more than 20,000 supporters to travel to the Ukrainian capital for the match at Olimpiyskiy stadium.On social media, Liverpool fans expressed their disappointment and anger at the lack of information they had received. Just Spoke to @worldchoicespo customer service - 100% blaming Kiev airport. Allocated to many slots to private jets to make more money @Vitaliy_Klychko They also say @mayor_anderson is lying about the additional slots available and is spinning the PR line.0% chance of going😥So we’ve got a day to get a refund!!!! “Favourable outcome” ❌This whole situation is an absolute joke. Not @LFC fault but is that are left here just get a refund and all swept under the carpet eh? Not good enough on any level by any stakeholders apart from those let down https://t.co/Ex7BAxYjO8Jason McGimpsey, 43, a financial adviser, said he had been looking forward to the trip of a lifetime, but was told on Thursday that his flight was cancelled. “Worldchoice Sports had been stalling on giving us e-tickets and exact departure times, and it’s become clear why that was the case. Now, finally they’ve said ‘we’ve cancelled it’,” he said.“I’ve been offered a refund, but it doesn’t go anywhere near compensating me for what I’ve lost. For various personal reasons, I was unable to go to the finals in Istanbul or Athens. I go to practically all Liverpool games and I haven’t missed a home game in nearly four years.”"

Arsène Wenger takes charge of his final game against Huddersfield, fitting final opponents considering another Arsenal legend, Herbert Chapman, managed both clubs to huge success. Wenger one day should join Chapman immortalised in bronze outside the Emirates but his work is not done just yet. Arsenal have lost their past seven games away from home in the Premier League and have not picked up a point on the road in 2018. Wenger’s legacy will not be tarnished by another defeat but surely he will back himself to work some trademark magic and stroll into the sunset with three points.

Mauricio Pochettino appeared to suggest that his future at Tottenham Hotspur is linked to how the club approach the summer transfer window, as he called upon the chairman, Daniel Levy, to “be brave and take risks”.The manager has been permitted to spend £40.25m in net terms on permanent transfer deals across his four seasons at Tottenham and he has delivered a third consecutive top-three finish and Champions League qualification.From a position of strength, Pochettino sent a message to Levy that sounded suspiciously like an ultimatum: if the club want to take the next step to the biggest trophies, they have to invest more lavishly in top signings.Pochettino was asked whether he would definitely be at the club next season. He had been asked the same question last Friday and, once again, he gave an ambiguous answer.“I repeat from my last press conference – today, 100% I feel that I am here,” he said. “But the most important thing is that tomorrow all can change because it’s not in my hands.”Pochettino needed no second invitation to enter into great detail about how the club could improve. “I have very clear ideas of what we need to do,” Pochettino said. “I don’t know if the club will agree with me or not. We are going to talk next week to create the new project. It is a little bit up to Daniel and the club to agree with us.“If we want to be real contenders for big trophies, we need to review a little bit the thing. We need to create dreams that will be possible to achieve. Maybe we are a bit disappointed and frustrated because now we are close [to trophies].“I think Daniel is going to listen to me, of course. You need to be brave. Being brave is the most important thing and take risks. I think it’s a moment that the club needs to take risks and tries to work, if possible, harder than the previous season to be competitive again, because every season will be more difficult. It’s not only the big clubs. The clubs in behind us like Everton, West Ham or Leicester – they are working so hard to be close to the top six.”"

The Football Association has told its council members that selling Wembley could enable more than £1bn to be spent on community football facilities over 10 years, while having £450m from the sale still untouched in the bank.The FA chief executive, Martin Glenn, said in a speech to the council that the proposed sale of Wembley for £600m to the Fulham and Jacksonville Jaguars NFL team owner, Shahid Khan, is not selling the “soul of the game” but “an opportunity to unleash an unprecedented amount of investment into community football”.According to people present, some council members did voice opposition in principle to the FA selling the national stadium, having worked hard to pay down much of the £426m it borrowed to have Wembley rebuilt and opened in 2007.Other council members spoke in support, persuaded that a sale will release investment to improve dilapidated grassroots facilities nationwide. Others asked Glenn and the chairman, Greg Clarke, specific questions about the deal’s main essentials, including how far England and other prestige football matches will be guaranteed to take place in the stadium – the FA has said these and the stadium’s name will be protected until 2057 – how the money would be spent and whether £600m is enough money.The FA is relying on the City bank Rothschild for advice that the price represents good value; Clarke stressed to council members last week that £600m was not the first offer from Khan, who wants Wembley as a London base for his NFL franchise.Glenn explained that reaching the £1bn figure relies on the FA securing further “match” funding for facilities improvements locally, which will be difficult given severe government cuts to local authorities.From next year investment in community facilities by the FA, Premier League and government via the Football Foundation will be £70m annually.Glenn projected that only £150m of the £600m proceeds of the Wembley sale would be spent initially, with the other £450m invested, to generate £30m annual interest.Of the £150m, Glenn said £50m a year would boost annual investment from the current £70m to £120m every year for three years. With “match funding”, he forecast this £360m would increase to around £500m “accelerated investment”. In succeeding years, the £30m interest would be added to the £70m regular capital investment fund, with a further £30m expected from match funding, Glenn said.“By 2030, just over 10 years from the completion of a potential sale, we could have invested over £1bn on community football facilities – and still have a £450m capital fund untouched,” he told the council.The FA also released research on the national state of public football facilities, which found only one in three pitches is of “adequate” quality and that 75% of grassroots players surveyed are not satisfied by the availability of grass pitches. Last season, one in six matches was called off “due to poor pitch quality”.A major focus of investment is more 3G all-weather pitches. Glenn told the council the proposed investment would produce a doubling of 3G pitches, a “hub facility” for every County Football Association, “major investment” into grass pitches and other improvements.He also addressed the demand made by the EFL, which has insisted that under the FA’s financial arrangements half the proceeds should go to professional clubs for community‑focused investment. FA executives believe that can form part of the deal, Glenn referring to professional game “community trusts and foundations” having improved facilities for football projects.“Receiving an offer to sell Wembley Stadium is not a betrayal,” he said. “It is not selling the soul of the game. What we have in front of us is simply an opportunity.”The FA will continue to consult its council and board members, who include Premier League and EFL representatives, before a decision is reached."

The side who finished sixth in the Championship have not won promotion through the play-offs since Blackpool managed it in 2010. Derby County have spent the intervening years seemingly finding new and more elaborate ways not to go up but they took a step towards the top flight with a battling 1-0 win over Fulham in the first leg of their semi-final on Friday night.This was a granite solid performance from Derby, defending Cameron Jerome’s first-half header as if the very future of the club depended on it, and keeping Ryan Sessegnon and Aleksandar Mitrovic, who have laid waste to the Championship at times this season, quiet all night.“You have to do that against Fulham,” said the Derby manager, Gary Rowett, afterwards. “We were very, very disciplined.” And they were: this was the first time Fulham have failed to score in any game since January, drawing a blank here after producing a masterclass in ‘sterile domination’. Statistics do not always tell the full story but that Fulham had 74% possession and lost sums up the evening nicely.Fulham’s manager, Slavisa Jokanovic, did not seem overly concerned, though. “It’s not a bad result,” he said afterwards. “Definitely not the result we deserved. This is a very good performance from my point of view.”The game started in that usual frantic, uncoordinated mess that these play-offs tend to. Both teams tried to start on the front foot, which is a sure recipe for entertaining chaos. Fulham tried surgically to pick holes in the Derby backline but without any real joy. A couple of fairly weak efforts was the best they could manage. The Rams showed little of the same intricacy, yet their more simple approach was brilliantly rewarded in the 34th minute.Tom Huddlestone spread the ball to Craig Forsyth who, pinged over a superb cross from deep on the left, right on to the head of Jerome, who powered his effort into the net. Before the run-in Jerome had scored only once since joining Derby in January: that was his fifth in the last four games. When he signed it seemed like a curious move: now it looks inspired.The Fulham of the first half looked more like the side of the past few weeks, when they have seemed tired and tense. It is tempting to think that extraordinary run, 23 games unbeaten that nearly won them automatic promotion, had come a tiny bit too early and had sapped their energy. One could tell the travelling fans were getting nervous: at the start of the second half they started booing a ballboy.After the break their team showed more purpose: Kevin McDonald belted a shot against the bar, Floyd Ayite volleyed over from a terrific long pass by Matt Targett and Tom Cairney curled a shot just wide. Yet they struggled to create a significant chances of note.Mitrovic, so often Fulham’s brutal inspiration in the latter months of the season, struggled to find space to do much damage and began dropping deeper and deeper as he searched for the ball. Plenty of credit must go to Curtis Davies, who marshalled the big Serb superbly. “Defensively all game, we handled them really, really well,” said Rowett.Sessegnon, the boy wonder of the Championship, was also kept quiet. He was taken off with 15 minutes to go, his anonymous performance suggesting two things: that Andre Wisdom had done a fine job in neutralising him, and also that a rumoured call-up to the senior England squad is too soon for a player who does not turn 18 until next week.On the touchline, as Fulham attack after Fulham attack was snuffed out, Jokanovic, in that brooding manner of his, cast his eyes towards the ground like a parent who was not angry, just disappointed. If this often thrilling side do not go up this season, it will be a shame but in truth they deserved no more from a game where they did not make enough of their theoretical domination. They will need to be more clinical in the return on Monday.The result leaves the second leg placed beautifully. “We can’t go down there and try to protect the lead. We’ve got to try to win the game,” Rowett said, expressing the requisite degree of caution. “It gives us a slender lead but, as we know, that can be cancelled out in a second. I didn’t let them have the music on in the dressing room because we’ve got to be focused for the next game.”"

The deafening sound as Fulham celebrated promotion under the Wembley arch gave a whole new meaning to white noise, for Slavisa Jokanovic’s slow-burning, swaggering side had finally got over the line. A couple of months ago, Jokanovic had insisted that dreams were to be had in the bedroom but he woke with his team triumphant and many topless at the end of Fulham’s first game at the national stadium since 1975. His players, showered in gold confetti, guzzled champagne as they bounced on a hastily erected stage still feeling the effects of the mass pile-on at full-time.The often ice-cool Jokanovic erupted with joy, thumped the air with both fists, later hoisting the trophy airborne while Shahid Khan, the Fulham owner intent on buying Wembley for £900m, puffed his cheeks. Victory was theirs, Wembley possibly his. Khan, who is worth around £7bn, moved from Pakistan to the United States with $500 in his pocket and here Fulham exited with a jackpot that could be worth £280m if they stay up next season.For now, as Jokanovic said when asked about the future of Ryan Sessegnon and retaining on-loan striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, it is all about enjoying what his attacking team have achieved. This fearless, rip-roaring Fulham team, along with the champions Wolverhampton Wanderers, will reinvigorate a Premier League that has grown a little tired and musty. Promotion is vindication for the glorious front-foot manner in which Fulham have flummoxed countless teams this season. They will do the same next season but they are not naive. “We must try to dominate against teams we think we can but we must be realistic in the future,” Jokanovic said.The risk, as typified by Denis Odoi’s wild kick on Jack Grealish to pick up his second yellow card, is that they can sometimes overindulge but they are mightily good fun. Tom Cairney, the twinkling Fulham captain, just about held back the tears in interviews pitch-side. “After we missed out on promotion last season, a lot of people wrote us off,” he said. “We got a lot of stick. But football won today. Football won.”Cairney harnessed his role not only as the team’s protagonist but its artist too – probing, prowling, twirling away from challenges, stroking passes across the canvas and, ultimately, adding that all-important finishing touch. Before Cairney slotted home, time appeared to stand still as he readied himself to meet Sessegnon’s cute, weighted ball. For a team that froze on the final day of the regular Championship season, in turn forcing them into the play-offs, they displayed enormous steel, fight, and plenty of personality here.Much of the talk in the buildup to this match had revolved around Villa’s big-game experience yet Fulham showed they have anything but a soft underbelly. They were perfectly capable of time-wasting and utilising other dark arts, just like the rest of them. Mitrovic, one of three key January signings, put in another classy performance too, summed up by a sublime touch to control Tim Ream’s pass. How other clubs must wish they had pushed the boat out as Fulham, then languishing in mid-table, did to land Mitrovic from Newcastle United, as well as Matt Targett from Southampton.Any worry that Fulham would buckle at the thought of the occasion or wilt under pressure evaporated. “We must adapt ourselves and know what is ahead; we must know it is the Premier League, the best and most competitive league,” Jokanovic said. “We must adapt and be clever, we must not make one step back. To show ambition we are going to need to show the money too.”Sessegnon, who turned 18 this month, has been rightly lavished with praise all season. Yet on the opposite flank, Ryan Fredericks was again mightily impressive, with both occasionally helping out the other to double up on Albert Adomah and Robert Snodgrass. Between them, they gladly hoovered up danger and it was only Grealish, the dancing Villa playmaker who Fulham failed to mute. His bewitching second-half surge upfield did deserve to finish with the ball rippling the net.Other than that, Villa asked few questions, by which point Fulham had answered all those thrown at them. The exciting thing is the project Jokanovic referenced in his post-match comments is just beginning for this Fulham side."

It was only a matter of time before a move away from the harsh glare of the spotlight was mooted for poor old Loris Karius. He’s been offered a season-long loan deal by newly promoted Serie C side Rimini. Their president has dressed it up as a present for the Liverpool keeper’s upcoming 25th birthday, and a chance for the jittery soul to “rediscover his serenity and self-esteem” in the arms of “a large family”. And to think just four days ago Karius was dreaming of becoming a European champion.Liverpool meanwhile are wondering whether to spend the best part of £80m on Roma stopper Alisson. At some point during the post-Reina era, they’re going to have to bite the bullet.Manchester United are in for Karius and Liverpool’s nemesis Gareth Bale. He’ll cost £122m, an eye-watering sum even for United, so they’ll try to recoup some cash by offloading Anthony Martial. Bidding will start at £100m. Anyone?No, nobody today.Maurizio Sarri is already making plans for his reign at Chelsea, even though the gig doesn’t even exist yet, what with Antonio Conte still in office. The former Napoli boss would make Inter striker Mauro Icardi his first signing. Jordi Alba might become his second, though he’ll have to battle Manchester United for the Barcelona left-back.Or will it be Laurent Blanc making these purchases? The former Bordeaux, France and PSG boss has been sounded out by Roman Abramovich as a cheaper option, his being a free agent and all.Manchester City are still interested in Riyad Mahrez, and reckon £60m will be enough to satisfy Leicester now, even in this Bale-distorted market.The new West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini has already figured his defence is a load of old toot, and will accordingly fix it by bringing in Armando Izzo of Genoa and Marlon Santos of Barcelona.And Tottenham have their eye on Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy. Where this leaves Hugo Lloris is anyone’s guess, but something tells us this could be a fairly active window for keepers, so opportunities won’t be too hard to come by should the worst happen."

Antonio Conte began the afternoon in highly animated mode and, for a while, turned almost hysterically agitated in his technical area before his body language finally morphed into sulky acceptance.As the clock ticked down Chelsea’s manager became increasingly static as he stood arms folded, expression disconsolate, on the touchline. Maybe his players were saving themselves for the FA Cup final but they never looked remotely like a side who kicked off harbouring outside hopes of a top‑four place.Ultimately Liverpool’s demolition of Brighton ensured Chelsea were destined to finish fifth but a performance when they were dominated by Newcastle’s outstanding Jonjo Shelvey, Mo Diamé and Ayoze Pérez was hardly what their manager will have wanted on what is expected to be his final Premier League match in charge of London’s most politicised club.Conte said later that he was the “last person” to answer questions about Chelsea’s future. He did, though, take his players to task for their attitude and application here and warned them to up their game for the meeting with Manchester United at Wembley.“We now have six days to change our desire, our will to fight because, if we play a game like this in the FA Cup final we do not have a chance,” he said. “There was big frustration for me because I wanted to finish the season in the best possible way. Newcastle showed great desire and fight and outplayed us but we didn’t play a good game.”When asked whether the Cup final would represent his last game in charge of Chelsea he started laughing. “Do you think so, you have the news?” a smiling Conte inquired of his questioner before offering a riddle of a reply. “The club know very well the situation,” he said. “After Saturday we go on vacation, so we will see next season.”Rafael Benítez and Newcastle are also no strangers to playing politics and the manager’s future here is far from certain. But Benítez, as he continues contract negotiations with Mike Ashley, cannot have failed to be swayed by the choruses of “We want you to stay,” that echoed evocatively to the St James’ Park rafters.“It was pretty much the perfect Sunday for me,” said the Spaniard, who will not extend a contract entering its final year unless he receives assurances as to transfer budget and infrastructure. With suitors circling things are at a delicate stage.“We’ve finished 10th,” Benítez said. “But 10th is not high enough for this club. The potential to do much better is there. We have to be sure we share the same ambitions. We need a squad capable of going anywhere and winning.”Ashley later said Benítez had his “full support” and added: “I will continue to ensure that every penny generated by the club is available to him. I hope very much that Rafa will remain at Newcastle United.”For protracted periods Newcastle looked as if they were the side pursuing Champions League qualification, piling so much pressure on their visitors that Chelsea frequently struggled to escape their own half.With the intensity of the home side ferocious and the decibel level ear-splitting, Conte’s team were in near total disarray with the lesser spotted Ross Barkley, making a rare start, struggling to get anywhere near the ball in midfield. Part of that was down to the fact that Shelvey, like Diamé, was irrepressible. Thibaut Courtois was swiftly required to repel Shelvey’s vicious long-range half-volley and Diamé’s angled shot.As Shelvey revelled in making N’Golo Kanté look thoroughly ordinary he appeared every inch an England international. The consensus is that Gareth Southgate has opted against including him in the World Cup squad he is due to name on Wednesday but Shelvey has not entirely abandoned hope of a summons. Maybe, just maybe, England’s manager still has a big decision to make.Newcastle’s playmaker helped create all three goals. The first originated with a pass that picked out the impressive Matt Ritchie, who confounded Conte’s defence with a left-foot cross from the right. When Jacob Murphy attempted somewhat audaciously to lob Courtois the goalkeeper palmed the ball clear – but only as far as Dwight Gayle, who headed into the unguarded net.As Conte appeared in danger of physical implosion Benítez remained an oasis of serenity, celebrating the goal by giving his glasses a polish before summoning his captain, Jamaal Lascelles, for a detailed tactical discussion.With only near misses from Shelvey and Pérez and another fine Courtois save to deny Gayle ensuring the scoreline remained 1-0, that homily seemed to have the desired effect.Although Eden Hazard belatedly began imposing a little of his talent on the second half, it was simply not Chelsea’s day. Despite a backpedalling Martin Dubravka performing acrobatic wonders to claw Olivier Giroud’s accomplished backheel to safety following Hazard’s cross, Newcastle responded by scoring a second.Again it was created by Shelvey, whose volleyed connection with a half-cleared cross would probably have flown past Courtois had Pérez not flicked out a boot to apply the final touch.After Dubravka excelled in keeping a Barkley effort out with his legs, Pérez soon scored his second. This time Shelvey whipped a free-kick in and Florian Lejeune’s slide-rule pass prefaced the Spaniard dispatching a shot past Courtois from six yards.As the manager who led Chelsea to Europa League glory Benítez never felt an iota of love at Stamford Bridge. He is smothered in the stuff on Tyneside but is determined not to let his head rule his heart. “We’ll see how the conversations [with the board] develop,” he said. “We’re still talking, maybe even tonight, so we’ll see what happens.”"

Arsène Wenger’s powers may have dwindled in recent years but at least his last match at Arsenal ended in the same way as his first one in 1996, his team taking three points. Pierre‑Emerick Aubameyang, the Frenchman’s last major signing at the club, made sure of that detail by stabbing into the net in the 38th minute.The result may have been incidental to both teams but this was no non-event. It was most definitely a happening, a festival within a football fixture.Nearly 22 years ago Wenger arrived at Arsenal as a French revolutionary and here he sent out his troops for the final time before his status at the club changed to head off an ancien régime. Given the dietary advances that Wenger introduced to English football, there was an amusing irony to the fact that Arsenal were being hosted by a team whose preparations had involved going on the lash in London.Huddersfield fought hard all season for their right to party after Wednesday’s draw at Chelsea, the result that confirmed they will be in the Premier League next season. That is a resounding success for the Yorkshire club in view of how far they have travelled in a short time. So everyone, home and away fans alike, was in the mood to celebrate here. And everyone, home and away fans alike, stood to cheer and applaud Wenger as he walked across the pitch before kick-off to salute the travelling fans one last time. The atmosphere was mainly joyful but there was a touch of poignancy at that moment and, with the sun glowing and the sky nearly cloudless, no one could claim water in their eyes was rain. It was not even crocodile tears, mostly.“It was spontaneous,” the manager said of his pre-match greeting. “They had disagreements with me that I can accept but we had one thing in common: we loved Arsenal football club and I just wanted to share that with them.”The noise from the crowd never abated, the entire match subsequently played out to a soundtrack of singing and clapping. David Wagner, the 14th full-time manager Huddersfield have employed since the beginning of Wenger’s reign, has awoken hopes of a glorious new era at the Yorkshire club, who have thrice in their history been English champions. That is the same number of league titles Wenger delivered to Arsenal so, when Huddersfield players gave him a guard of honour before this match, they did so as representatives of a club who know the value of his achievements.The reason Wenger has been ushered towards stepping down, of course, is that those feats started to seem almost as distant as Huddersfield’s titles. His team pitched up here on the back of a dismal sequence of away performances. Could they rouse themselves to give their departing manager his first away league point of 2018?It seemed not at first. Huddersfield, liberated from the threat of relegation, played with adventure and forced Arsenal back early on. They almost scored in the second minute when Florent Hadergjonaj crossed from the right and Steve Mounié leapt high to send a downward header towards goal. David Ospina needed two tries to hold it.Mounié was given a better chance in the 11th minute, this time Alex Pritchard supplying the pass, but the striker slashed over the bar from eight yards. It took Arsenal half an hour to come to grips with the pace Huddersfield had set. Once they did so, they began to take over.Their goal unfolded like a tribute to Wenger, Aubameyang scoring after the sort of cutting one-touch move that the manager has always espoused. Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Alexandre Lacazette combined slickly to feed Aaron Ramsey, who passed across the face of goal for Aubameyang to convert.That was his 10th in 13 matches since joining halfway through a season of upheaval. Signed by a manager on the way out, the Gabonese striker is central to Arsenal’s future.The hosts scavenged for chances on the break. They nearly found what they sought on the hour but Ospina dived low to the left to tip away a fierce shot from the edge of the area by Tom Ince.As the intensity drained from the game Lacazette was presented with an opportunity to make matters even more comfortable for his team in the 79th minute. But Jonas Lössl read his mind and blocked his attempted dink. Two minutes later Arsenal missed another one-on-one chance, Lössl thwarting Danny Welbeck. Then came another farewell, as Dean Whitehead was given one last appearance before he retires and joins Huddersfield’s coaching staff. He could have claimed his entry inspired an equaliser if Aaron Mooy’s shot from 12 yards had found the net rather than crossbar. But Wenger was not denied one more win for the road."

Pre-season prediction 1st; Current position: 1stA season beyond compare. We’ve broken almost every record there is to break, we’re still on for 100 points and have done so playing the most outrageous football. The Champions League exit to Liverpool was a disappointment, as was losing to United, but I’m loth to criticise Pep. He has masterminded arguably the most dominant season since the Premier League began, and my most enjoyable season as a City fan. For that, I cannot thank him enough. 10/10Stars/flops Kevin De Bruyne cemented his status as one of the world’s best players, but David Silva and Sterling haven’t been far off his level. Silva’s had another ridiculously consistent season, which is all the more impressive when you consider the personal problems he’s suffered, while Sterling took his game up yet another level under Pep, and was at the heart of so many of our key moments. Ederson and Kyle Walker were also amazing. Flops? Not a single one.Summer targets A holding midfielder as an heir to Fernandinho. The Brazilian has been peerless, but we need to start thinking about a succession plan. Another forward is also a must as we only have four (admittedly excellent) options for three forward positions.Best and worst away fans Bristol City were excellent. Stoke were not.Moment that made you smile Fabian Delph winning the Premier League. No one could have predicted that he’d play such a crucial role, but he’s been brilliant. He fully deserves his medal.– Lloyd Scragg ninetythreetwenty.com; @lloyd_scraggPre-season prediction 2nd; Current position: 2ndWe’ve improved on recent seasons, we’re back in the Champions League – but there’ve been times when you’d think the team had never played together before. There’s an infuriating consistency about this side: beating top teams, then being spineless against Brighton and West Brom. We need an overhaul, and someone with leadership qualities. 7/10Stars/flops David De Gea has been our best as usual, and Romelu Lukaku was solid, even if he seemed like a passenger in some of the big games. Paul Pogba, though, has been frustrating. It’s time he put his effort into improving his game rather than his dance routines and haircuts. It’s also worth questioning José Mourinho’s ability to nurture talent: nearly all the young players, bar Jesse Lingard and Scott McTominay, have regressed.Summer targets We need two full-backs and a creative playmaker like Christian Eriksen or Eden Hazard. I expect we’ll end up with a 30-year-old ex-José player.Best and worst away fans Palace were thrashed but continued to sing. The worst were Arsenal. They spent all season shouting “Wenger Out”, and when he decides to leave he becomes this legendary manager again.Moment that made you smile The 3-2 comeback against City. After all the Olé, Olé, Olé noise in the first half, the only sounds out of them in the second half were cries of disbelief and despair.– Shaun O’Donnell Observer readerPre-season prediction 10th; Current position: 10thIt’s been tough, but Rafa Benítez sculpted a spirited, organised unit from a team largely built for the Championship. Survival was the aim and we achieved it, pleasingly without a month or two of squeaky-bum time. Our manager deserves a lot of credit, as do our players, who seem to genuinely care about the club. 7/10Stars/flops Jamaal Lascelles and Florian Lejeune formed a strong partnership, while Jonjo Shelvey proved he’s one of the best passers in the division. Mo Diamé showed an astonishing improvement in the second half of the season, as did Aleksandar Mitrovic, albeit for Fulham, while Martin Dubravka was an upgrade on our other goalkeepers. We saw little of Islam Slimani, though, and sadly Dwight Gayle doesn’t seem to have the scoring touch at this level. Jacob Murphy has also had little impact – a shame for the boyhood Newcastle fan.Summer targets First priority should be to keep Rafa. Second? We need at least two Premier League class goalscorers who could reach double figures. Whether we can afford them (or are willing to part with the cash) depends on whether Mike Ashley still owns the club in August.Best and worst away fans West Brom were noisy and loyal, a real credit. Man United were arrogant and entitled.Moment that made you smile Sunderland getting out of the Championship at the first attempt. They told us to “enjoy Burton” when we went down in 2016 – now they’ll be enjoying the Brewers in League One.– David and Richard Holmes Observer readersPre-season prediction 8th; Current position: 17thIt’s been a mostly dreadful season coupled with a surprising (yet still largely uninspiring) Cup run and then a late recovery to more-or-less seal survival with a few days left. It was self-inflicted misery: Pellegrino’s credentials never stacked up and we took far too long to rectify the mistake. Most of this squad shouldn’t have been anywhere near the bottom three and yet here we are celebrating survival as though it’s the mid-90s all over again. So it’s 1/10 for Pellegrino’s spell and 7/10 for Hughes. Let’s call it 3/10 overall.Stars/flops Alex McCarthy was solid, and Charlie Austin had a good run in the autumn. There are far too many flops to list, but Guido Carrillo stands out. NINETEEN MILLION POUNDS for 625 minutes of football where he didn’t look remotely like scoring. Oh, and Sofiane Boufal: all the talent in the world but the attitude of a spoilt child.Summer targets A leader. Someone who will organise the defence. The four centre-back options we have at the moment all have some of the required qualities, but each seem to require an experienced head directing the traffic. The sales of José Fonte and Virgil van Dijk left us woefully short. More pace in attack wouldn’t go amiss either.Best and worst away fans Leicester brought good numbers for a midweek game, and certainly enjoyed Claude Puel being their manager at that point. Chelsea were unusually quiet.Moment that made you smile Ronald Koeman’s sacking at Everton, having splurged the GDP of a small country on an entire team of slow No 10s.– Steve Grant SaintsWeb.co.uk; @SteveGrant1983Pre-season prediction 13th; Current position: 20thIt’s been truly awful. Mark Hughes was rightly shown the door in January but the farcical effort to replace him set the tone for the rest of the season. Paul Lambert said the right things, added discipline, but, somehow, the results actually got worse … zero wins in the last 13. He has to go. We have to start again. 0/10Stars/flops January recruits Moritz Bauer and Badou Ndiaye gave everyone a little bit of hope that Stoke’s transfer department aren’t totally incompetent. But they were the only positives. Joint-record signing Kevin Wimmer (£18m!) looks League Two-ready; Saido Berahino let everyone down on and off the pitch; Jesé had personal problems but also showed an awful attitude; and then there’s Charlie Adam, his missed penalty and his red card in the run-in. I’d go on, but there isn’t space.Summer targets A keeper, a centre-half, two new central midfielders, a pacy winger and two scorers. Crikey!Best and worst away fans Swansea were quiet. The best were Palace for their sportsmanship as we went down, and for the throwback to the 1990s with balloons pre-match.Moment that made you smile Taking the lead at West Ham last month. The passion on our players’ faces in that moment gave us all heart. But then West Ham equalised. Too little, too late.– Rob Holloway Observer readerPre-season prediction 14th; Current position: 18thIt’s been a disaster. Just like Francesco Guidolin the season before, Paul Clement was let down by a very poor transfer window and was gone by Christmas. Carlos Carvalhal came in and initially got us performing and winning again, but the form suddenly dropped, with negative tactics flushing away the hope he’d restored. Our eight-game winless run was terminal: throwing away a four-point gap from the bottom three to all-but confirm relegation with a game to spare. 2/10Stars/flops Lukasz Fabianski is a superb, vastly underrated goalkeeper: he deserves better than this. Standing out among the flops were Renato Sanches and Roque Mesa. They were supposed to be our big signings who were going to make the difference in midfield. Mesa was back in Spain on loan inside six months; Sanches barely played again after injury.Summer targets Where to start? An overhaul has been long overdue. What form it takes depends on what happens with some of our loan players, but the whole side needs work. Our two best defenders and goalkeeper will surely leave, we have no creativity, and we need a striker or two. So, plenty of work to do…Best and worst away fans The worst were Everton: silent apart from Sam Allardyce chants. The best? Crystal Palace fans never let their team down.Moment that made you smile The 3-1 home win against Arsenal in January, days after a 1-0 home win against Liverpool. It felt like a turning point – but we won only twice again after that.– Kevin Elphick Swansea.VitalFootball.co.ukPre-season prediction: Top three; Current position: 3rdA mixed bag. Europe and the FA Cup had so much potential, but we crashed out in a frustrating way. The league was always going to be difficult with us not playing at White Hart Lane, but we surprisingly found our feet and put in some fine performances. Champions League football again is a great achievement. But the pressure is mounting on “the project” that Pochettino is building, and rightly so. We need to start producing the goods, or all this hard work will be in vain. 7/10Stars/flops Davinson Sánchez has had a magnificent start to his Spurs career: long may it continue. Christian Eriksen, Mousa Dembélé and Jan Vertonghen also had great seasons, contributing when it matters. And Lucas Moura looked extremely positive when he played – I’m looking forward to seeing more of him next season. Flops? Sissoko. Don’t really need to elaborate on that one, do I? Serge Aurier and Hugo Lloris also earned some criticism.Summer targets It looks like Alderweireld, Rose and potentially Dembélé are going this summer, which I’m sad about. They will be very hard to replace. United’s Martial is still the one player I would love to have at the Lane.Best and worst away fans Burnley were best. I also saw a video of them singing and dancing at the Library (the Emirates) during their 5-0 defeat. Lovely. Not so lovely – the worst fans – were Woolwich Arsenal, obviously.Moment that made you smile Pardew getting the sack. It never fails to amuse.– Jonny Holmes Observer readerPre-season prediction 14th; Current position: 13thWe started the season like a train and finished it like, well, a train that had run out of oomph and was trundling along until it hit something. A crude assessment might lead you to wonder why we ever got rid of that nice Marco Silva; in fact, the wheels had long since come off when he left and few Watford fans mourned his departure. Injuries didn’t help but Silva displayed no flexibility when things started to go wrong, and fluttering his eyelashes at Everton (Everton!) nine games in was never going to curry favour. The jury is still out on the likable Javi Gracia. 6/10Stars/flops Abdoulaye Doucouré was the driving force, his form dwindling to merely acceptable levels as the season fizzled out. If he gets the big move he seems to have been angling for, the biggest regret is that Nathaniel Chalobah’s knee injury deprived us of a truly formidable midfield partnership. Adrian Mariappa was also a star, but Richarlison seemed to down tools after a magnificent couple of months.Summer targets We need a striker and probably a left back. The goalkeeping situation also needs resolving, Heurelho Gomes having been ousted mid-season, and Doucouré will need replacing if he leaves.Best and worst away fans Huddersfield made an absolute racket in both games, although we let them away with six points which may have helped. Palace made a lot of noise, too, but lose points through being Palace.Moment that made you smile What’s not to like about stuffing Chelsea, however calamitous their defending? And the whole Wimbledon/MK Franchise thing, obviously …– Matt Rowson BHappy.wordpress.com; @mattrowsonPre-season prediction 17th; Current position: 19thIt was a story of three managers. First up, Tony Pulis, who arrived as a sticking plaster in 2015, saved us, then steadily bored fans and players to death. The decisions to extend his contract last summer, then to keep him for so long, were the season’s first big mistakes. That was then compounded by hiring Alan Pardew, whose only plan was to tell the players to throw off the Pulis shackles and express themselves. They stuck by him far too long as well. Then, finally, came Darren Moore, who almost pulled off a real miracle, and is now properly revered by fans. Could he be our Special One? As for marks, Pulis and Pardew can share 0/10, Darren gets a 10.Stars/flops It’s hard to be positive about any of them, but Ben Foster, Chris Brunt, Craig Dawson, Ahmed Hegazi and James McClean tried, at least. There’s not enough space to cover the flops. The decision-makers and managers take a lot of the blame, but too many players downed tools.Summer targets So hard to say, as so many players will look to leave. But the club is still financially strong, so a rebuild job is not beyond us. We’ll probably need a left-back, two centre-halves, a right-back, and so on …Best and worst away fans Huddersfield were loud and proud. Arsenal were quiet, once again.Moment that made you smile It has to be AFC Wimbledon waving goodbye to MK Dons.– Richard Jefferson WBAUnofficial.org.uk/forum; @richbaggiePre-season prediction 8th; Current position: 15thIt’s been a trial. I tipped us for eighth because, on paper, the signings looked good. Should have known better. We’ve had Africa-gate, an injury crisis, fans at war with each other, a defence that’s as strong and stable as Theresa May, pitch invasions and a besieged boardroom. Poor old Slaven Bilic appeared exhausted by the end. At least David Moyes did the job he was hired for and kept us up. He got the side fitter, instilled some discipline and transformed Marko Arnautovic. There are reservations about his defensive style and glacial use of subs, but we need some continuity. He deserves another go. 4/10Stars/flops Arnautovic went from diffident winger to cult figure, and showed a pleasing ability to wind up Mark Hughes. Young Declan Rice did well, and Mark Noble never hid. Joe Hart, though, continued to mix great saves with catastrophes; Cheikhou Kouyaté was indifferent; and Michail Antonio now appears an injury waiting to happen.Summer targets First we need David Sullivan to stop dealing with transfers. Then we need a new defensive midfielder, another centre-back, a new right-back to replace the ageing Pablo Zabaleta, a winger and a striker.Best and worst away fans Stoke fans proved they could do it on a cold Monday night in Stratford. Worst were Liverpool for erroneously suggesting that we were going down with Everton.Moment that made you smile Came earlier this month, when a Leicester fan invaded the pitch to be greeted with: “Are you West Ham in disguise?”– Pete May Author of Goodbye to Boleyn; HammersInTheHeart.blogspot.co.uk• Part 1: Arsenal to Liverpool"

David Moyes remains unlikely to continue as West Ham’s manager despite finishing the season with a 3-1 victory over Everton at the London Stadium, with sources rating the Scot’s chances of being given a new contract at no more than 25%.West Ham expect to reach a final decision at a board meeting next week and although Moyes has kept them in the Premier League, the east London club will consider a host of candidates in the coming days. If they prove attractive enough to one of their favoured picks, then Moyes is likely to be looking for a new job.The same could be true of Sam Allardyce, who did not sound optimistic about seeing out the final year of his contract with Everton. “I can’t quite say I’m confident after all the rumours I’m reading because there is no smoke without fire, is there?” Allardyce said. “But we will wait and see when we meet up this week.”Moyes was more positive. West Ham were in the bottom three when the 55-year-old replaced Slaven Bilic on a six-month deal in November and he is thought to be in line for a £1.65m bonus after leading them to 13th place. But while he has found a way to survive in awkward circumstances, he might not have impressed sufficiently to convince David Sullivan and David Gold, the owners, to reward him with a long-term deal.West Ham are interested in Rafael Benítez, who might prove too expensive to prise away from Newcastle, and they have held informal talks with Manuel Pellegrini, although the former Manchester City manager has also been heavily linked with Sevilla. Other options include Burnley’s Sean Dyche, Huddersfield’s David Wagner and Marco Silva, the former Hull and Watford manager. Their preference is to hire a manager who has worked in the Premier League, although they have not denied making contact with Shakhtar Donetsk’s Paulo Fonseca last week.They have also not completely ruled out appointing Moyes, who has misgivings of his own about taking the job. The former Everton manager hit out at the club’s culture of leaks after word of his row with Andy Carroll filtered through to the media earlier this month and he has challenged West Ham to show that they can match his ambition.“We will meet next week,” Moyes said. “We’ve not arranged a date, not arranged a time. I don’t know if anybody can make that big of a difference in six months. Even Pep [Guardiola] took a bit of time to get this right. I don’t think anybody can really come and make a difference. You would need to give a bit longer. Everybody always thinks the grass is greener and there is something better out there. I would say, more often than not, it’s proved wrong.”Moyes believes that he will receive offers from elsewhere if his time is up. “I’ll have options,” he said. “Look, it’s not us challenging each other. I’ve had a really good relationship with the board, I speak regularly with them. I would like to change things and maybe everybody is not happy with change.”There is a feeling within West Ham’s squad that Moyes’s methods are old-fashioned but he provided a strong audition here. The hosts swept forward and took the lead in the 38th minute. Cheikhou Kouyaté’s pass ran beyond Marko Arnautovic but Michael Keane had pushed up, leaving a huge gap in the middle of Everton’s defence. Manuel Lanzini scampered on to the ball and used his left foot to beat Jordan Pickford with a precise shot from 18 yards.Everton were bland for long spells and finishing eighth is unlikely to convince them to keep Allardyce, who hit out at suggestions that he has a troubled relationship with Wayne Rooney. “We’ve been very professional and very adult with our conversations,” he said. “You’ve been misled by somebody, or you have just decided to make it up.”Rooney, who has an offer to join DC United, was absent with a knee injury and Everton toiled without him. West Ham doubled their lead midway through the second half when Arnautovic rolled away from Keane and caught out Pickford with a thunderous shot from long range. The Austrian has scored 11 times in the league under Moyes.The visitors pulled a goal back when Oumar Niasse bundled the ball home from a corner with 16 minutes left, but West Ham sealed their first home win over Everton since 2007 when Pickford failed to get a strong enough hand to Lanzini’s curling shot.Moyes ended with a light touch, joking that he can relax now that he is out of contract. “I’ll take my suit off at midnight, undo my tie a little bit, be back on the streets come midnight,” he said."

As Carlos Carvalhal prepares to clear his desk – the fourth manager to do so at the Liberty Stadium in the space of 19 chaotic months – thoughts turn to identifying his successor and the need to radically overhaul a squad destined for the Championship long before relegation is confirmed on Sunday. The key question is whether Swansea City’s owners can trust their chairman, Huw Jenkins, with either of those tasks.Jenkins wore a halo during the club’s rise through the leagues, earning plenty of praise for Swansea’s rags-to-riches fairytale. Yet he has badly lost his touch over the last three seasons, making one flawed decision after another and, increasingly, has come across as a man who has forgotten what his club’s philosophy – the Swansea Way – is supposed to represent.The thinking has become so muddled that Jenkins praised Carvalhal and his players for showing “tremendous patience and character to stick to our gameplan” after a 1-1 draw against West Bromwich Albion last month. Swansea were abysmal that afternoon. They scored with a header from a corner and failed to register a shot on target during 90 minutes of banal and clueless football. It was a “gameplan” that would have made Roberto Martínez and Brendan Rodgers, two pioneers of that Swansea Way, weep.Rodgers, it is worth remembering, could have been back at Swansea in the summer of 2016 but Jenkins, in a decision met with bemusement throughout the club, gave the job to Francesco Guidolin. It was a grave error of judgment – Jenkins has described it as his biggest regret – and sent Swansea into a tailspin from which they never recovered as they lurched from crisis to crisis, sacking Guidolin, before turning to Bob Bradley, Paul Clement and then Carvalhal, all of whom came in to extinguish fires rather than play tiki‑taka football.The recruitment strategy, which Jenkins oversees and managers dip in and out of, has been just as shambolic. In a critical game at Bournemouth on Saturday it said everything that not one of Swansea’s five summer signings (more than £40m in transfer and loan fees) was on the pitch. On top of that, Borja Bastón, the £15m then club-record signing from the previous summer, was on loan in Spain along with Roque Mesa, who cost £12m. Ask Jenkins about Bastón or any of the questionable signings and he will go on the defensive, which is part of the problem.Even the one new face that had fans jumping and down last summer with excitement turned out to be an unmitigated disaster. Renato Sanches, whose loan from Bayern Munich set Swansea back £8.5m including wages, will be remembered in south Wales for that pass to a Carabao advertisement hoarding at Stamford Bridge and a tweet about his new emoji on the day the club were all but relegated. Looking about as comfortable in a Swansea shirt as a Cardiff City supporter, Sanchez wore the expression of a man who thought he should be playing alongside Toni Kroos, not Tom Carroll.So much of what happens at Swansea makes little sense. From handing out lucrative four-year deals to squad members such as Nathan Dyer, who was on his way out of the club when sent on loan to Leicester the previous summer, to allowing players with a value to run down their contracts, the decision‑making is unfathomable at times.Who, for example, thought that Swansea could get away with playing Kyle Naughton at right-back without any pressure on his position? Would Wayne Routledge get near any other Premier League squad? Why should anyone have been surprised that Wilfried Bony spent the majority of the season injured when he had not completed 90 minutes at club level for more than a year? And, perhaps more than anything, where on earth did Swansea think the goals were going to come from when that transfer window closed last September? The 27 they have scored in 37 Premier League games is the lowest in the division and, quite frankly, an embarrassment.Jenkins, in fairness, is far from the only man with his fingerprints on this mess. Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, Swansea’s majority shareholders, approve what goes on and must take a sizeable share of the blame for what has been a dreadful two years under their watch. The Americans are absentee owners and, if they have learned anything from the past two seasons, it must surely be that running a football club from the other side of the Atlantic will only be successful if the day-to-day control is in expert hands. In other words, they need to show leadership, freshen things up and bring in a sporting or technical director to take charge of the football side.There is also the not‑so‑small matter of finding a young, ambitious and attack-minded coach to put some pride back into a club that has lost its soul and identity, not just its Premier League status, and a new team to assemble. One hand is enough to count the players worth keeping once Alfie Mawson and Lukasz Fabianski have departed. Swansea, in short, are starting all over again and maybe, after three miserable years when no lessons were learned, that is no bad thing."

This article is part of the Guardian’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.Juan Antonio Pizzi took his place in the Saudi Arabia dugout for the first time in November 2017 yet he is still waiting for his his first competitive game in charge of the Green Falcons - that comes against Russia in the World Cup’s opening match. During his seven-month tenure the Argentinian has packed in as many friendlies as possible to gauge where the side are and what needs to be done before the eyes of the world will be on them on 14 June.During qualification under Bert van Marwijk, the Green Falcons usually played in a 4-3-3, happy to sit back against the better teams, look to hit on the break and get the ball forward quickly. Pizzi has been trying to get the players to play the ball out from the back more. It has worked to a certain extent and there has been a certain tidiness about the team in recent, if low-key, friendly victories over Algeria and Greece, which represented a clear improvement on a 4-0 loss to Belgium in March. The team have been keeping the ball better and moving it quickly. They are also adept at slowing down games, disrupting opponents’ rhythm and being generally frustrating.Pizzi, a former Chile manager, looks likely to play a compact 4-2-3-1, with the attacking three midfielders ready to drop deep to ensure that there are plenty of bodies in midfield.With goals potentially hard to come by, the Green Falcons will focus on being solid. There is experience at the back, though that comes with susceptibility to pace and a lack of exposure to top-class attackers. Osama Hawsawi is the leader in defence, strong and physical, but, at 34, he is slowing down. The good news is that Omar Hawsawi (no relation) next to him has been in excellent form this season. Full-back Yasser al-Shahrani is able to play on either side, allowing Pizzi to pick more midfield options, and can get forward quickly.The experienced Taisir al-Jassim will sit alongside the underrated Abdullah Otayf in midfield. Both use the ball well, though the latter may not be able to get forward as much as he would like.The attacking three players are the true standouts. Salem al-Dawsari, Yahya al-Shehri and Fahad al-Muwallad are the team’s creative heartbeat with the ability to unlock Asian defences, though their greatest tests remain. The trio spent the second half of the season on loan to La Liga clubs, recording only two appearances between them.How sharp they are in Russia could determine how the team perform. The two wide players are capable of getting behind defences and, if Shehri can find space behind the main striker, the Green Falcons could cause problems.The lack of a regular goalscorer is an issue. Mohammad al-Sahlawi is likely to play up front but there are other options, such as Muhannad Assiri, who is an aerial threat and can hold up the ball better.Probable starting XIWhich player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup?Fahad al-Muwallad is an exciting talent and the kind of player fans love to watch, provided he receives the ball in the right areas. If he is given a little freedom by the coach then he has the potential to make things happen and put fans on the edge of their seats.Which player is likely to disappoint?Mohammad al-Sahlawi has an excellent scoring record for his country, averaging well over a goal every other game. There are doubts, however, over whether the striker has the quality to score against top defences.What is the realistic aim for Saudi Arabia at the World Cup and why?This is the side’s first showpiece in 12 years and although most people know it won’t be easy there is some hope, thanks to being placed in one of the easier groups (with Russia, Egypt and Uruguay), that they may sneak a place in the second round. Failing that, not finishing last would be welcomed.Greg Wilcox is the sports editor of Arab News.Follow him on Twitter here. Click here for a profile of Saudi Arabia’s Salem al-Sahlawi."

football,"With English players prominent in the Premier League and Liverpool storming to the Champions League final, Gareth Southgate is cheerful about England’s future prospects

Sometimes managers pepper their answers with cliches just to get to the end of a press conference. Yet Gareth Southgate is not being flippant when he responds to a question about the Champions League final by emphasising how Liverpool will be representing England when they face Real Madrid in Kiev on Saturday. With the World Cup looming large, England’s manager makes no attempt to play down the significance of Liverpool’s progress under Jürgen Klopp.“It is big,” Southgate says. “We want our players in those big matches. The experience for the likes of Jordan Henderson, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Adam Lallana over the last few months of playing in those matches that matter – and it was the same for the Spurs boys in their games and the Man City boys – you want them in that environment and to experience winning things.”While a knee injury has ruled Oxlade-Chamberlain out of this summer’s tournament and Lallana has had to settle for a place on the standby list after enduring almost an entire season in the treatment room, Alexander-Arnold and Henderson are part of England’s 23-man squad and Southgate makes it clear that his team will benefit from having players taking part in club football’s showpiece occasion.“Then they know what’s needed,” he says. “They know that hurdles can be overcome and they gain belief from those performances. So I think it’s a great thing for English football that Liverpool are representing England in the final. I know that won’t be seen universally by all supporters. But why would we want Real Madrid to win? I can’t see the logic in that.”It can be fashionable to belittle English players but Southgate believes that Liverpool’s success in Europe is something that should make the country feel optimistic about the future. “When I came here to take the under-21s, it was for that purpose,” he says. “I believed young English players could play in that style. What was stopping them from being as good as players around the world? We’re seeing that with some of our youngsters playing abroad and Manchester City having a core of four English players most weeks in their team.“Manchester United have an English core. Liverpool have the same. And they’re working with top European coaches. There’s an assumption that European coaches will come here and pick foreign players. But Mauricio Pochettino has gone with an English core. That’s a great message for our players. They’re performing in one of the most competitive leagues in the world and doing really well.”It is worth listening to Southgate. For all his inexperience at the highest level of management, he is an intelligent man who played in one of England’s finest teams and he gave a lot of thought about how to structure his squad announcement. Some of his predecessors preferred to select 30 players before gradually trimming the numbers. Southgate, however, was wary of making his youthful team unnecessarily anxious. Lewis Cook, Tom Heaton, Lallana, Jake Livermore and James Tarkowski have been given time to adjust to being named as standbys.“We could have picked 30 or how we’ve done it,” Southgate says. “My experience of this way was that it’s cleaner. The guys on standby have a clear understanding of their role. They have some time to get over the disappointment but they will play a crucial part in what we’re doing over the next few weeks and there’s always an opportunity they may be with us beyond that, which is what happened with Trevor Sinclair in 2002.” The then West Ham winger played four matches in that year’s World Cup, having initially flown home from Japan after not making the 23, before injuries propelled him into the squad and then the team.“We had a really interesting discussion with Stuart Lancaster [the England coach at the 2015 Rugby World Cup] on this. They have to have a bigger squad in rugby because of the bigger numbers and the number of injuries they get, plus they’re together for eight or 10 weeks.“But he made the observation that there’s a difference between a selection and a performance camp and when there’s an uncertainty between – ‘Am I in or am I not in?’ – then it becomes a selection camp and you don’t only have the five that are likely to be out but another five who think it might be them.“Of the group of 28, you could have 10 or more working with uncertainty. You can be less specific on positions and tactical work. Now we know where players are going to be in training sessions. The players can have less tension around what’s coming and can start to bond a bit tighter.”Southgate has spoken about a tight-knit squad. But while he believes that the camp will not be riddled with cliques, the competition for places up front is fierce. Dele Alli, who has had another fine season, was a substitute in the recent friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy, with Jesse Lingard and Raheem Sterling preferred in the deep-lying attacking roles.Yet Southgate was impressed that Alli responded by scoring twice in Tottenham’s 3-1 win against Chelsea a week later and he made the point that Michael Owen and David Beckham were left out of England’s opening game at the 1998 World Cup. Both went on to make an impact at the tournament. “You perform in a World Cup and that announces you to the world,” Southgate says. “That’s the beauty of playing in an England shirt.“Dele is already an outstanding player and he’s going to get better because of his age and desire. We also have some exciting players coming around. It shouldn’t be that anybody is a guaranteed starter. What gets the best out of you? It’s the games you play but it’s also the competition in training.”It is lucky that Southgate has Steve Holland, the former Chelsea coach, as his number two. “Steve Holland is a legend. He’s won the Champions League, the Europa League, the league, the FA Cup,” Southgate says. “I think the bastard’s won the League Cup as well. With his coaching background in developing young players right through to working with some of best managers in the world, he is the most experienced English coach in the country. He will challenge my thinking and speak his mind. We have complete trust in each other. It’s a critical relationship. Terry Venables had that with Don Howe. He would challenge Terry, who would take it on board.”Between them Southgate and Holland already have an idea of their starting XI to face Tunisia in Volgograd on 18 June. “But also there is opportunity for people to play into that thinking,” Southgate says. “We know tomorrow what we would select. But that’s always a slightly movable feast. It’s really competitive.” There are reasons to feel positive."

This article is part of the Guardian’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.There was understandable cause for celebration when Alexey Miranchuk, who had come on as a substitute, scored the third goal to wrap up Lokomotiv Moscow’s Russian Cup final win over Kuban Krasnodar in May 2015. After full-time the club’s president, Olga Smorodskaya, swiftly came down to the dressing room and made sure to congratulate the talented forward – only to get it all wrong.She had actually hailed Miranchuk’s identical twin brother, Anton, and although the misunderstanding was innocent it struck a raw nerve. Anton had barely been involved in the first team and had effectively been forgotten while Alexey shot to the top. In that context, the turnaround that has ensued is remarkable: now the brothers carry Russia’s World Cup hopes together after their paths finally converged in a season that brought hero status with Lokomotiv Moscow. Miracles are expected from both– a situation that looked inconceivable only 12 months ago.For years, everything had been about Alexey. He was the golden boy: a debutant for Lokomotiv at the age of 17 who won the faith of their then-manager Slaven Bilic and went on to become a fixture in the side. Alexey quickly made a splash on the international scene too. In June 2015, when he was only 19, he made his bow for Russia against Belarus and scored 12 minutes after coming on. Soon afterwards he would be named in a “Backed by Messi” team of 10 promising players from around the world selected by Adidas and the Barcelona forward. He received a special pair of boots for the privilege; he has hardly looked back since and the upshot, in short, is that Alexey is already a fully-formed star.While his twin thrived, Anton fared altogether differently. At first the brothers’ careers developed in parallel. At the age of 15 they moved together from their home city of Slavyansk-on-Kuban, near Krasnodar, to the capital. That was actually at Spartak Moscow’s invitation, but before long their academy coaches decided the brothers were too short and physically weak. A greater show of belief came from Lokomotiv, who took them in and put them up in a boarding school. Their mother Yelena, a teacher, was given a job at the school too and the pair say that was vital for their wellbeing. “Things might have gone differently without her keeping an eye on us,” Alexey said last year.As it was, their fortunes soon began to contrast. While Bilic put Alexey in his starting lineup, Anton trained, trained and trained, seeing coaches come and go – but did not get a sniff, save for a two-minute appearance against Rotor Volgograd in the cup. Injuries did not help and certainly contributed to his apparent invisibility. That encounter with Smorodskaya was a low point but Anton looked close to dropping off the football map entirely when, in early 2016, he was loaned to the Estonian side Levadia Tallinn.“People don’t come back from there,” critics said – but they could hardly have been more wrong. The trip helped Anton grow up: he cooked food for himself, did his own washing and attained a degree of independence that had not come easily at his parent club. Things did not get off to a straightforward start – in his first match for Levadia he both scored and was sent off – but he soon became the team’s key player. Over his year in Estonia, Miranchuk played 40 games, scored 15 times and made 11 assists.In August 2016, Lokomotiv reappointed the legendary coach Yuri Semin and everything transformed. Semin believed in Anton to the extent that, before the end of the 2016-17 season, he gave him a first Russian Premier League appearance; with each game after that Anton grew visibly stronger, his performances as a central attacking midfielder getting better and better. When the new campaign began, Semin handed him a starting role.That show of trust was rewarded with some marvellous performances for Lokomotiv, who won their first league title in 14 years. Now starring alongside his brother on a weekly basis, Anton became impossible for the Russia head coach, Stanislav Cherchesov, to ignore and was selected for the squad that faced Argentina and Spain. In a thrilling 3-3 draw with Spain he made more successful dribbles than anyone else in the Russia team and played a part in the third goal.His impressive start at international level means Russia’s recent tradition of twins continues. The Berezutsky brothers, Vasily and Alexei, were defensive lynchpins for many years and won 159 caps between them. They gave way to younger talent after 2016 and, although playing in a completely different area of the pitch, the Miranchuks fit that definition perfectly. Along with Igor Akinfeev, Aleksandr Golovin and Fyodor Smolov, they are arguably the players who supporters hope can make their home tournament extra special. It has been some journey here but, having gone from outcast to assist-making king, Anton Miranchuk’s talent now stands out to everybody.Philipp Papenkov writes for Sport-Express.

David Wagner has signed a new three-year contract with Huddersfield Town, giving the Premier League club a huge boost and ending any possibility of him being lured away this summer.The German, who defied the odds to lead Huddersfield to survival last season, has agreed a deal that ties him to the club until 2021 and is worth more than £2.5m a year, making him one of the best-paid Premier League managers outside of the top six.That reflects Wagner’s value to the club after a remarkable two and a half years during which he has transformed them. Appointed in November 2015, the German won promotion to the Premier League in his first full season and kept Huddersfield in the top flight with a game to spare, after back-to-back draws at Manchester City and Chelsea.His achievements have made him a hero in the town and raised his profile further afield, with West Ham, Leicester and Everton among the Premier League clubs to have expressed interest in the 46-year-old, who had 12 months remaining on his existing deal.Christoph Bühler, Wagner’s assistant, and Andrew Hughes, the first-team coach, have also signed new three-year contracts.“I’m very happy that we can announce David, Christoph and Andrew’s new contracts today on the back of a superb debut Premier League season,” Dean Hoyle, the Huddersfield chairman, said. “I understand why David is so talked about and sought-after given the things he has achieved here; he’s a very talented head coach and has played a huge role in transforming Huddersfield Town into the club it is today.“However, I have never had any doubts about David’s future. Time and time again, he has shown his commitment to Huddersfield Town, as the club has demonstrated its commitment to him.”Wagner said: “The decision to extend my stay at this club was not a difficult one. The relationship Christoph, Andy and I have with Dean, the rest of the board, the staff and the supporters is special. We’ve achieved some incredible things together in two and a half years and now I’m excited about the future.“We still have a lot of work to do as we adapt to life in the Premier League, but this club and its people have the ambition, desire and attitude to take this challenge on.”"

Complaints over Liverpool’s recent league form have been excessive, given the limited midfield and forward options available to Jürgen Klopp while guiding the club into the Champions League final, but the last day equation is straight-forward on many levels. Preserve an unbeaten home campaign against a Brighton team that has won twice on the road all season and Liverpool are in the Champions League for a second year running.

Chelsea have become the first club to issue a payout to an alleged victim since the full extent of football’s sex abuse scandal was exposed but risk drawing criticism for not making the compensation deal public.The club have reached an out-of-court settlement with a junior player who was allegedly abused by Chelsea’s former chief scout Eddie Heath but declined to comment on the specifics of the deal. They have previously been condemned for paying £50,000 to another former player, Gary Johnson, in effect to buy his silence.Chelsea would not disclose how much money was paid to the alleged victim, who claimed Heath sexually abused him at the club’s old training ground in Mitcham, south London. The payment was made by the club’s insurers rather than directly by Chelsea. Heath died in the mid-1980s but former Chelsea players have since come forward to allege he abused them in the showers after training sessions and games.He was said to have cynically targeted boys with single mothers and offered to give them a lift to and from the training ground to allow himself the opportunity to carry out the abuse. He became known as the “man in the van” because he would drive young players around on such a regular basis.Chelsea will be keen to avoid appearing like they are attempting to conceal any compensation payments after they were widely denounced for making Johnson sign a confidentiality clause. Johnson, who went on to play for the club’s first team, said he was abused by Heath hundreds of times in the 1970s. He approached Chelsea in 2015 looking for compensation and alleged the club attempted to sweep the incident under the carpet. They offered him £50,000 and made him sign a confidentiality clause, in effect paying for his silence.Legal experts have predicted the final cost of compensation for abuse victims across British football could reach more than £100m. As of 31 December 2017, the number of football sex abuse victims was 839 with 294 alleged suspects and 334 clubs impacted. Those figures are according to Operation Hydrant, the police investigation into allegations of non-recent child sex abuse.In February the former football coach Barry Bennell was jailed for 30 years after being found guilty of subjecting junior players from Manchester City and Crewe Alexandra to hundreds of sexual offences. The trial cost £750,000 but Manchester City have already spent over £1m on their own inquiry. They have received claims from a number of Bennell’s former players and hired two of Manchester’s biggest legal firms. Gary Cliffe, who waived his right to anonymity, is one of the people taking legal action against the club. City also had a representative for their own legal team inside Liverpool crown court observing during every day of the Bennell trial. Bennell has appealed against the sentence and a date for an appeal hearing is being fixed. City have also been in contact with the family of Mark Hazeldine. Hazeldine, who had been a youth star at City and was previously coached by Bennell, took his own life in 2006. His family and friends have said that they fear he was abused when Bennell took him alone to Spain aged 12.The Football Association is conducting its own internal review concurrently, led by Clive Sheldon QC. The aim is to find out what officials and clubs knew about potential abuse and when, looking at documents from 1970 to 2005. It is reviewing 6,000 files flagged as relevant during an initial review of more than 3,000 boxes from the FA’s archive. The governing body has also taken the accounts of more than 100 survivors of football-related abuse and received contributions from over 50 other relevant people. Chelsea declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian."

The footballer Roger Piantoni, who has died aged 86, was the fulcrum of the exciting France team that took third place in the Swedish World Cup of 1958. A highly accomplished ball player, an inside-left who often scored with his powerful left foot as well as fashioning chances for others, he scored 18 goals for France in 37 appearances.In the 1958 World Cup finals he was a key component of a dynamic French outfit that was also inspired by Raymond Kopa and Just Fontaine. Piantoni scored the third goal when, in the team’s opening match, France annihilated Paraguay 7-3 in Norrköpping.On the same ground he got the fourth French goal when Northern Ireland were beaten 4-0 in the quarter finals, and he scored a late second in the quarter final, which France lost 5-2 to Brazil after being reduced to 10 fit men by an injury to the centre-half Robert Jonquet. The only match in which Piantoni did not play was the third-place play off fixture, in which France trounced West Germany 6-3.To go with his third place World Cup medal, Piantoni won an impressive number of honours in domestic French football with Reims, with whom he won the Ligue 1 title in 1958, 1960 and 1962 and the French Cup in 1958. With Reims he also got to a European Cup final in 1959, which was lost 2-0 to an all-conquering Real Madrid side.Piantoni, though partly of Italian extraction, regarded himself as very much a man of Lorraine, where he was born in Etain, the son of an amateur footballer who played for the local team, La Mouriere, after being released from a German prisoner of war camp. His mother died when he was only two years old, and he was brought up in nearby Piennes by his grandparents, who had left Italy as children.He played his first football as a boy in the Piennes town square with, among others, a fellow future France international, Thadée Cisowski. Piantoni was a prolific goal scorer in youth football, once bagging 18 goals in a single match. Asked to explain the power of his left foot, he responded that he had as little idea as a boxer asked about his knockout punch, but remembered with amusement the time when, as a small boy about to take a corner, he heard a spectator say: “Ah, look at the little chap; he’ll never make it.” He tried to work on improving his right foot, but concentrated still more on his formidable left.Joining the Piennes club in a local league, in the 1949-50 season he scored 35 times and was leading scorer in the competition. That brought him to the attention of the top flight club Nancy, for whom he signed in 1950. Essentially an inside-left, his favourite role, he adapted himself to the inside right position at the request of one of his Nancy managers, Jacques Favre, and he felt that it helped him: “It enabled me to assess the play better, and above all to bring off better breakaways. Also to move much more quickly into position to shoot with my left foot.”Piantoni played at Nancy for seven years before transferring to Reims. They were already one of the best teams in Europe, with players such as Jonquet and Fontaine, and were further strengthened by his addition. Piantoni played well in the 1959 European Cup final in Stuttgart at No 10, but Reims were unable to cope with Real Madrid’s Alfredo Di Stéfano, who scored the crucial second goal.Piantoni left in 1964 to join Nice for two seasons before retiring from the game in 1966. His last international cap had come in 1961, in a 5-1 defeat of Finland in a World Cup qualifier at Parc des Princes, in which he scored.Piantoni had no great ambitions to become a manager, but was happy enough to take on a job as player-coach at the minor French club Carpentras, from 1967 to 1971. In 1970 he became a member of the federal council of the French Football Federation, a post he held until 1988.A family man and a devotee of French history and detective stories, Piantoni especially enjoyed holidays on the banks of the Loire. There, he said, he could feel in touch with his country’s past.• Roger Piantoni, footballer, born 26 December 1931; died 26 May 2018"

Eni Aluko is wearing a lime-green Hawaiian print shirt and is surprisingly sprightly after a week of celebrations to mark the end of her time as a Chelsea player. There was a champagne party bus home from the game in Bristol where the club won the title unbeaten, plus festivities that followed her scoring in her final match at Liverpool. Back in London, Aluko cooked paella for 20 friends at her home and David Luiz invited the squad to dine at his new Italian restaurant.“It had been an amazing week with women who have become good friends,” Aluko says. “Finishing this season in such a positive way wrapped up what started so negatively for me personally.”Between the revelry, there were plenty of tears as the 31-year-old considered reversing her decision. Aluko had grown frustrated at her bit-part role, concluding after five and a half years with Chelsea she would be more fulfilled elsewhere. She has signed with a club in Europe but won’t reveal where.“I’ve achieved pretty much everything I wanted to with Chelsea except maybe the Champions League, which I could still do somewhere else. I love to travel and sample new cultures; the opportunity to play in Europe and learn a language is a big one. But there have been a lot of tears. I was crying on the pitch in Bristol. I have such a strong bond with the people I work with and questioned whether I’m ever going to experience that again with a new team, whether I’ll be that happy – the doubts start creeping in.”A forward with electrifying pace, Aluko has been one of the outstanding players in Britain for more than 15 years, since joining Birmingham City Ladies aged 15. Marcus Bignot, her coach at the time, called her the “Wayne Rooney of women’s football”.Her mum, Sileola, and dad, Daniel, a former MP in Nigeria, moved the family from Lagos to Birmingham when Aluko was six months old. She excelled at school and her parents encouraged her to continue her education even as it became apparent a top-flight football career was a possibility for her and her younger brother, Sone.Alongside playing she graduated with a first-class honours degree from Brunel University and worked as a lawyer. Aluko is adamant girls should not be forced to choose between a football career and academic studies, calling for clubs to offer the same opportunities as they do to their male counterparts.“My issue is young, talented players not having to compromise their education. If you look at the men’s academy setups, they have partnerships with colleges or universities, whereas we don’t really have that with women’s football. You don’t want an 18-year-old girl who’s very talented thinking: ‘I want to play for the first team but I’ve got to give up my education to do so.’ That has happened a lot in the past.“Some of big men’s clubs like Man City, Chelsea and Arsenal have raised the bar in terms of salaries and professionalism of the women’s game. I think there needs to be continued increase in salaries to reflect the attention on the game and its commercial viability. The argument before was that nobody was watching but that’s not true nowadays.”The idea that 45,000 fans would attend a women’s FA Cup final, as they did this month at Wembley, was scarcely believable when Aluko was cutting her teeth in the Midlands. She has noticed more girls coming up to her in the street or at games but what she finds most heartening is the sight of more young boys at Women’s Super League matches.“That’s the biggest change: young boys watching like they’re watching a men’s game, coming up and asking for my boots just as they would with Eden Hazard. That’s not only going to affect their perception of football; it’s going to affect their perception of women, so when they grow up to have relationships they’re more likely to respect women as equals. They are seeing women in a very positive light and in a strong, competitive environment. Women’s sport has become normalised.”Aluko did not set out to become a champion of equality or a spokesperson on problems around discrimination. But she found herself on the front page and in parliament after accusing the former England women’s coach Mark Sampson of making racial comments to her and another player. She also alleged the Football Association had failed to investigate properly, as revealed by the Guardian.Privately Aluko was shunned by some of her former team-mates and was publicly accused of being a liar. An investigation by the barrister Katharine Newton ruled she had told the truth. Sampson later lost his job for an unrelated matter. But after a distinguished 11-year international career during which she won 102 caps, Aluko has been on the England sidelines for two years. Phil Neville has left the door open but she does not know if she will go back.To be going to Russia to work on a men’s World Cup is incredible. I never thought that would happen“I spoke to him at a Chelsea game this season and it was a nice conversation. I congratulated him on his appointment and we talked about him moving back from Spain and I’m sure he’s seen a few games where I’ve played this season.“But I’ve moved on from what was a very stressful, negative period in my life. I’ve dealt with it in the best way I could. Standing up for what you believe in and being honest, telling the truth are all very liberating things. Since that time I’ve felt very empowered by other people seeing you can stand for what you believe, even in adversity. Success is always the best answer to critics. When you look at some of the greatest people and players in the world they all stand for something outside their working lives.”Aluko will be in Russia working as a pundit on ITV’s World Cup coverage. In 2014 she made history as the first female pundit on Match of the Day and believes she has opened the door for other women players to make a move into broadcasting, although she concedes there is still a way to travel for equality.“To be going to Russia to work on a men’s World Cup is incredible. I never thought that would happen and it shows a shift in broadcasting where women are becoming accepted just as part of the team. I think the difference is that if women fail, the consequences are greater.“There’s a tendency for some male pundits who have done it for years to rock up and take it for granted. I can’t afford to do that so that’s why I have to geek out on all the stats and facts and make sure I am not seen as a token woman but that I’m adding to the conversation.”As with all areas of her life and playing career, Aluko will ensure she is well prepared for any eventuality."

The fitness of Romelu Lukaku is José Mourinho’s sole matter of concern as the Manchester United manager prepares for the FA Cup final against Chelsea in unusually serene mood.Lukaku will be given until “the last moment” to prove his fitness, according to his coach, after the striker missed the last three games of the league season with an ankle injury. Mourinho also confirmed David de Gea will start in goal ahead of Sergio Romero in a break from the policy that meant the Argentinian started in Cup competitions.Mourinho will face off against his former club at Wembley after a season marked by vituperative exchanges between himself and his opposite number, Antonio Conte. But speaking from United’s FA Cup base in the Hertfordshire countryside, the Portuguese noted only that he was “curious” about Conte’s future.“Anthony Martial is fit and Lukaku – we will have to wait till the last moment,” Mourinho said of his injured players. “I don’t want to lie to you and say Lukaku doesn’t play, then he plays, or vice versa. We will have to wait on Lukaku.“De Gea starts. It’s not about my trust or confidence in Sergio. Sergio was injured for a long, long time. He didn’t play some matches that normally would be his matches, like his semi-final against Tottenham. He trained really only one week before the Watford match and that’s the reason. Last season I played the Europa League final with Sergio and that was a much more important match than this one because it gave us the possibility to play Champions League.”After finishing second behind Manchester City in the table United have guaranteed Champions League football next season. While winning the FA Cup would undoubtedly add lustre to a season that has met with mixed reviews Mourinho says it will not alter his own verdict of what his players have achieved.Chelsea come to Wembley in desperate need of a fillip after finishing outside the top four. Conte is almost certain to depart in the summer and it is perhaps this disparity between their positions that left Mourinho able to be diplomatic.“I honestly still don’t know what Antonio’s situation is,” Mourinho said when asked if he had sympathy for his opposite number. “I didn’t read him saying that he was leaving, and for me that’s the most important thing. So I don’t know if it’s Antonio’s last match.“Of course, sometimes I read that somebody is coming, Luis Enrique is coming, the other is coming, but until it is official that Antonio leaves I don’t know. I’m curious about it but whether tomorrow is his last match or not, it will not change his approach to the game and his desire to make it good.”On the subject of Chelsea’s fans, Mourinho praised their support of him during his two periods at Stamford Bridge. Chants of “Judas” were directed at Mourinho at Stamford Bridge in last year’s FA Cup, a match United lost 1-0. But the 55-year-old insisted he had never had a bad word to say about Blues fans.“You don’t have any quotes from me with negative words about Chelsea supporters, not one word‚“ Mourinho said. “The only thing I say in relation to them is that since my first day in 2004 until my last day when I was sacked a couple of years ago, they were with me unconditionally. They supported me every day. They supported me every match. I will never forget it because they did what I think great supporters do, which is to support their manager unconditionally until the last day.”"

Even though Mohamed Salah ended up with the Golden Boot award and a Premier League scoring record this was not quite up there with his finest performances of the season. Liverpool supporters will be hoping he is saving the mesmeric, catch-me-if-you-can stuff for Real Madrid in Kiev, for this was a more workmanlike display, albeit one good enough to find plenty of holes in the Brighton defence.There were so many of these in the first half, in fact, that Chris Hughton’s side were slightly lucky to turn round only two goals in arrears. Shane Duffy made three potentially costly mistakes in the first 20 minutes and was distinctly fortunate to get away with an apparent handball from Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cross and then a clumsy challenge on Salah inside the area.Had the referee been alert to either of those, Liverpool might have had the opportunity to settle their nerves earlier – as it was they had to wait until just before the half-hour. It was a typical Salah goal in many ways, because it came with practically no warning, just an assured finish on the turn after Dominic Solanke had helped Alexander‑Arnold’s ball forward with an inspired and unselfish short pass.Solanke has hardly figured in the Liverpool side this season but he knows that, if you can find Salah in the box, there is a good chance he will make something happen. So it was here. The forward had instinctively taken up such a good position that all he had to do was turn round to find the goal at his mercy.There should have been a second Salah goal shortly afterwards, or more correctly a second Liverpool goal, for Sadio Mané passed up an outstanding chance of his own to give the Egyptian an opportunity to add to his haul for the season. One could hardly fault Salah for being up in close support, he almost always is, though Mané should have beaten Mathew Ryan from the six-yard line when he had the chance. Instead he rather telegraphed his intention to leave Salah with a tap-in, allowing the goalkeeper to read it and get a hand to the ball.At that point Liverpool were only a goal up but so were Newcastle against Chelsea, meaning that the mix-up could be filed under “end-of-season irrelevance” rather than “season‑defining error”. One trusts Liverpool will not be as wasteful with chances in Ukraine.Significantly it was the ever‑impressive Roberto Firmino who set up the chance with a first‑time pass to beat the offside trap. The Brazilian has arguably been Liverpool’s key player this season, for all that Salah’s goals have earned the headlines and awards. Here he was deployed slightly deeper than usual, with Solanke playing as a notional front man, yet he still covered most of the pitch in his usual fashion, one nonchalant but somehow expected back-heel pass to Alexander-Arnold at the end of the first half drawing a round of applause on its own.Firmino was also involved in the third goal, after Dejan Lovren’s header had to all intents settled the contest. Picking up the ball in space on the right, he waited for Salah to arrive with an inside run before releasing him, for the man of the moment to beat the first defender and send Solanke in on goal. The simplicity of the move was repeated a couple of minutes later as Salah gave Firmino a chance to score only for the Brazilian to spoil an incisive move with a rather tame finish right in front of goal that allowed Ryan the chance to save.That really was an end-of-season moment, or at least an end-of-league-season miss. Liverpool’s campaign has still to reach its grand climax, and with that game in mind, and in recognition that the two players complement each other so perfectly, Jürgen Klopp withdrew the pair together eight minutes from the end. The Kop does not have a song for both of them, so the chant for Salah was quickly followed by the one for Firmino. Anyone watching on behalf of Real Madrid could only have been impressed by the crowd’s fairness.Mostly, though, they would have been impressed by the fluidity and understanding between Liverpool’s attacking triumvirate of Salah, Firmino and Mané, even in a game in which little in the end was at stake. Now that all three have made it through the league season unscathed, Liverpool’s only task over the next couple of weeks is to make sure they can switch back on to full intensity when the big occasion demands it. Real Madrid themselves are pretty good at doing that but Liverpool, too, have a tradition of rising to the European challenge. Just ask Manchester City or Roma."

“I didn’t bring the magic, it’s always been here,” Bob Stokoe said modestly after second division Sunderland had toppled mighty Leeds United in the 1973 FA Cup final. “I just came back to find it.”Everyone knows what Stokoe said because the words are inscribed on the plinth of his statue outside the Stadium of Light. That is how big a deal winning the FA Cup used to be. When Stokoe died in 2004 there was never any doubt about the image that would be used to commemorate the club’s greatest post-war success. Opinion is divided over how accurately the sculptor captured the manager and the moment but the worst-dressed man at Wembley leaping off the bench at the final whistle to race to his goalkeeper Jimmy Montgomery was already part of FA Cup final lore.Things are a little different now. When Louis van Gaal won the FA Cup with Manchester United two years ago he barely had time to celebrate.His moment of glory – well, the undoubted highlight of a mostly lacklustre two years at Old Trafford – was cruelly compromised by the news already circulating around Wembley that José Mourinho had got his job. It was smart of Van Gaal to have his picture taken with Sir Alex Ferguson and the trophy, because a few days later he would not have had the chance.Manchester City were no better in 2013, with news of Roberto Mancini’s departure breaking on Cup final day. The open secret was arguably a factor in City’s shock defeat by Wigan, though what was perfectly clear was that Mancini could not have saved his job by winning that game. In the Premier League/Champions League era only Arsène Wenger has been able to use FA Cup finals to earn a stay of execution, and even then there were significant factions at Arsenal who felt the end of season party at Wembley was merely window-dressing to cover up a larger pattern of failure.Only twenty-eight years ago, near the start of Ferguson’s reign at United, an FA Cup win represented the first success in England for a manager beginning to feel the pressure after three trophyless years, and even though it took a replay to see off Crystal Place it was enough to convince the board they had the right man. “I needed a trophy to buy time,” Ferguson said a couple of years later, before everyone realised quite how much time in the job he was going to get.One has the distinct feeling that even a Chelsea win on Saturday is not going to buy Antonio Conte any more time at Stamford Bridge, indeed it is debatable whether the manager even wants to stick around for next season. He would doubtless like to finish the season on a high by adding the FA Cup to last season’s title win on an already impressive CV, and so would his players. Conte would then be able to point to two seasons in England and two major trophies, which is the sort of strike rate most Premier League teams and their supporters can only dream about, though the reality is the FA Cup alone no longer constitutes a successful season for a club in the Champions League bracket.The Uefa competition has managed to hijack most of the end-of-season knockout glory, which is why Jürgen Klopp could be in line for a statue, or at least a specially commissioned new banner on the Kop, should Liverpool win a sixth European Cup next week in Kiev. The Champions League final now performs the day-of-destiny function the FA Cup used to enjoy. Win it and you are practically immortal; certainly you write your name into your club’s history.Liverpool have not won the league since 1990, the year Ferguson was fretting over Crystal Palace in the Cup final, but absolutely no one will be complaining if the season ends with a victory over Real Madrid. Younger readers might find it difficult to imagine but the FA Cup final used to be like that. In the public imagination, great deeds at Wembley would often transcend anything accomplished the same year in the league. Arsenal won the title on goal average in 1953, for example, but how many people remember that compared with the number who still revere the Stanley Matthews Cup final of the same year? Aston Villa fans will always remember 1981 as the last time they won the league (and subsequently the European Cup the following season), though the image that comes most readily to mind for most people is Ricky Villa’s goal for Tottenham at Wembley.The good news is that only clubs with Champions League aspirations tend to look down on the FA Cup. The bad news is that because of the imbalance created within the domestic league over the last couple of decades the Cup is usually fought out between top-six sides with Champions League aspirations. This weekend’s final is a case in point, last season’s final was another, and in the 18 years of the new millennium the same five clubs have been Cup winners on no fewer than 16 occasions. The only exceptions have been Portsmouth and Wigan, each with harrowing tales to tell of what happened afterwards. The magic of the FA Cup still exists, just about, but it takes a bit of finding.You need to be an underdog with a chance to make it work, someone able to regard a Cup-winning year as a proud entry in the club’s annals rather than just another hotel to book at the end of the season. Wigan fitted the bill almost perfectly, but for being relegated a matter of days later, yet the image of Ben Watson and his team-mates celebrating in the rain in 2013 is not quite the last example of Cup euphoria running over. Think of Alan Pardew and his touchline dad-dancing routine in 2016 when Palace took the lead with 12 minutes remaining.It was premature, of course, but just for a few moments there was a man who could feel the magic, see his shot at glory. Had Palace managed to hang on Pardew might have had his own statue by now, in a pose as excruciatingly inexplicable as Stokoe’s memorable combination of tracksuit, raincoat and trilby. There is unlikely to be anything as joyously daft from either manager during Saturday’s final, which is a great pity. Wembley on Cup final day is exactly the place where one ought to get carried away."

Betis’s bus made its way through a cloud of green smoke, while Sevilla’s passed the police cordon down the last, short stretch of empty street, turning off palm tree avenue to the Benito Villamarín. It was momentarily quiet outside, just a few stall holders in the sunshine, but inside the bus was different. On the right, a window had been smashed – not there, but four kilometres away, where a Sevilla fan had waved his team off over-enthusiastically – and sitting alongside it was the manager Joaquín Caparrós, exposed and in his element. Someone had put the club anthem on and he was belting it out like a man possessed, the 62-year-old shaking his fists as he sang. In the rows behind, the players banged on the glass. “We’re Sevilla and playing Betis is different,” he said.It is, he knows, different to anything, anywhere – and he’s had a gun pulled on him in the dressing room. Born in Seville and once the Andalucían ‘national’ manager, he had unexpectedly been given another go – 18 years after his first derby, 13 after his last, and five months after a three-decade long coaching career had come to an end. And the man who had lifted Sevilla from the second división and helped lay the foundations for the best years of their lives, couldn’t be happier.“I took it on to help the club,” he said. Sevilla needed him. Asked earlier this season about missing out on European football, their then-manager Vincenzo Montella had insisted: “Non e una possibilita.” But, yes it was a possibility. They had beaten Manchester United at Old Trafford, played a European Cup quarter-final for the first time in 60 years and reached the Copa del Rey final. But they hadn’t won in seven league games and lost the cup final 5-0, which was when they sacked sporting director Oscar Arias and sacked Montella too, making Caparrós their third coach – for four nights only. “In football, you go from whore to nun in five minutes,” Caparrós reminded them.On his first night back at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán, he had run, leapt and shouted, conductor as well as coach, heart racing, jaw too, gum chewed into oblivion, hardly able to contain himself, the man who always said “my red blood boils”. In the stands they went with him every step of the way, and so did his players. “I’ve looked at their eyes and their balls and they’re red and white,” he said. After his (re-)debut, he was still full of energy, hyperactive and ultra-enthusiastic. “This is the hostia!” he said. “It’s the leche.” The consecrated bread, the milk, the dog’s dinglie-danglies. But the milk, he knew, was what was coming next.That night, Sevilla defeated Real Sociedad 1-0; five days after that, they beat Real Madrid 3-2; and three days after that came the derby. For his club, it was a potential crisis. Europe was slipping from Sevilla’s grasp, Getafe up there too and rivals Betis – 5-3 winners at the Pizjuán – coming to prise their fingers apart“They’re preparing a party,” Caparrós added. Betis were safely in fifth or sixth, Europe confirmed, ready to enjoy it – preferably at the expense of their rivals. No pressure. No pressure? “Yeah, right,” one coach said. Everywhere their players went, the fans were there too, reminding them what this meant; 6,000 turned up for their final training session. Here was a chance to complete a double over their rivals 23 years on, to ensure they finished ahead of Sevilla for only the second time in 14 years. Betis coach Quique Setien was trying to calm them all down. “You don’t win just with eggs,” he noted, eggs being balls in Spanish, and he tweeted: “Betis fans can be calm.” It was accompanied by a picture of him tucking into a dozen fried eggs.“I’ve asked my players not to lose their heads; to do what they have done all year,” he added but, they were, one insider later admitted, “crapping themselves.”This was big, after all. “A señor derby,” El Correo called it. “Euroderbi,” Marca’s headline said. As for ABC, they were going further afield, their front cover insisting: “The world is watching.” Inside, where they clearly had a lot of space to fill and a journalist paid by the word, they were busy pointing out this was a game that would be watched in “over 180 countries”, helpfully offering up a list of “some of the countries, in alphabetical order, where this game can be seen.” The list was 201 countries long, including everywhere from ARY (the former Yugoslav Republic of) Macedonia to Zimbabwe, via everywhere else you’ve ever heard of ever and some places you probably haven’t, like the islands of Wallis and Futuna. Nearer to home, they were certainly watching: as the penultimate weekend began, this was one of the few matches with anything riding on it. Riding on the bus, meanwhile, Caparrós appared to make a ‘suck it’ gesture to Betis fans and pumping his fists as he sang and it turned in. Three hours later, he was doing it again. The fist bit, that is.When the final whistle went in front of 55,588 people, the biggest crowd ever at the Benito Villamarín, Caparrós leapt. Marc Bartra had given Betis an early lead before a bizarre goal from Wissam Ben Yedder levelled it, and then he produced a lovely flick to enable Simon Kjaer to put Sevilla 2-1 up, only for Loren Morón to make it 2-2. “I don’t even know how I put it in, but then I ran like a madman to celebrate,” Loren said afterwards. Caparrós, meanwhile, insisted his side had deserved more, describing it as two points lost. But still he sent his players to one end to applaud the Sevilla supporters.The news from Madrid was good, after all. There, AS said, it was “war” but Atlético won it. Getafe had been beaten, meaning Sevilla secured seventh place with a week to spare. That means their season starting with three rounds of European qualifiers on 26 July, but at least it means European football, and if they won’t get much holidays then they can at least start them now. “We’ll go out and play in flip flops next week and that was unthinkable,” Caparrós said. “The derby is always special and I enjoyed it. I’m happy: we fulfilled our objective.” Sevilla have now qualified for Europe 14 times in the last 15 seasons, going back to 2004 – when he was last there. “The season has been like life itself,” Ben Yedder said. “Up and down.” “I have seen things you’ll never believe,” wrote Francisco Pérez in ABC the day before the game. “I’ve seen spaceships in flames beyond Orion and C-Rays in the dark, but I have never seen Betis and Sevilla agree a result: here we spill blood even at the risk of it being our own.” There could be no pact, but ultimately the draw suited both, a happy ending from Nervión to Heliópolis. And, as Sevilla’s players turned to their fans, Betis’s began a lap of honour too, roared by their fans, bouncing about in the middle. “They deserved that,” Setien said. While Sevilla getting to Europe was to be expected, at the start of the season that was unthinkable for Betis. “We’d have taken seventh place in the last minute,” said the president.“I’m not going to say this is a miracle but I am frankly very happy; we have achieved something that wasn’t even an objective. We have done good things this season and we have done in one year what we might have hoped to do in three,” Setien said. “We’ve taken a very big step.”“Everyone happy,” cheered Diario de Sevilla. “Seville wins,” ran the cover of Estadio Deportivo. It was, Marca said, “the perfect party”, their cover going for: “See you in Europe”, while AS’s local edition led on: “Everyone’s off to Europe.” This was “not Alfred or Amaia, not even Cyprus’s attractive entry, not the Israeli Netta … this was Seville’s Eurovision,” Estadio Deportivo wrote. For the fifth time, Seville has two teams in Europe. Only London will have more next year and only Madrid, Manchester, Rome and Milan can match them. And when it comes to atmosphere, maybe none can. No wonder Joaquín insisted: “Hopefully there will be a European derby next season.” Bartra couldn’t agree more. “These games really turn me on,” he said. • “We couldn’t believe it; we were a bit stunned,” Levante’s José Luis Morales said, speaking for just about everyone. Down at the Ciutat de Valencia, the team that had not lost all season were losing. Not just losing, either – getting hammered. With Tom and Yerri at the back, and Messi back home, it was all a bit cartoonish. Early in the second half, FC Barcelona were 5-1 down. Yes, five. Emmanuel Boateng has scored six goals this season – three of them in an hour against Barcelona. “But then,” Morales admitted, “you start to crap yourself a bit; you end up thinking all sorts.” From 5-1 it went to 5-2, then 5-3, and then 5-4. There were still 20 minutes left for Barcelona to rescue their perfect record, but it wasn’t to be. Nine times they had come from behind this season; the 10th was beyond them. And so, on the penultimate weekend, they are Invictus no more.• “It’s a bit much,” Xabi Prieto admitted after his team-mates wore a special Real Sociedad shirt with his face on instead of the club’s badge as he played his last ever game at Anoeta. But for him, captain and one-club man, nothing could ever be a bit much.• That goal from Gareth Bale: woof.• And Mirandés are champions.Real Sociedad 3-2 Leganés, Alavés 3-1 Athletic Bilbao, Deportivo La Coruña 2-4 Villarreal, Eibar 1-0 Las Palmas, Getafe 0-1 Atlético Madrid, Girona 0-1 Valencia, Real Betis 2-2 Sevilla, Real Madrid 6-0 Celta Vigo, Espanyol 4-1 Málaga, Levante 5-4 Barcelona"

When Steve Bruce is asked whether work on strengthening the team will start immediately if Aston Villa win promotion to the Premier League on Saturday, the first thought that comes into his head has nothing to do with new signings. “The one thing I need this year, more than any other year, is a holiday,” he says.The Championship can be a grind at the best of times with all those Saturday-Tuesday fixtures and all the more so when a 46-game season is extended by another three weeks because of the play-offs, but Bruce is looking forward to a break for reasons that transcend football.This has been a devastating year for the Villa manager, who lost his father, Joe, in February and his mother, Sheenagh, less than three months later. The pain and grief are never far from the surface but Bruce, somehow, has managed to carry on working, trying as best he can to lose himself in the job while also taking solace from the heart-warming response he has received from inside football.“You know something?” he says. “In the industry we’re in, there is so much negativity and so-called bad people around everywhere, and when something happens like what’s happened to me, with how cruel it is, then the number of messages of support and cards I’ve had has been quite remarkable. The football world then feels for you because to lose your mum and dad in a matter of 12 weeks has been the most traumatic experience that anybody could cope with.”Bruce pauses for a moment, puffs out his cheeks and carries on. “On a lighter note, my mum always enjoyed Wembley, so she would have been getting her outfit,” he adds, smiling. “She loved Wembley. My dad wouldn’t have gone. He’d have said: ‘I can’t stand all that crap, Steve. I don’t know how you do all that and stand there, I couldn’t do that for the life of me.’ But my mum was a total one-off and my biggest supporter, and she was terrific.”It is extremely moving listening to Bruce and not surprising to hear him say that, in the context of what he has been through over the last few months, winning promotion with Villa would be the most satisfying achievement of his managerial career.In truth, it has been a difficult assignment at Villa from day one. Appointed in October 2016, when Villa were 19th in the Championship, Bruce remembers sitting down with Steve Round, the technical director, after his first game and having a brutally honest conversation about the state of the club. “My initial thought, and Steve agreed with me, was: ‘Steve, we’ve got to stop the rot here and just keep the club in the Championship.’ That’s how low I thought it had got.”Years of failure had taken their toll. “There was no association with the players [and the fans] any more, it had broken,” Bruce says. “So to try and mend that, the only thing you can do is try and get a bit of honesty and endeavour back and win a few matches. I do believe the supporters have enjoyed seeing what we have got at the moment. It has taken some time and certainly wasn’t there when I arrived. There were times when they wanted to rip my head off and rip the heads off the players.”Bruce recruited experienced campaigners to turn things around, including Glenn Whelan, Ahmed Elmohamady, John Terry and Mile Jedinak, all of whom “could handle playing for Aston Villa”, and also made the most of the loan market by adding Robert Snodgrass, Josh Onomah, Sam Johnstone and Lewis Grabban.Yet the player he “practically tried to build a team around” was already at the club. Jack Grealish, who burst on to the scene in an FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool three years ago, has been outstanding in the second half of the season, so much so that Bruce thought the 22-year-old had an outside chance of making England’s World Cup squad. “He’s got that ability to get you off your seat and go ‘wow’, which is quite unique in this country,” Bruce says.He hopes Grealish will give Villa “another year whatever league we are in”, but no one inside the club is under any illusions about the ramifications of defeat against Fulham. “There will be difficult times ahead, I would have thought,” says Bruce, alluding to concerns about the potential financial fallout.For Bruce, however, it is all about thinking positively, which has not always been easy over the last few months. The 57-year-old, who is chasing a fifth promotion to the top flight, deserves a break in more ways than one, and few outside Fulham will begrudge him if he heads off on holiday as a Premier League manager once again."

Gaël Clichy clearly remembers the moment Pep Guardiola changed his outlook on how he would spend the final years of his career. Guardiola arrived at Manchester City in the summer of 2016 and summoned the French defender to his office for a clinical assessment of his future.“Your career is behind you now,” Guardiola told Clichy bluntly. “But you have a duty, every day, every session, every behaviour you have; young players are looking up to you and even if you don’t feel like a special player, you’ve done so many years in England, you’ve won trophies, you are somebody and those young players will look up to you and behave like you are behaving.”After one influential season under the Catalan’s guidance Clichy and City parted ways, but his former manager’s words were etched in his memory. Not wanting to slip into mediocrity for the sake of money, Clichy made the bold decision to join the little-known Turkish club Istanbul Basaksehir, who are trying to break the triumvirate of city rivals Galatasaray, Besiktas and Fenerbahce despite taking on their current incarnation only four years ago.When we meet at Basaksehir’s Fatih Terim Stadium, Clichy, now 32, says: “When I came here I thought it would be easier and maybe I could take it a bit easy. I was telling my wife it was my last few years so I want to enjoy it, but I am working even harder than I was at City. Why? Because the president gave me everything and they’re here for me. When you meet people like this you just want to give back, to work as hard as possible. The Turkish league is not as professional as the English league and I will always remember what Guardiola told me, so every day I will train as those guys are looking up to me, whether they want it or not. I have to change the club.“You have to be realistic – I am not the Gaël Clichy of 10 years ago and if I was, I wouldn’t be here, that is just a normal process; but I do believe I still have something to give the club and the team. When they signed me, they told me they wanted to win the league – it could be this year, it could be next year, it could be in two years. What we do know is that we have all the weapons to do it; we have great facilities, the chairman is giving everything, we have great players and we go step by step, that’s their philosophy.”Despite the club’s newness and it only attracting 5,000 fans on average to home games, they do have plenty of influence and other high-calibre players in Emmanuel Adebayor and Arda Turan. There are big plans to expand the training ground and incorporate their academy right next to the stadium. Three pitches are located next to the stadium and it will be 10 within two years in a plan not dissimilar to Manchester City’s, and it is no surprise the Turkish club are being advised by the Premier League champions. Players of Clichy’s experience have been brought in to improve professionalism.“The Turkish league is not the Premier League but I’ve found a club with similarities to Manchester City; it’s a new club with good ambitions with a good setup and when I met the people from the club, the chairman and the vice-president, my mind was already made.”Playing under Arsène Wenger and Guardiola gives Clichy plenty of knowledge to proffer. His eyes were opened to a new style under the Manchester City manager and the defender is enthused by what he can still achieve.“When you’ve been used to playing for Arsenal for eight years, and for City for six, it’s always going to be a shock. When you leave those clubs you can only go down a level. I was lucky for the last 12 months to work with Guardiola and often you think of someone being a genius of football; but if someone is close, he is the one. I am not saying he’s the best, as other managers have had success with different methods, but he certainly shows you a different way of feeling and seeing football. It was a major shock.”It looks as if Clichy will fall short of lifting another title this season but he is hoping to be part of a club trying to make a name for themselves. “The training ground is going to get better, we have great players and I cannot thank the chairman and vice-chairman enough for the advice they are giving every day to me and my family. It’s been very challenging and it is still an ongoing process to adapt to life here, as it’s a world apart from what I’ve been used to.”Clichy is still focused on long-term success rather than potential disappointment in this season’s title race. He thinks Arsenal need to do the same as they attempt to replace Wenger. “For 22 years, what this guy has done not just for Arsenal, but for English football, people should remember.“I think they came to a moment where people just want to see someone else. It’s not a matter of if you win the Europa League, the league or this or that, if you bring a new player in, they just want someone new. If even they had won the Europa League they would have asked for someone new because that’s football.”Like Clichy, Wenger is still a long way from being finished and the former student believes he has plenty to bring to a different club in whatever role he takes on. “When you love football, you love the game and still have something left in the tank then you carry on. I don’t know where he will go but the club who will have him for whatever reason, as manager or [sporting] director, it will be a blessing for them. They will gain a true man, someone who changed the game.”Clichy has played under two of the Premier League’s most influential managers since its inception but he knows in order to change the Super Lig he needs to stick to his simple philosophies. “I only have a few years left, I want to enjoy myself but for me to enjoy myself I need to work. I am a hardworking man and that’s what I’ve trained to do.”"
football,"What did Real Madrid’s Sergio Ramos intend when grabbing the Egyptian’s arm? He might say he was reacting to Liverpool’s own concussive approach. Either way Salah was done

And fade to white. By the end of a messy, thrilling, occasionally grisly Champions League final in Kiev the most unexpected note was that Liverpool’s fearless run to this stage should end with regrets and a quiver of what might have been.It seemed even crueller still that the final image of Mo Salah’s joyful season should be the sight of the Premier League player of the year leaving the pitch in tears with half an hour gone. But then there are reasons why Real Madrid win these games, why the same faces keep on being framed by the cameras year after year lifting that intoxicatingly shiny trophy. Or in other words: Mo, meet Sergio.Madrid were the story here: three-times champions, with victory capped by an overhead kick from Gareth Bale of such devastating grace that even the Liverpool end offered him a ripple of bruised applause as Madrid lined up for the restart.Yet there will be a sense through red-tinted spectacles of having been cheated by fate, by misfortune and by Sergio Ramos.Make no mistake Liverpool had their moments to take this game by the scruff, most obviously in the opening quarter when they went for the full, blitz attack, drawing stumbles and stutters and hoofed clearances as those princely white shirts looked a little giddy. Liverpool can do this to you, swarming in with the body shots, taking your breath, making the pitch spin. Something had to give. It did. The wrong thing.Nobody will ever really know what Ramos intended as he grabbed Mo Salah’s arm and tumbled to the ground. No foul was awarded, even with Salah lying in agony holding his shoulder. Probably this was simply an innocent coming-together. In slow motion it looked like an expert secret service judo move, the kind of thing you spend three years learning to pull off in a camp in the Swiss Alps, along with the blow dart to the neck and the sword-stick umbrella jab.Ramos might say he was giving some back in kind, reacting to Liverpool’s own concussive style. Either way Salah was done, soldiering on for a few moments before going down in distress clutching a dislocated shoulder. Ramos, svengali of white-shirted bastardism, loves these games. Here he seized another by the throat and squeezed at the vital moment.Instantly the weather inside the stadium changed. The excellent Sadio Mané was switched from the left where he had been traumatising Dani Carvajal. The red shirts seemed winded – and within six minutes of half-time Madrid were in front, Loris Karius producing a gut-wrenching error, placing the ball on the end of Karim Benzema’s foot in front of an open goal from a simple throw-out.Liverpool did not let it drop. Four minutes later they were level, Mané nipping in at a corner to poke the ball past Keylor Navas, drawing a vast cheer at that end and another note in the pure pleasure that has soundtracked this run to Kiev and which will remain even now the dominant note of a lost May weekend in Ukraine.What is black and white and red all over? Kiev of course. Or at least it was for one sun-drenched afternoon as Liverpool’s travelling support added a great sweaty replica-shirted smear of red to the washed out greens and blues and greys.They came in vans and coaches and cars. They came via Frankfurt and Amsterdam. Throughout the day they packed Shevchenko park with a bobbing, burping, chanting mass of sun-flushed flesh and filled the side-street bars with a travel-frazzled sense of Soviet-tinged dolce vita.As the minutes ticked down to kick-off there was a familiar feeling of ravenousness and an impatience around the pre-match hoopla, capped by the massed kitchen foil-clad dancers of the great Dua Lipa, who eventually appeared bouncing gamely on top of a blue and yellow birthday cake stage.Even with Salah off, this game was still there. Mané hit the post. Trent Alexander-Arnold struggled manfully with Marcelo, sniping inside like a horribly malevolent giant tarantula. But without that glaze of genius, the switch of gear that Salah brings, Madrid were able to purr forward.Still it took another painful howler from Karius to kill the game as he let a Bale shot spill through the most brittle of pasta-wristed punches. This was a professional tragedy for a footballer in the biggest match of his life, on a stage to which he will surely never return.But it was also not entirely surprising. Jürgen Klopp persuaded Karius to sign for Liverpool in the first place, then made him his number one. At the end of which, and when it really matters, Karius has made a pair of match-killing howlers. Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Kiev and beyond, the sun continues to rise, dogs still bite postmen, brown bears still seek out the treeline when nature calls. A new goalkeeper looked like an essential summer signing even before tonight.The intersection of luck and design is always a difficult area in sport. Here Liverpool could only bring on a half-fit Adam Lallana for Salah. Madrid could call on Bale, Salah’s equivalent as a player but able to lurk potently on the bench.Liverpool will leave Kiev a little bruised but also with a sense that their one real shot at this game, that full-throttle Plan A, was derailed in the coldest fashion by a more seasoned, powerfully stocked team of champions."
football,"Pichichi was more than a great goalscorer who died before his time. He was a law student, an Athletic Bilbao legend, an Olympian, a referee and a man who ‘lived life on the edge’By Dan Parry for These Football TimesDan Parry

In most leagues the name of the trophy given to the player who scores the most goals is self-explanatory: the golden boot in England, the capocannoniere (head gunner) in Italy and the gol krallığı (goal king) in Turkey. This is not the case in Spain, where the top goalscorer award is named after a man called Rafael Moreno Aranzadi, better known as Pichichi.Moreno was born in the Bilbao neighbourhood of Casco Viejo in May 1892. His father was a lawyer who also served as the city’s mayor and his mother was related to the famous writer Miguel de Unamuno. Football was still something of a novelty at the time to the Bilbaínos, but the youngster fell madly in love with the new game.His wealthy, well-known family tried to steer him away from the sport and towards education, but a life of academia was not for Rafael. His schoolteachers struggled to contain him and his uncle, a priest, even deemed him “mischievous, unruly and a troublemaker”. He went to university to study law, but dropped out when he failed to pass a single exam in first year. Football was his main priority.There are several theories about the origins of his iconic nickname, a term of endearment that refers to his slight stature and roughly translates as “little duck”. Some believe it came from his brother Raimundo, while others credit older kids in Casco Viejo, the local press, fans at the San Mamés, or his Athletic team-mates.The source of his nickname may be a mystery but we do know Pichichi was a footballing genius. In an era when the sport was brutal, this young man who stood at just 5ft 1in tall had a city eulogising over his goalscoring ability. His team-mate, Seve Zuazo, said Pichichi would only ever go forward when he received the ball – “never to the sides and never towards his own goal”. In spite of his lack of height, the inside-left forward was fantastic in the air; his only goal for Spain would come from a header. His cousin, Alfonso Moreno, wrote: “He has an extraordinary ability to head the ball, particularly in set plays. Above all, he dribbles better than anybody and goes from one end of the pitch to another with the ball stuck to is feet and without anyone taking it from him until he has scored his genius goal. When things are going badly for the team, the crowd expects Pichichi to remedy the situation.”Pichichi signed for Athletic as a teenager in 1911 and scored his first competitive goal for the club against Real Madrid in the semi-final of the Copa del Rey in 1913. Athletic won 3-0, with Pichichi scoring just two minutes into the match. His next major feat came in August of the same year, when he scored the first ever goal at Athletic’s new, purpose-built San Mamés stadium in a 1-1 draw against local rivals Racing Club de Irún. The game was part of a triangular tournament that also involved Shepherd’s Bush FC, who beat both of the Basque sides.Pichichi, easily recognisable thanks to the white bandana he wore during matches – supposedly to protect his head from the stitching on the ball – became a phenomenon over the next few seasons. He led Athletic to four Copa del Rey trophies – even scoring a hat-trick against Espanyol in the 1915 final – and five Campeonato Regional Vizcaíno titles. He didn’t have the chance to play in La Liga as it was not formed until 1928 but he did manage to score 200 goals in his 170 games for Athletic, his only club. The player the press called “el Rey del Shoot” (the Strike King)“ was reportedly a transfer target for various English clubs, but he was not interested in leaving Bilbao.Pichichi also played for the first ever Spanish national side, which was formed to compete in the 1920 Olympics. Incidentally, he played alongside goalkeeper Ricardo Zamora – of the Zamora Trophy – at the Games. He wasn’t his usual prolific self in Antwerp but managed to score in Spain’s 3-1 win over the Netherlands as they secured a silver medal, their best performance at the Games until they won the tournament in Barcelona in 1992. Pichichi’s whole international career added up to five games in one month; he had retired by the time Spain played another international fixture.Pichichi never shunned the limelight. He revelled in the fame and adulation, which came with its drawbacks towards the end of his career. He was accused of having an over-inflated ego; his team-mates did not always approve of his celebrity status and even his cousin admitted he “sometimes plays like an individual and loses sight of the team”. When his star started to wane after the Olympics, the fans in the San Mamés were quick to blame his arrogance and vanity for their defeats. Some supporters even turned their backs on him when he received the ball and chanted for his retirement.Eventually, he complied with their request and retired at the age of 29. His playing career had ended but he never lost his love for the game. Pichichi decided to stay involved with football by becoming a referee, even making his officiating debut at the San Mamés. He quickly decided that refereeing was not as exciting as playing.On 1 March 1922, just a couple of months before his 30th birthday, Pichichi’s life was cut short. He had supposedly succumbed to a sudden bout of typhoid brought on by eating contaminated oysters, although his family later admitted his death had been caused by “living life on the edge”. Pichichi left behind a wife and daughter, and a city in grief. The fans who had booed him during his final years as a player were devastated at his demise.As a mark of respect, Athletic commissioned a bust of Pichichi to be made for their stadium in 1926. Ever since, captains of clubs who are visiting for the first time are asked to lay a bouquet of flowers by his statue. After the construction of the new San Mamés in 2013, the bust was placed by the entrance of the player’s tunnel, where the tradition of offering flowers is still maintained.In the 1950s, journalists at Marca created two awards for outstanding playing achievements in La Liga: one for the goalkeeper with the lowest goals-to-games ratio and another for the player who scored the most goals. Fittingly, the first winner of the Pichichi trophy, in the 1952-53 season, was another Athletic legend, Telmo Zarra. A host of magnificent footballers have won the honour – Hugo Sánchez, Alfredo Di Stéfano, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi – but the name of the award remains unchanged: Trofeo Pichichi.• This article is from These Football Times• Follow These Football Times and Dan Parry on Twitter"

Close to one in the morning, deep in the concrete bowels of the Olympic Stadium, Jürgen Klopp sighed with some feeling and prepared to put away the frazzled but stoically brave face he’d brought to the final post-match press conference of Liverpool’s season.There were two last questions from local media. Both were essentially expressions of pleasure at Klopp’s presence in Kiev, where he is hugely popular for reasons that range from Liverpool’s diaspora support to that translatable sense of authenticity. (“I like this Klopp,” was the verdict of one ex-Soviet citizen of a similar age. “He is for the collective”.)Question one went a bit like this: “Jürgen, as the last rock star of the modern era, would you say this season has been a battle for authenticity against the depraved stadium-rock football of Big Capitalism or what?”Question two was even more affectionate, and is probably best summarised as: “Mr Klopp, would you please just say something so I can bask in the glow of your charm and feel that beaming Jürgen-power envelop the room one last time before this is all over?”As ever Klopp played it straight. No. He’s not a rock star. But thanks. And no, Liverpool are not a force of red-shirted people-power fighting against uber-capitalism. They’re a business that also pays a lot of money for players just like Real Madrid.As for question two, well he’s fine, thanks. But he’s also about to turn 51 years old and has a very long journey home. At which point exit Klopp, bowed with a touching familial sorrow, like your favourite uncle at a funeral, and showing all the angst, the soul ache and desire to do it all again right now given the chance that you would expect from a manager of his pedigree.In fairness both questions were on point. Liverpool’s run to the final of the Champions League was remarkable for exactly these reasons. Firstly, Klopp has spent, net, almost nothing on players during his time at Anfield. In fact, player recruitment is trading at a slight profit for the club’s owners FSG. Despite this, Klopp’s team has retained a place at European football’s great gushing financial teat. Win or lose in Kiev, there will be trebles all round in the boardroom.There was some obvious evidence of this on the pitch. Madrid have not been football’s number-one spenders of late. But with the game in the balance they could still bring on Gareth Bale, a player at least as good as anything in Liverpool’s starting XI.For their part, Liverpool lost Mohamed Salah and were faced with a toss up between an unfit Adam Lallana and Dominic Solanke, who has scored just once in professional football. They had nine shots at goal with their star player on the pitch and four in the hour without him. Salah Can Karius may sound like a serviceable spine to the team, but as a gameplan it’s not enough – not least when Salah goes off and someone else has to do the carrying. And really what Liverpool do next is the most interesting question here, one that speaks directly to the lessons to be learnt from a 3-1 defeat to the masters of the modern club age.Madrid’s regal meringues, the cream of European champions, were resilient and also fortunate in Kiev. Yes, these are some creamy, jammy, chewy meringues but while the difference on the night was marginal, it was also consistently and insurmountably marginal.Madrid won because they have a stronger bench, a stronger attack, a stronger midfield, a stronger defence and a stronger goalkeeper. For half an hour in Kiev Liverpool’s plan to negate this pedigree was working. Forced to adapt by Salah’s elimination from the game – a clever foul by Sergio Ramos but not a deliberate attempt to ping his shoulder – they had no other gears to fight against these strengths.And so the game slipped away. By the end of 90 minutes Toni Kroos and Luka Modric had made 159 passes combined, 151 of them successful. Their opposite numbers James Milner and Jordan Henderson completed 50 passes between them. There is a significant gap to make up in basic footballing artistry, a gap Klopp’s blitz-attack plans can swarm around and over if everything is perfect.But he does probably need some help now. This was the nugget of truth concealed in the second closing question in Kiev. Klopp has been a transformative personality. He is wonderfully charming. He has done a wonderful, alchemical job with this group of players.This time last year Trent Alexander-Arnold was being nominated – and failing to win – the Premier League’s PL2 player of the season award.While Ramos was lifting this trophy last summer, Andy Robertson was being relegated with Hull. And yet Robertson lost nothing in the comparison with Marcelo, just as both Liverpool full-backs have looked entirely at home on this stage, utterly in tune with the focused, fast-forward nature of the run to Kiev.Klopp has the right to expect a little more now. He has provided a wonderful service to Liverpool’s owners: primping the global brand; forcing the club back to the grand stage of European football; opening up lusty revenue streams; and at no point questioning the resources at his disposal. Liverpool FC is in rude health thanks to the successful ground redevelopment, and above all the good vibes, the basic positivity created by the spectacle of full-speed Klopp-ball.There is another side to this: Klopp is a stayer. But he isn’t just popular in Kiev and Liverpool. It is possible for a star manager to outgrow the players at his disposal without a little consistent investment. This doesn’t have to be extreme, just well-judged. Look at Madrid: Marcelo and Casemiro came from obscurity in Brazil; Kroos was unwanted elsewhere; Modric was a handsomely rewarded punt; while Ramos was perhaps the handsomest punt of all.But as a minimum Klopp will probably want a new goalkeeper and a central midfielder in addition to the inbound Naby Keïta. The defence looks pretty sound now given Virgil van Dijk’s ability to steady whoever stands next to him, but a high-quality centre-forward to share Roberto Firmino’s load wouldn’t go amiss in this attacking team.Fight, run, harry and be damned has been a wonderful plan A this season. Liverpool can bask in the memories of some genuinely thrilling, high-spec football. But as ever with Klopp this is a moment not to stop, but instead to press even harder."

Concerns have been expressed within England’s multi-ethnic World Cup squad over bringing family and friends to the tournament, given fears that they could become targets for racial abuse in Russia.The Football Association is working closely with players to ensure those family members who wish to go to the tournament will be safe but some squad members have expressed private concerns about potential problems. The experiences of the young Liverpool forward Rhian Brewster have been noted by the players, the teenager having lodged a complaint with Uefa after alleged racial abuse from the Spartak Moscow captain, Leonid Mironov, during a Uefa Youth League game last December.That investigation was dropped by the governing body, which said it could find no evidence against Mironov after an inquiry which involved interviewing five players from each side and the match officials from the game at Prenton Park. Kick It Out said it was “deeply disappointed” with that result, with Liverpool praising Brewster’s “courage”. Mironov had denied the allegation.Fifa confirmed this month that the Russian football association had been fined 30,000 Swiss francs (£22,000) after fans racially abused France players during a friendly in St Petersburg, where the England players’ family and friends would most likely stay. Monkey chants had been aimed at several black players during Les Bleus’ 3-1 win in March. Zenit St Petersburg were twice charged by Uefa last season following incidents of fan racism.The FA has confirmed that England’s planning for the tournament will include preparing players for possible racial abuse, with Pippa Grange, a psychologist and the head of people and team development at the governing body, to cover in her World Cup workshops how to cope with racist incidents.England’s players will not leave the pitch if they are victims as that runs the risk of being excluded from the tournament. Fifa protocol is that the match referee should be informed and he will in turn tell the fourth official.Gareth Southgate has previously stressed that countries, including England, must also “get our house in order” over racism in football but the manager is aware of the history of the problem in Russia. “We work with our players on how we will support each other if anything like that was to happen,” he said. “The most important thing is that internally we are able to support our players if something does happen.”"

Frank Lampard has resumed talks with Derby County in regards to becoming the club’s new manager, it is understood.The East Midlands club, who lost to Fulham in the Championship play-off semi-finals, hope to be in a position to make an announcement this week.Derby have been without a manager since Gary Rowett left to take over at Stoke City last week and Lampard increasingly looks like the man who will take over at the iPro Stadium. The former Chelsea and England midfielder is looking to take his first step into management and he confirmed over the weekend that he had been talking with officials at Derby.“There’s been interest from Derby and I’ve been speaking with them,” Lampard said during his role as a BT Sport pundit for Saturday’s Champions League final. “I’m ambitious and I want to become a manager at some point. It’s a big club, with a big tradition and a big history, which I really like. We’ll carry on speaking when I go home, and we’ll see.”"

It was a moment completely and utterly befitting of the theatre that follows Zlatan Ibrahimovic wherever he struts. Video of the Swede’s first goal for the LA Galaxy, a 35-year drive over the goalkeeper, was replayed around the world. It clocked up over 3m views on Twitter and 3.6m views on Facebook. It made ESPN’s SportsCenter and sparked discussion among soccer fans everywhere. On and off the field vindication of Ibrahimovic’s move to California couldn’t have come any quicker.This week, another clip of Ibrahimovic went viral. It too was viewed by fans across the planet, but this time it showed him slapping Michael Petrasso of the Montreal Impact for treading on his toe. Despite falling to the ground himself in an attempt to win the referee’s sympathy, the Swede was flashed a straight red card following a video review. It was a snapshot of how things have changed for Ibrahimovic in the two months since his debut. Frustration is bubbling to the surface.After Video Review, Zlatan Ibrahimovic receives a red card for violent conduct. #MTLvLA https://t.co/qF8UcCZYuyIbrahimovic has played seven games since his dramatic double in the first ever Los Angeles derby, scoring just once. The Galaxy have won just twice in that time, with one of those victories clinched after Ibrahimovic saw red on Monday. Far from solving Galaxy’s problems, the Swede has accentuated themAfter missing the playoffs for the first time in nearly a decade last season, Sigi Schmid rebuilt his squad over the winter. It became clear rather quickly, though, that the rebuild had taken place with no great vision in mind, no real blueprint to follow. Nobody at the Galaxy publicly admitted as much, but they surely believed the addition of Ibrahimovic would paper over at least some of the cracks. Now, the cracks have grown even deeper. Once MLS’s marquee franchise, with more MLS Cups in the trophy cabinet than any other club, the LA Galaxy have been left behind in recent years. Teams such as Atlanta United and Sporting KC have an identity, a style of play. They stand for something. The term ‘philosophy’ is overused in soccer, but at each of the aforementioned clubs there is an overarching model being followed. There’s no indication that this is the case at StubHub Center. From front to back, top to bottom, the LA Galaxy are a club without direction.It hasn’t helped that rivals LAFC, with their gleaming new downtown stadium, have rarely put a foot wrong. In their expansion season, Bob Bradley has put together a team that has, to date, exceeded all expectations, with LAFC currently sitting second top of the Western Conference, with just three defeats in their opening 11 fixtures. Their star man, Carlos Vela, already has seven goals for the season. Ibrahimovic has been left in the Mexican’s wake.Of course, it’s still far too early to write off Ibrahimovic as a flop. He still has time to prove himself as a Robbie Keane rather than a Steven Gerrard at the Galaxy. But nothing he has offered up so far – outside of that amazing debut – has quelled the doubts that were raised around the time of his signing. Many pointed out that Ibrahimovic’s injury record would hinder him and so it has proved. Some questioned whether he would fit into this Galaxy side. So far, the Swede appears something of a misfit, with some fans excited to see Ola Kamara given a run in the team as a lone striker in Ibrahimovic’s absence through suspension (he’ll miss the Cali Clasico against San Jose on Friday night).After his derby induction, many expected Ibrahimovic to keep the one-man show going. Those expectations have since proved to be unrealistic, underplaying the fundamental fractures that exist throughout the LA Galaxy team. In a way, the one-man show is still rolling along, given that Ibrahimovic’s slap became a talking point. Even when he is drawing a blank in front of goal, the Swede brings exposure to the American game. But did LA Galaxy sign the striker to be a footballer or a marketing tool? Because as things stand, Ibrahimovic is only fulfilling one of those briefs.There were plenty of knee-jerk reactions after Ibrahimovic’s debut. Plenty used it as a stick to beat MLS with, arguing the point that a striker well into his twilight years shouldn’t be able to decide a game all on his own. Now, that performance looks like the exception rather than the rule.Ibrahimovic has built his entire career on the back of being a serial winner. At Manchester United, he was able to twist success in the League Cup and the Europa League into a great, personal triumph in line with some of his other crowning achievements. “I conquered England in three months,” he boasted, with more than a hint of hyperbole.So how will Ibrahimovic spin this if things continue to worsen at the LA Galaxy? This is a man who has previously compared himself to Jesus Christ. At his unveiling as an MLS player in March, he claimed he felt like Benjamin Button. “I was born old and I will die young,” he said with a wry smile. But how will he keep up the act if this tough start to life in MLS lasts any longer? There’s only so many times you can slap an opponent to stay on SportsCenter."

Liverpool have confirmed the signing of the Brazil midfielder Fabinho from Monaco for £40m as a replacement for Emre Can as Jürgen Klopp steps up his summer recruitment drive.Negotiations with the Ligue 1 side over a €45m (£40m) fee plus a potential €5m in add-ons have been ongoing for several days, with a statement from Liverpool on Monday night confirming the 24-year-old will move to Anfield on 1 July after he completed a medical at the club’s training ground.Welcome to #LFC, Fabinho. 🙌https://t.co/Xd7ylCfnqJ pic.twitter.com/nYbV243DY5“I am really excited about this move,” Fabinho told Liverpool’s website. “This is something that I always wanted – this is a giant of a team. The infrastructures of the club look exceptional. A football club of this size coming after my services: I didn’t have to think that much about coming over. I will try to create my own history at this football club. Hopefully, on a personal level, I’m able to win titles with this club.”Manchester United had also been credited with an interest in the player, whose agent is Jorge Mendes, but are now expected to sign Fabinho’s international team-mate Fred from Shakhtar Donetsk instead.The Germany international Can is expected to leave Anfield for Juventus after rejecting the offer of a new contract, with reports in Italy that he was due to complete a medical this week.The signing of Fabinho, therefore, represents something of a coup for Liverpool, who have already secured the arrival of the Guinea midfielder Naby Keïta from RB Leipzig this summer and have held talks to sign France forward Nabil Fekir from Lyon. Having begun his career in Europe as a right back, the former Fluminense youth team product has been converted to a central midfielder in recent seasons and starred as Monaco won the French league title in 2016/17.Meanwhile, Mohamed Salah will travel to Spain on Wednesday to undergo treatment on his shoulder injury, the Egyptian Football Federation has announced.The Reds’ 44-goal top scorer was forced off midway through the first half of Saturday’s Champions League final defeat against Real Madrid due to the problem sustained in a tangle with Sergio Ramos.Salah tweeted on Sunday that he remained “confident” of being available for Egypt’s World Cup campaign in Russia, and on Monday evening it was confirmed he will head to Spain."

Neymar is not one for ‘homework’, but that didn’t stop Unai Emery. “We are analysing some videos with him to see how he can grow,” said Emery last year, “especially in his positioning and how to work with his colleagues.” While Emery’s quiet meticulousness may have proven crucial in the past, spending 12 hours looking over videos for every game, with hindsight his persistence with the Brazilian should be regarded as having been a little optimistic.While Neymar may have balked at the idea of incessant videos, reportedly complaining to the Paris Saint-Germain board about the Basque technician’s demands, Emery might find his new audience in north London to be more receptive. He is a supremely detail-orientated and tactically astute coach, and although this style of management did not play out well in Paris, the Arsenal squad will experience a heightened level of structure in their preparation. “Emery put on so many videos I ran out of popcorn,” former player Joaquín quipped, “he’s obsessed by football, it’s practically an illness.”Where Arsène Wenger’s teams may have descended into the painfully one-dimensional, Emery’s outlook is one of nuance and precision, which may well suit Arsenal’s developing team rather more than the entrenched, haughty collection of Parisian stars.Crucially for Arsenal’s philosophy as a club, Emery, despite rampant short-termism in Paris, managed to maintain a degree of focus on youth. His development of Adrien Rabiot from an inconsistent, naive ball-playing midfielder to the physical, confident, box-to-box marauder he is at his best today should be applauded. While the introduction of 22-year-old French centre-back Presnel Kimpembe, now arguably PSG’s best defender, and Argentine international Giovani Lo Celso is also a credit to Emery’s faith in youth and his ability to evolve talent.The 46-year-old's managerial career began in Spain's second division and has taken him to Russia, France and major European honoursWhile Arsène Wenger is being unveiled at Arsenal, Emery settles in at Toledo in Spain's second tier after leaving his first club, Real Sociedad. Emery, a left-sided midfielder, also turned out for Racing Ferrol, Leganés and Lorca Deportiva before a knee injury ended his playing career at the age of 32.Emery is offered the manager's position at Lorca Deportiva after his knee injury, and goes on to lead the team into Spain's second division. In his first full season, Lorca miss promotion to La Liga by just five points.Emery comes to the attention of Spain's big clubs after guiding Almería to their first promotion to La Liga, and securing an eighth-place finish in the top flight. He is snapped up by Valencia in the summer of 2008.Emery replaces Ronald Koeman at cash-strapped Valencia and sets about returning the club to the Champions League. He leaves Valencia in 2012 after three consecutive third-place league finishes.The first blot on Emery's managerial copy book comes in Russia, where he lasts just six months at Spartak Moscow, and is sacked after a 5-1 derby defeat to Dynamo.After returning to La Liga with Sevilla in January 2013, Emery leads them to three consecutive Europa League titles. Sevilla beat Liverpool 3-1 in Basle to complete the hat-trick in the manager's penultimate game in charge.PSG finish second to Arsenal in their Champions League group, and then thrash Barcelona 4-0 in the first leg of their last-16 tie. On the verge of a European breakthrough, they lose the second leg 6-1 and crash out. PSG also lose out to Monaco in the French title race.Emery wins Ligue 1 and both Cup competitions in France to take his trophy haul at the club to five, but another last-16 Champions League exit leads to his departure at the end of the season.Despite the success he enjoyed with a more counter-attacking 4-2-3-1 set-up with Sevilla, Emery was reluctantly forced to switch to a more possession-based 4-3-3 at PSG after early attempts to move Marco Verratti into a No 10 role failed and the dressing room pressured him into reverting to the favoured formation which Laurent Blanc and Carlo Ancelotti had previously practised. The combination of detailed tactical insight and counter-attacking brought about a glorious, unprecedented hat-trick of Europa League titles at Sevilla, a record that appealed to PSG, a club obsessed with European success. His time with Valencia also proved fruitful, a trio of third-place finishes between 2010 and 2012 being highlights before their recent lean period.Nevertheless, despite five trophies in two seasons in Paris, Emery’s stay in the French capital has been characterised by mishaps that fall somewhere between unfortunate circumstances and outright errors of judgment. Player power has long been an endemic issue, ingrained during the Zlatan Ibrahimovic era. Neymar’s arrival, and the club’s subsequent pandering to him, has only played into the idea that the PSG squad is particularly unruly. Emery, however, while willing, was unable to address this.When Neymar and Edinson Cavani’s relationship exploded following a squabble over who should take responsibility for set-pieces at the beginning of season, with Thiago Silva reportedly having to separate the two strikers after the home game against Lyon in September, Emery said that they could “sort it out themselves” rather than decisively asserting his authority.PSG’s squad in the Qatar Sports Investments era has proven prohibitively cliquey and, the Brazilian contingent became so strong over the summer, with the additions of Neymar and Dani Alves, that Emery was discouraged from removing a failing and noticeably aging Thiago Silva as captain. Another example of weak man-management was illustrated with the cases of both Rabiot and Ángel Di María, who over the last year have succeeded in forcing him to play them once again in their preferred positions, despite the Spaniard’s efforts to remove them from the deep-lying midfield role and right-wing respectively.Understandably, Emery received severe criticism for the now infamous “remontada” defeat to Barcelona last year. Here however, it seems he was a victim of a lack of mental fortitude in a squad, which he admittedly failed to address himself. PSG under QSI have long lacked heart and the Qataris have struggled with, or even ignored, the significance of the club’s identity. PSG’s lack of gumption in potentially era-defining Champions’ League ties seems rooted in a sense that while winning is important for the squad, winning for PSG is not, and when put under pressure, they dramatically wilt.At Valencia, Emery gave his team instructions on USB drives – and gave a blank one to a player he suspected was not reading themThe 6-1 defeat at the Camp Nou was not a product of an omnipotent Barcelona display but willed into existence by sheer determination, a drive Emery, Blanc and even Ancelotti have been unable to foster. The ferocious press and intensity of the 4-0 win in the first leg, Emery’s doing, evaporated, Thiago Silva’s leadership was non-existent and unfathomable mistakes were made, all largely beyond Emery’s control. He has also been forced to operate in something of a box at PSG, constrained not just by his unruly squad, but also by the club hierarchy, with little say in player recruitment policy, leading to a ludicrously top-heavy squad.Whether Emery is the antidote to the furore that has surrounded Arsenal during Wenger’s final years in charge or the correct choice at such a crossroads is debatable, but Emery will certainly improve Arsenal’s players and mould the side into being far more tactically streetwise.His stoic, measured demeanour is comparable to Wenger’s, particularly with the press. As a result, he too will be unable to act as a lightning rod to draw attention away from any negative coverage or stimulate supporters with a fiery personality. However, in contrast to the PSG dressing room, Emery is likely to discover a more malleable and open-minded audience in England, which will suit his style.At Valencia, Emery’s video ‘homework’ was delivered via USB drive. When he suspected one player was not following his advice, Emery gave him a blank drive. “Did you watch it?” Emery asked. “Yes, don’t worry boss,” came the reply. Emery may not be charismatic, but his stint at PSG must largely be viewed as an anomaly in an otherwise successful managerial career, built upon tenacious hard work and strokes of occasional tactical genius.“Arsène who?” was the famous headline when Arsenal last hired a new manager in 1996, and Emery’s appointment will ask more similar questions of the Frenchman’s successor than Arsenal fans might have hoped when this day came. But if the squad commits wholeheartedly to Emery’s modus operandi, then both club and manager have a genuine chance to disprove the doubters and show that they deserve to be mentioned amongst the bracket of Europe’s best."

After three seasons enduring the myriad degradations of life as one of the bigger clubs marooned outside the Football League, Tranmere Rovers earned a return to the fourth tier after a National League promotion play-off final that was mired in controversy from its opening minute.Despite going a man down to a red card after less than 60 seconds, Tranmere’s players dug deep enough to prevail.Having lost another of their men to an injury caused by a bottle thrown from the Boreham Wood end, they have every right to be pleased. Determined not to suffer consecutive heartbreaks after last year’s Wembley defeat at the hands of Forest Green, ultimately they proved far too streetwise than comparative minnows who were almost certainly punching above their weight. A Football League side in all but status until the final whistle, their return to the fold is overdue.“You’d have to be involved inside the football club to see how desperately we needed this,” said their manager, Micky Mellon. “We’ve suffered, people have lost their jobs and to get the club back into the league is an unbelievably proud moment for me.”Tranmere made a catastrophic start, losing Liam Ridehalgh inside a minute after the defender was shown a red card for a shin-high, studs-up challenge that sent the Boreham Wood midfielder Ricky Shakes flying. While referees are generally pre-disposed towards extreme leniency in the opening minutes of match, Ridehalgh could have few grumbles about Neil Hair’s bold call and walked without fuss.“He’s been a bit reckless,” said Mellon. “Maybe he got a bit caught up in the occasion.”While Mellon pondered his reshuffle, his team went in front; the excellent Andy Cook rising above two markers to head home a James Norwood cross after seven minutes. As Cook and his team-mates celebrated the striker’s 28th goal of the season, Josh Ginnelly was left looking dazed after being hit by a bottle thrown by a Boreham Wood supporter.Mellon subsequently took off midfielder Larnell Cole to fill the Ridehalgh-shaped hole in his back four and with Ginnelly still struggling a little under half an hour later he was replaced by Connor Jennings.“He was injured, but it was also a tactical move,” said Mellon. “Connor’s been out there before, helping his full-back, stopping crosses and that’s not really Josh’s game. He did get hit with a bottle or something from the crowd. That’s disappointing, but look, it’s an exciting day and somebody’s got a wee bit carried away.”Despite their numerical advantage, Boreham Wood never really found their rhythm in a first half dominated by Tranmere. A club whose average attendance rarely rises above 700, their moments of quality were rare and they were perhaps overawed. What should have been the most simple of passes went astray with monotonous frequency.Deep into eight minutes of added time at the end of a first half when Tranmere were forced to use their final substitution after losing Sutton to a calf injury, Boreham Wood restored parity when Bruno Andrade scored his fourth goal in consecutive matches against Tranmere. With supporters from the north-west whistling anxiously for the interval, the 24-year-old seized on a pull-back from the left to calmly slot the ball through the legs of Manny Monthe, past the outstretched arm of Scott Davies and into the bottom corner.A man down and with no fresh legs available from the bench, Tranmere were one injury away from calamity and it was unsurprising to see them spend more time on the back foot as the game went on. Mellon could be seen exhorting his team’s supporters from his technical area and they responded by ramping the volume up to a Spinal Tap-esque 11. Norwood had a good opportunity to restore Tranmere’s lead soon afterwards, but despite stretching every sinew he was unable to poke a deflected Jennings shot home.Boreham Wood must have fancied their chances as the game went on with Tranmere’s players looking dead on their feet. They perhaps should have taken the lead when Shakes stole in at the far post only to steer a header wide.Seconds later, Norwood converted a Jennings cross from the right. The Boreham Wood goalkeeper, Grant Smith, got a strong hand to the ball, but could not keep it out. “It was slow, wasn’t it,” said Norwood. “I thought it would never go over that line.”Having restored Tranmere to a status more befitting a club of their size, Mellon was looking forward to the journey home. “I’m going to get on the bus and I will enjoy the trip home,” he said. “Where the night takes me after that, I can’t really tell you because the Glaswegian in me will no doubt climb out at some stage. I don’t care about that, because that’s what it’s all about. You’ve got to enjoy these moments.”"

Arsenal have appointed a winner. That is something that is clear the moment you meet Unai Emery. He constantly thinks about winning and the trophies he has won during his coaching career speak for him. Even at Paris Saint-Germain, where they expected more in the Champions League than he was able to deliver, he proved he knew how to win.Emery has one great quality: he is an extraordinary motivator. His speciality is preparing for matches, speaking at great length to his players. I remember when I was at Sevilla we had long squad meetings where he would first show various tactical videos and then motivational films. He wanted to really get us going, to light a fire inside us. More than once we stayed literally for hours in a room watching motivational videos, so when we got to the game we were really hungry for success.What’s more, Emery’s backroom staff was of the highest quality. His coaches are brilliantly prepared, studying for every big game. Unai and his staff are on top of every little detail. They don’t leave anything to chance, they absolutely live for football.From a tactical perspective, he is perhaps better suited to Italian football than the Spanish game. On the training pitch he works hard on defensive phases and how to counter particular opponents. Obviously, he doesn’t have exactly the same tactical priorities that we have in Italy but he works particularly hard on this aspect of the game, more than many other Spanish coaches.As a person, Emery is extremely serious when his team is on the pitch. He wants total commitment and total concentration. On the other hand he is a Basque, and people from the Basque country are not typical Spaniards. He appreciates a joke and he’ll have a laugh when it’s the right time to do so. He blossomed in the red-hot environment of Sevilla.One of his great strengths is his relationship with the players. Unai talks with you a lot as an individual and he and his staff can really make a team come together on the pitch. One time, when there was an international break, our captain, José Antonio Reyes, organised a paddle tennis tournament. It’s a game they play a lot in Spain. At the last minute Emery arrived with his staff to play with us. It was a special moment and it is in times like this that the bond between the players and the coach becomes stronger.There was one thing that happened at Sevilla which I have never experienced elsewhere in my entire career, and that is having one single table for the team, the coach and the entire staff when we ate together. Usually the coach and his assistants eat at a separate table and players would never sit with them. In many years of football I’ve never seen anything like this.I had a bad injury that seriously affected my season at Sevilla but Emery was always available to me and listened to me, and there was one particular moment when we played in the Europa League final [against Liverpool] that made me really emotional. He arranged to have a motivational video shown in the dressing room before the game, which looked back over the entire season at Sevilla.Among the clips he had chosen was one of my injury, and one of me working on my recuperation. It was a way of making me feel part of the team, and it showed me that Emery knows how to look after everyone. I was truly touched by this gesture.It is not an accident that he is loved by the fans. At Sevilla he had a truly wonderful rapport with the supporters. Now at Arsenal he faces a great challenge. English football is unique and Emery will have to quickly understand this new reality, but the experience he has already had abroad will help him. I am sure he has all the skills necessary to succeed in the Premier League: tactical awareness, motivational ability, extraordinary staff and a winning mentality. Arsenal have made a good choice.• Marco Andreolli, now at Cagliari, played under Unai Emery while on loan at Sevilla in 2015-16. Interview by Fabrizio Romano"

Antonio Conte continues to cavort on the field, waving what could be some valedictory silverware. So there’s no word from him. Yet. No doubt there will be more to say about his position in the near future. Will he stay or go? All we can say for sure is that the FA Cup hasn’t done much for managerial longevity in the last couple of years, given what happened to Louis van Gaal and Arsene Wenger after winning it. Anyway, thanks for reading. Congratulations to Chelsea, as they join Spurs as the third most successful club in FA Cup history with their eighth win; commiserations to Manchester United as they remain stuck in second, one behind Arsenal on 12. The last word to our number one Daniel Taylor, who was at Wembley today, and filed the following report. Bye!

Jose Mourinho speaks. “I congratulate them because they won, but I don’t think they deserve to win. I congratulate because I am a sportsman. They score one more goal than us and they get the cup, and I have to do what my job asks me to do: I am the Manchester United manager and I have to be respectful, not just because they were my previous club, but because they are the opponent that won the cup. But I think we deserved to win, we were the best team, but that’s football. I am curious to know what you say, what people write, because I can imagine if my team played like Chelsea did, I can imagine what everyone will say. I am quite curious. But I am on holiday. I gave everything I could, I know the players gave everything, it was hard for us to play without Lukaku against a team who play nine players in the box, you need that presence. They are not stupid, they know without Lukaku we don’t have a presence, without Fellaini we don’t have a presence, so with eight or nine players in the box, they knew they were going to be dominant. For me the image of the game is that David de Gea didn’t touch the ball. We did everything, we tried, it’s the kind of defeat, while it hurts, we gave everything, no regrets.”Updated

The prize-giving ceremony. United go up to collect their runners-up medals, grim-faced to a man. Commiserations to them. Then it’s the turn of Chelsea, who climb the steps to lift their shiny new trophy. It’s awarded to a jubilant Gary Cahill by Jackie Wilkins, the widow of Chelsea and United legend Ray. Blue is the Colour blasts out of the PA. Ticker tape rains down. And eventually Antonio Conte - beaming, vindicated - takes his turn to hoist it. Plenty of cheering all round ... with the defeated United team sportingly looking on.

The match-winner Eden Hazard speaks! “We tried to defend well. We scored one goal, it’s enough today. Though if we want to win a lot of games, we need to play better, because we just played defensively. But we won it and we are happy.” He’s then asked about his future. “Now I’m just happy. We didn’t play a great season, but we finished well.”

7.16pm BST
19:16

Gary Cahill speaks! “It’s unbelievable. This was to save our season. I’m not saying we’ve had a magnificent season by any stretch, but we have to try to win things. We had a lot of defending to do. They pushed us to the line. We’re buzzing, we got the job done. This is a dream come true, as this is the first one as captain.” He’s then asked if he wants Conte to be here next season: “Listen, we needed to achieve this goal for everybody, no matter what happens in the future. We’re not in control of that as players. I’m sure the club and himself will make the best decision. Who knows what’s going to happen?”Updated

OK, it wasn’t a classic. But should Chelsea care? Nope! They’ve just won the FA Cup for the eighth time in their history! It’s the first cup victory on Conte’s managerial CV. And a first domestic cup defeat in England for Mourinho. Chelsea were the better side in the first half, and defended with great purpose in the second. United only really showed what they could do after the restart. But chances were at a premium for both sides, and Pogba missed United’s golden opportunity to equalise with that free header in the closing stages. Chelsea were the deserved winners, even if the contest was tight.

90 min +2: Chelsea continue to keep United pressed deep in their own half.

7.03pm BST

7.02pm BST
19:02

90 min: Hazard bursts down the left, a gorgeous ball-on-string dribble in the circumstances, and wins a corner off Mata. It gives them opportunity to faff in the corner. They win a throw.

What a chance that was!Updated

80 min: Matic shoots from 25 yards. It’s a rising missile, and Courtois does very well to punch it around the post. From the corner, Martial has a dig from the edge of the box. Azpilicueta gets in the way and the deflected shot loops into the hands of the keeper.

6.51pm BST

79 min: Jones is back on. A rare period of possession for Chelsea. They stroke it around the middle in the professional, clock-bothering style. How they’ve needed this, in the face of United’s near relentless attack since the restart.

Alonso takes too long and shoots low towards the near corner, and de Gea’s not going to be beaten from there. He parries. Moses latches onto the loose ball, to the right of goal, and tries to flick it past Young. The ball hits Young’s arm, which moved a little towards the ball. The decision goes to VAR, but there’s no penalty given. Perhaps Young was too close to act, but that’s a contentious decision all right. There’ll be debates of course, but it looked like a penalty.Updated

69 min: Lingard earns a United corner down the right. What follows is not much cop. But since coming out for the second half revived, United have done everything but score.

6.40pm BST
18:40

67 min: Young goes down the left and is blocked by Azpilicueta. He doesn’t get the free kick, and takes out his frustration by getting up in the Chelsea player’s grille. For a split second, it threatens to boil over. Play nicely, everyone.

6.39pm BST
18:39

66 min: This is still all United. Valencia tries to break clear down the right, but can’t find a gap in the blue line. Chelsea surely can’t keep soaking up this pressure, though. They’re giving the ball away with metronomic regularity.

6.37pm BST
18:37

64 min: A brief pause as Courtois recovers from that good old stretch, while the offside decision is checked by the VAR. It’s fine. We play on.

6.36pm BST
18:36

63 min: Rashford is bowled over on the right. Free kick, which he takes himself. Jones, on the penalty spot, guides a header towards the bottom right. It’s heading in! But Courtois stretches to claw it out. However, Sanchez is lurking, and knees the rebound into the net. He wheels off to celebrate ... but the flag goes up for offside. It’s the correct decision, though it was very close.Updated

6.34pm BST
18:34

61 min: Rudiger lashes a long pass down the left wing. Hazard scampers after it, races along the touchline, and then zips down the byline. It’s like a game of Amidar. He thrashes a shot-cum-cross straight at de Gea, who handles well.

6.32pm BST
18:32

59 min: United are dominating possession and territory. Chelsea are finding it very hard to get out of their final third. And this time United are asking serious questions. Matic has a shot which bobbles harmlessly wide ... but they’re racking up some chances now. On the touchline, Mourinho applauds his men.

6.30pm BST
18:30

57 min: Pogba shoots and wins a corner ... from which Chelsea break upfield. Hazard tears past Herrera, then cuts inside, past Valencia. He’s upended, and that’s Valencia in the book.

6.29pm BST
18:29

56 min: Herrera splits Chelsea’s back four with a slide-rule pass down the inside right that releases Valencia. The right back is clear in the area, but looks for a pullback instead of shooting. Rashford has a blast that’s parried by Courtois. Pogba tries again, but lifts a soft one into the keeper’s hands. This is miles better from United ... though Valencia might reflect that he really should have had a shot himself.Updated

6.27pm BST
18:27

55 min: Chelsea are sitting deep and living dangerously. Lingard dribbles his way into the box and causes some bedlam. Chelsea half clear. Herrera slips a pass down the left and Young floats a chip over the bar from an ambitious angle.

6.25pm BST
18:25

53 min: Rashford curls a vicious free kick into the mixer. It might even have been a direct shot. Either way, Pogba rises but just misses his attempted header, six yards out. Courtois punches out bravely in the middle of a crowded box. United are on top here.

6.24pm BST
18:24

52 min: Young dribbles his way down the left and goes over the outstretched leg of Moses. That was a slightly cheeky one, he bought that very cheaply. It’s a free kick to the left of the Chelsea box, though, in a very dangerous position.

6.23pm BST
18:23

50 min: Hazard is down, having taken an accidental finger in the eye from Smalling in a midfield tussle. Or maybe it was a crack across the nose. Either way, he’ll be fine to continue. A splash of water on the face and a dap with a sponge will do the trick. Pleasingly old-fashioned treatment.

6.20pm BST
18:20

48 min: United have been first to pretty much everything since the break. Chelsea haven’t come out for the second half yet.

6.19pm BST
18:19

46 min: Pogba, dropping deep, spreads a lovely pass wide right for Rashford, who lays off to Sanchez, who slides the ball wide right for Valencia. The resulting attempt at a cross comes off Alonso then back off Valencia for a goal kick, but it looks like United are determined to play at a higher tempo. That was much better.Updated

And we’re off again! Chelsea get the second half underway. No changes.

Half-time entertainment, courtesy of Norman ‘a song, a smile, a piano’ Long. As 78rpm platters go, Long’s 1928 release Why Is The Bacon So Tough? / Never Have A Bath With Your Wrist Watch On is hard to beat. But it’s cup final day, and Chelsea are playing, so here’s his 1933 classic On The Day That Chelsea Went And Won The Cup. The conceit doesn’t quite hold post 1970, admittedly, but let’s go with it. “The sun came out in Manchester and funny things like that ...”

6.04pm BST
18:04

Giroud nearly releases Hazard into the United box with a cute first-time cushioned pass. United flood up the other end, Pogba driving into the area from the left, Rashford miskicking at a chance from the penalty spot. Rudiger hacks clear, and the players trot off to the changing room for their half-time tactical de-brief. Those last 60 seconds of the half were the most exciting yet! Typical. Another 45 minutes like that, then, please!

6.01pm BST
18:01

45 min: ... United create their best chance of the game so far! The ball’s worked to Young, out on the left. He sends an inswinger to the far post. Jones rises highest, but can only head wide right from close range. A tight angle, to be fair.Updated
at 6.23pm BST


6.00pm BST
18:00

44 min: Young drops a shoulder to circumvent Moses on the outside, but is cynically shoulder-barged to the floor. A free kick. It should have been a booking, but no. From the set piece, a corner. And from that ...

5.58pm BST
17:58

42 min: Matic, of all people, channels his inner Garrincha and nearly twinkle-toes his way through a small gap down the left. Chelsea shut that door quickly enough. United have done next to nothing in attack so far. On the touchline, Mourinho looks accordingly frustrated.

5.57pm BST
17:57

40 min: Fabregas hits the corner, from the left, long. De Gea rises and a telescopic arm extends to punch the ball away. Fine keeping with the likes of Giroud lurking with intent. 

5.54pm BST
17:54

39 min: Hazard nips through a small gap between Pogba and Lingard, and is fouled by both of them at once. The resulting free kick is hoicked into the mixer, and Smalling is panicked enough to head straight out for a corner.

5.53pm BST
17:53

38 min: Pogba’s work earns United a corner on the left. Sanchez tries to curl a saucy one straight into the net, but Fabregas is guarding the near post and heads out for another corner. That second one goes straight down Courtois’ throat.

5.52pm BST
17:52

36 min: Fabregas batters one witlessly straight into the wall. This is not a classic. But there have been many worse finals over the years, and there’s still plenty of time to go.

5.51pm BST
17:51

35 min: Sanchez clips the heel of Bakayoko, who was threatening to break into the United box down the left. A free kick in a very dangerous position, just to the left of the D.

5.50pm BST
17:50

34 min: This is very bitty. Chelsea nudge the action up to the middle of the park, away from their goal, where both teams faff awhile.Updated

"
football,"After attending his first Woking match in 1953, Martin Tyler went on to play for them, play against them and commentate on their matches. Now, aged 72, he is joining their coaching staffBy Richard Foster for The Agony and the Ecstasy
Richard Foster

Thu 17 May 2018 13.44 BST

Martin Tyler’s passion for football stretches back to the first game he attended, in 1953, the year of the Queen’s coronation, when Winston Churchill was prime minister and England were beaten 6-3 by the Mighty Magyars of Hungary. Tyler was not introduced to the sport that would make his name at Wembley, but 25 miles south at the Kingfield Stadium, where he saw Woking FC beat local rivals Kingstonian in the first round of the FA Amateur Cup. Bringing things full circle, Tyler has now joined the club’s coaching staff at the age of 72.Viewers often express curiosity about which club the commentator supports, a question he can deal with easily. “The truth is I don’t have any affiliation with any club in the League, not just in the Premier League but in the Football League as well. My own team is Woking in the National League. My non-league upbringing has stayed with me all the way through and I have been lucky enough to work at the highest levels of the game.”Tyler was eight years old when he attended his first Woking match at the ground the club still use today. “We caught a bus, I think it was a No 437, which took us straight from just 200 yards from my house all the way to Kingfield, dropping us right outside the ground.” The Cardinals were taking on local rivals Kingstonian in the FA Amateur Cup in front of a crowd of 3,000 fans.“It must have seemed to be a huge amount to me and just being a part of that made a deep impression. There was a left-winger called Freddie Pink and he scored. I can see him scuttling down in front of us as we were very close to the pitch pretty much on the halfway line. I learned how to watch that day and thankfully after all these years I’m still watching.” Even then, his preferred place to watch games was around the halfway line. Maybe that commentary position was in his blood.Woking won 4-1 but the thing Tyler remembers most is their kit. “I was really taken with the red and white halves that have remained my favourite kit ever since. I got very upset later on when Woking changed to all red. When I played my one game for the club 15 years ago they played in a kit like Arsenal’s with red shirts and white sleeves. I didn’t get to wear the Cardinal red and white halves, which were very much part of that day.”Tyler knew he was hooked immediately. “I became a fan and wanted to know all about the club so I read the local paper voraciously.” Keen to attend as many games as possible, he returned to the Kingfield a few weeks later, when he saw Woking lose 4-1 to Wimbledon. “So in the space of my first two games I experienced the joy of a 4-1 win and the pain of a 4-1 defeat. I learned very quickly being a fan is not all joy.”He attended every match in the team’s successful FA Amateur Cup run in 1958, including the final at Wembley. Woking beat Ilford 3-0 in front of 71,000 fans to win the Cup but Tyler’s big day was slightly tarnished by what happened that evening. “I was exhausted by the whole experience so went to have a lie-down but I said to my dad ‘wake me up for the highlights.’ But, being a dad, he let me sleep. So I didn’t get to see it again until the early 1990s, some 35 years later, when I started to help the club get some stuff together.” While playing for amateur side Corinthian Casuals in his twenties, Tyler lined up against his boyhood club. “I played for the Casuals against Woking when I was No9 and Geoff Chapple [who became Woking’s most successful manager] was my opposite number.” He was also given the chance to represent his club some 30 years later when Glenn Cockerill was manager. “Glenn appreciated how much Woking meant to me, so he asked if I would like to be a sub for the first team. I said the last thing I would want to see as a Woking fan is somebody like me coming on even as a gimmick – I don’t want to have anything to do with as it’s plainly ridiculous.’ He said: ‘We are a bit short of players for the reserves as it’s the end of the season, do you fancy that?’ I had to sign a form as I had to be properly registered. So I played in the last game of the season in the Capital League, which we had already won, and we beat Harrow Borough 3-0. I was 58, while the two centre-backs marking me were only 18 and 19 years old, so they looked at me a little aghast.”“I went to speak at the players’ dinner at the end of that month, where I was usually given a tie but, after I had done my little bit, Glenn presented me with a plaque for winning the league because I had played in the game. I think there was one spare, but it certainly has pride of place on my mantelpiece after winning a trophy for Woking as a player from one game. It was a special moment.”Tyler commentated on his club a few times back in the 1990s when they made a name for themselves as FA Cup giantkillers. He had already picked up some experience from his day at Wembley for the Amateur Cup final some 40 years before. “My friend Andy Smith, who was a year younger than me, couldn’t watch because he was absolutely certain it was going to go wrong. So I was telling him what was happening. In the broadest sense, I was doing what I have been doing since I have been a grown-up by describing the action to him. Not only was it a great day as we won 3-0 but also subconsciously I must have gone in the direction that the rest of my life has gone in on that particular afternoon: 12 April 1958, 71,000 and Woking came home with the Cup.”Sixty years on from that trip to Wembley, Tyler is taking up a position at the club as a coach alongside manager Alan Dowson. Tyler has worked with Dowson for over a decade, having also been with him at Hampton & Richmond, Kingstonian and Walton & Hersham. “Dowse is like the fire that warms up a cold room in winter,” Tyler says. “Everyone gravitates to him. Getting out on the training ground keeps me young.” Tyler will be aiming to recapture his youth and guide Woking to former glories and maybe even a return to Wembley one day. • This article is from the author of The Agony and the Ecstasy• Follow Richard Foster on Twitter"

In a long and often distinguished football career, John Terry has regularly found himself an object of much public ridicule and derision. While most Chelsea fans seem prepared to give their former “Captain, Leader, Legend” a free pass for almost any indiscretion, on or off the pitch, few fans of other clubs could resist a heartless chuckle when the lion-hearted one slipped while missing that penalty in Big Cup final against Manchester United in 2008 before bursting into tears. Then there was that time he needlessly got himself suspended for Big Cup final in 2012 only to turn up for the presentation in full kit anyway – oh how we laughed. And don’t get the Fiver started on that 26th minute palaver against Sunderland, when he arranged for himself to be substituted during his final match at Stamford Bridge with as much pomp and shirt number-related ceremony as possible, just so he could bask in the adoration of his adoring public. Hubris, thy name was England’s Brave John Terry … but now it’s just Plain Old John Terry.In the buildup to Saturday’s Championship play-off final, POJT finds himself the subject of even more public mockery and ridicule, and much as it pains the Fiver to say so, it all seems a mite unfair. On social media, specifically Twitter – which can usually be relied upon as a forum of extremely nuanced football debate and “banter” – no end of people are pointing and laughing at POJT because he has apparently insisted, in the event of Aston Villa’s return to the Premier League, on a clause in his next contract that will preclude him from having to line up against his beloved Chelsea next season. All of which mockery would be entirely justified except … there isn’t actually much evidence to suggest the Villa skipper has done any such thing.Yet.Yes, the Fiver knows POJT went to Villa because he didn’t want to have play against his former club. And yes, the Fiver knows that if Villa get promoted he’ll be entitled to a new one-year deal which he may or may not accept. His manager Steve Bruce certainly hopes it comes to pass and quipped on Wednesday that “we’ll not pick him against Chelsea if that’s what he wants”. While POJT has given no public indication that he will make such a weird, simultaneously loyal and extremely disloyal request, that hasn’t stopped load of people on the internet foaming at the mouth about the 37-year-old’s childishness and lack of professionalism. Having said all that, if any footballer is likely to make such an astonishing demand, we’d bet our bottom dollar on POJT being that guy. But until then, apart from in the court of public opinion, he remains innocent until proven guilty.Join Simon Burnton for Wolfsburg Women 1-2 Lyon Féminin live on Big Website.“I had talks with other clubs and they didn’t sound like a football club.

Steve Corica is Sydney FC’s new head coach, stepping up after serving a seven-year apprenticeship as assistant. The 45-year-old former Socceroos midfielder has been preferred over a number of foreign candidates as the man to replace Graham Arnold on a two-year deal.Corica was previously an assistant at Sydney FC under four head coaches – Vitezslav Lavicka, Ian Crook, Frank Farina and then Arnold.“I’m very honoured and proud to be the head coach of Sydney FC,” Corica said. “I’m very passionate about the club. I’ve been here from the start, 13 years, as a player, captain, assistant coach, youth team coach, and now it’s my time to take the club forward as head coach.”The appointment of Corica, who played for Sydney from 2005-2010, signals a decision by the club to stick with the philosophy and culture that brought so much success under Socceroos coach-in-waiting Arnold.Defensive rock Alex Wilkinson has re-signed though his central defensive partner Jordy Buijs and right-back Luke Wilkshire have both left the club. Bobô’s expected re-commitment is still to be confirmed and, while the club is optimistic Miloš Ninković will also stay, the futures of skipper Alex Brosque, David Carney, Fabio Ferreira and Anthony Kalik remain up in the air. Pacy attacker Trent Buhagiar was signed from Central Coast last week."

Manuel Pellegrini has a reputation for being dour in public but The Fiver knows a thing or two about comedy and it has come to realise that the Chilean is actually a master of deadpan delivery. After all, just look at what Pellegrini had to say after Gollivan convinced him to sign a contract worth up to £7m a year to become Taxpayers FC’s new scapegoat-in-waiting: “I think West Ham has a very good team. I know all of the players and I saw most of the games that they played last season.” Apart from the ones where Joe Hart had his shoelaces tied together and Patrice Evra looked like he was busy thinking about what he was going to post on Instagram, of course. The point here is that Pellegrini managed to keep a straight face as the words fell out of his mouth before magically materialising on the club’s official site and, if nothing else, at least more hilarious lines like that will have them rolling in the aisles at the D1ldoD0me next season. Seems The Fiver’s got some competition!But maybe Pellegrini was just being nice. Because having worked with elite talents like Him, Sergio Agüero, Yaya Touré, Martin Demichelis and Jesús Navas, it is unlikely that he has surveyed a squad that looks like it’s been cobbled together with twigs and old chewing gum by a teenager whose point of reference is Football Manager 2012 and thought that Andy Carroll could be his new Juan Román Riquelme. No. No, no, no. It was a joke. A funny joke made by one of football’s great raconteurs, whose spirits were high after fulfilling a lifelong dream to follow in the footsteps of Avram Grant and Glenn Roeder and to get a chance to see the famous bubble machine up close.West Ham are happy, though, which is nice. Makes a change. And at least they’ve appointed a new manager, which puts them one step ahead of Arsenal. That might not last for long, though, because it seems the north Londoners have identified the man to replace Arsène Wenger – ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for Tactics Tim! Not really. Calm down, Troopz. That was a joke too, The Fiver’s attempt to compete with Manuel the Mirthful. The actual truth is that the Gunners have spent the past week leading Mikel Arteta on a merry song and dance before thanking the Manchester City coach for his time, showing him towards the door marked Do One and asking him to send through Unai Emery. Some have said the Spaniard’s record of success in Big Vase and fine eye for detail will make him the perfect fit at the Emirates, although The Fiver reckons it was PSG’s capitulation against Barcelona last year that made the difference. Either way, it’s all fun and games in the capital.“Glad to sign up to do this show next year. Great lads and will be a great show. My fee for the show will be going to to a couple of charties.

José Mourinho is hopeful of making Porto’s Diogo Dalot his first signing of the summer. Manchester United’s manager is targeting the 19-year-old as a long-term successor to Antonio Valencia at right-back.Dalot has a release clause of €20m (£17.5m) but it is understood this is yet to be triggered by United for a player who made his debut last season, finishing with seven appearances, six of which were in Porto’s triumphant domestic campaign.Dalot can also play in midfield and at left-back, the position he has operated in primarily for Sérgio Conceição’s side. He completed all of the 0-0 draw at Liverpool in the Champions League last-16 second leg in March as Porto were knocked out 5-0 on aggregate.Matteo Darmian, who has been a reserve for Mourinho in both full-back slots, is expected to leave, so Dalot is seen as a replacement for the Italian and as a challenger for Valencia’s first-team berth.The teenager was a member the Portugal Under-16 side who won the European Championship two years ago and the Under-17 team who won the corresponding competition 12 months ago.Mourinho is monitoring Gareth Bale’s situation at Real Madrid and hopes to sign Shakhtar Donetsk’s Fred as a midfield successor to Michael Carrick, who has retired. He is also interested in Tottenham’s Toby Alderweireld."

Gary Cahill, the Chelsea captain, has urged the club’s board to end the uncertainty surrounding Antonio Conte’s future at Stamford Bridge after leading his team to the FA Cup, a success which went some way towards “saving” the club’s season.Chelsea are expected to sack Conte despite the Italian having made clear his intention to honour the final 12 months of his £9m-a-year contract in the wake of the 1-0 victory over Manchester United in Saturday’s final. That win ensured the 48-year-old has claimed major silverware in each of his seasons in charge but the relationship with the hierarchy, strained since last summer, appears fractured beyond repair.The head coach has aired his grievances, largely over recruitment policy, repeatedly over the course of a turbulent campaign and his post-match comments on Saturday, insisting he would not change and that better players were needed to pursue a more expansive brand of football, in effect equated to a “back-me-or-sack-me” message. His players admitted the ambiguity over Conte’s future had been unsettling during a disappointing title defence, with Chelsea having ended up outside the Champions League places in fifth and 30 points behind Manchester City.“Certainly we’ve felt the sense of uncertainty,” said Cahill, who has now claimed seven major trophies in a little over six years at the club. “That is obvious to everybody in the last few months. What I can say is that the players do not have any impact on that situation. I am sure, if I was a guessing man, that the club and manager will have spoken. Let’s see. I am sure the manager will make the best decision for himself and his family. I am sure the club will make the best decision what they feel.”Those sentiments were echoed by the goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who is entering the final year of his contract at the club and suggested he would know only “after the World Cup if I am a Chelsea player next year”. Asked what needs to change for Chelsea to challenge for the top four again next season, Cahill added: “Probably for the uncertainty to be put to bed and whatever is going to happen to happen. It’s totally out of our hands.“All I can say is that it has been a great finish. Winning this trophy feels absolutely amazing. I felt that we really had to win this game to save the season and, in the end, we have won a trophy which a number of teams have not managed to do and it is very difficult to do. If the manager doesn’t stay next year, then he has gone away with a Premier League and an FA cup. That is something that everyone at the club can be proud of.”"

This was supposed to be a season of change in Serie A. VAR would put an end to the old polemics about match officials favouring the big clubs, while Milan’s lavish transfer spending would restore them as title contenders. Juventus, shorn of Leonardo Bonucci and Dani Alves, looked vulnerable after losing to Lazio in August’s Supercoppa.By the end, what we had was the same old story. The bianconeri lifted their seventh consecutive scudetto – benefiting from a bad refereeing decision at a vital moment just when they appeared to be unravelling in late April. Milan finished sixth, and might yet be excluded from the Europa League after failing to meet Uefa’s financial fair play requirements.Same old, same old. And yet, there was so much to enjoy along the way. Napoli, despite faltering at the end, produced a sensational campaign, becoming the first team ever to pick up more than 90 points and not win Serie A. Roma, in their first season under Eusebio di Francesco, reached a Champions League semi-final after a comeback for the ages against Barcelona. Lazio scored 89 goals in 38 games.Fans were enraptured by emerging young talent, from Sergej Milinkovic-Savic to Cengiz Under, Patrick Cutrone, Federico Chiesa and Pietro Pellegri – who made his dad cry by becoming the youngest player ever to grab a Serie A double. Average attendances across the league rose by almost 2,500.This was a season marked by sadness, too, following the death of Davide Astori. The summer pause might yet be the hardest time for his Fiorentina team-mates, for whom playing games – and winning them – became a coping mechanism.Juventus players were applauded by fans of the Viola – their bitter rivals – after flying directly back from their Champions League game at Tottenham to attend Astori’s funeral. It was a reminder that football remains, as it ever was, a game: the most important of the least important of things.Six weeks later, Fiorentina effectively handed Juventus the Scudetto with a 3-0 rout of Napoli. The ending might feel familiar, yet it is easy to forget how many improbable twists and turns we witnessed along the way. His team-mate Ciro Immobile finished joint-top of the scoring charts and Luis Alberto had more assists, but for me Lazio’s Serb midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic was this season’s standout performer. Twelve goals from midfield are no small thing, but to fully appreciate his contribution you need to see his outlandish blend of power and finesse in action. The expectation is that he will be sold this summer. In this post-Neymar transfer market, the €100m+ transfer fee being sought by Claudio Lotito does not feel like an unjustifiable sum.5) Federico Bernardeschi tees himself up against Spal.4) Foot like a traction engine dept: take your pick from Suso against Udinese or Sampdoria’s Lucas Torreira against Chievo.3) Duván Zapata goes coast to coast for Samp against Udinese. 2) Simy’s overhead kick for Crotone against Juventus was good. But Andrea Belotti’s for Torino against Sassuolo was better.1) Oh nothing, just a backheel volley lob from Ciro Immobile to equalise in the 94th minute of an away game.Benevento had lost the first 14 games of their first-ever top-flight campaign – more than once snatching defeat from the jaws of a draw – before hosting Milan at the start of December. This time they would be the ones to find a 95th-minute equaliser, courtesy of goalie Alberto Brignoli – whose eyes-closed technique supported his own claim that he’s afraid of heading the ball.Gianluigi Donnarumma had been in erratic form for Milan after signing a lucrative new deal following his stand-off with directors last summer. But the point-blank stop he pulled off to deny Arkadiusz Milik an injury-time winner in April was a reminder of his outrageous potential. Honourable mention: Torreira comes to Sampdoria’s rescue against Spal. It’s just a shame he wasn’t playing in goal(3-5-2) Alisson; Milan Skriniar, Kalidou Koulibaly, Giorgio Chiellini; Douglas Costa, Luis Alberto, Miralem Pjanic, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, Lorenzo Insigne; Mauro Icardi, Ciro Immobile.Subs: Mattia Perin, Aleksandar Kolarov, Alex Sandro, Davide Astori, Allan, Jordan Veretout, Josip Ilicic, Suso, Papu Gómez, Edin Dzeko, Paulo Dybala.A big part of me wants to give this award to Simone Inzaghi. He has taken other teams’ trash and turned it into treasure – from Luis Alberto to Immobile – developing tactics that exploit his players’ strengths and fostering a blisteringly direct style that is both effective and wildly entertaining. Lazio faced Juventus three times this season and outplayed the champions on every occasion.In the end, the biancocelesti did come up short, and Inzaghi’s substitutions in that final game against Inter were questionable. The nerazzurri’s own manager, Luciano Spalletti, might deserve consideration here for steering his team back into the Champions League for the first time in six years. Then again, how to explain that almost catastrophic run through December and January?You could likewise make a case for Maurizio Sarri, who took Napoli further than even he might have imagined possible at the outset – and especially when you consider the injuries to Arkadiusz Milik and Faouzi Ghoulam. But did his reluctance to rotate his starting XI cause them to fade down the stretch? Eusebio Di Francesco impressed at Roma, but did his best work in Europe.And so I am left with the obvious choice. Massimiliano Allegri likes to protest that a manager can only make, at most, a 5% impact on the performance of his team, and yet his knack for changing games, and seasons, on the fly is undeniable. There were times this season when Juventus looked a mess, muddling through 36 different starting lineups in 37 games and playing extremely stodgy football.Yet they finished with 95 points and an unprecedented fourth domestic double. When the chips were down away to Lazio, to Inter, even to Napoli early in the season – when Juventus were already trailing by four points – his team always found a way to win. Federico Chiesa, predicting as a little boy that he would score Fiorentina’s goals after Gabriel Batistuta moved on.Antonio Candreva’s endless futile crossing could drive Inter fans to distraction. But he sure nailed this 30-yard ball to himself.Cristián Zapata provided the headed assist as his brother Duván opened the scoring for Sampdoria against Milan in September. It’s just a shame that Cristian plays for the rossoneri.Honourable mention: Bastos’s son was not impressed at being made to leave the pitch before Lazio’s home game against Cagliari. Mario Mandzukic, talking his way from a yellow card to a red in under three seconds. “If my grandfather had three balls he’d be a pinball machine” – Gennaro Gattuso, responding to suggestions that Milan’s season might look very different if it weren’t for a few key incidents going against them in big games."

A video has been doing the rounds in the last couple of days showing the moment when Fagner, a defender for Corinthians, is waiting to discover whether he has been named in Brazil’s squad for the World Cup. It is lovely to see. Fagner is with his family – lots of family, mostly wearing that famous yellow kit – but standing apart, listening to the names being announced, one by one, on television. If he looks nervous it is understandable bearing in mind his whole career, at the age of 28, has brought him only four caps. He has clearly not had any advance warning. And then, finally, it is his name read out and, amid the screams and the hugs, we see what it means for a footballer to be selected for this tournament.Festa na casa do lateral direito Fagner... CONVOCADO PARA A SELEÇÃO BRASILEIRA! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 pic.twitter.com/yPIDns1IxkUnfortunately, nobody had a video camera on Trent Alexander‑Arnold when he discovered that he will also be in Russia this summer but it is safe to assume it was a similar kind of euphoria. Jürgen Klopp, the Liverpool manager, gave him the news after an early‑morning telephone call from Gareth Southgate. Liverpool’s players were catching a flight to Marbella for a warm-weather training camp and Klopp approached the 19-year-old defender on the bus taking the players across the runway at John Lennon airport. “What are your plans for the summer?” Klopp wanted to know, wearing a smile that revealed he knew the answer.The plane had just touched down in Málaga when the Football Association announced England’s squad and in the absence of any controversy – and let’s face it, the absence of Jack Wilshere and Jonjo Shelvey is hardly up there with Paul Gascoigne trashing Glenn Hoddle’s hotel room in 1998 – the inclusion of Alexander-Arnold should be a reminder that these are, in essence, special moments for the players who have made the cut.Alexander-Arnold, brought up just down the road from Liverpool’s training ground, has a Champions League final coming up on Saturday week. After that, he will be going to a World Cup, as the youngest player in Southgate’s squad. England have now taken a teenager to their last four major tournaments, a run featuring Marcus Rashford at Euro 2016, Raheem Sterling and Luke Shaw for the 2014 World Cup and Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain and Jack Butland at Euro 2012.Klopp kept it relatively low-key and understandably so, perhaps, when Adam Lallana, another Liverpool player, has been left out on the back of an injury-disrupted season. Ideally, Southgate would have liked Lallana in his starting lineup but the England manager concluded it would be difficult selecting someone who has started only three games all season. Southgate was tempted but his decision-making throughout this whole process has been guided by the principle that if a player was not involved for his club side he should not expect to be selected for his country.Southgate made that very point in one of his first meetings with the England players and, barring the odd exception, he has stuck by it during his 20 months in charge. His choices will always divide opinion – this being a nation of roughly 50 million England managers in every World Cup year – but at least it makes a change from the days when someone in his position could be guaranteed to pick their favourites come what may.Of the 23 players heading to Russia, John Stones, with two Premier League starts since 20 January, can count himself slightly fortunate on that front. Equally, could anyone muster a reasonable case for the omission of the Manchester City player?Danny Rose might also consider himself lucky to get the call ahead of Ryan Bertrand after an in-out season for Spurs. Likewise, it is not so controversial that Southgate should expect an interrogation on the subject when he holds a news conference at Wembley on Thursday.As for Gary Cahill, he had been vulnerable after falling out of favour at Chelsea, meaning he was left out of England’s games against the Netherlands and Italy in March. Yet Cahill’s return to the Chelsea team has been timed well and, with 58 caps, his experience counts in his favour bearing in mind the lack of tournament knowhow among the squad as a whole. Together, the players chosen by Southgate have a total of 449 appearances, the lowest of any England squad for a World Cup since 1962, when Walter Winterbottom selected a group with 322 caps.At least Lallana has made it on to England’s standby list. Joe Hart, on the other hand, does not even have that small consolation, with Burnley’s Tom Heaton the first reserve in case any of the three goalkeepers – Jordan Pickford, Butland and Nick Pope – has to withdraw before Fifa’s cutoff point on 17 June, the day before England’s opening assignment against Tunisia at the Volgograd Arena.Wilshere is also completely out of the picture as far as Southgate is concerned, with Lewis Cook and Jake Livermore on the standby list of midfielders, and there was noticeably no mention of the Arsenal player when the FA asked England’s manager about the “tough phone calls” to the nearly men.Southgate spoke at length about Hart and Bertrand but did not extend his sympathies to Wilshere. Hart and Bertrand, he pointed out, had been prominently involved in England’s qualification programme. Wilshere, in contrast, had not played for England since Euro 2016 and Southgate, harsh as it may sound, was being generous to call him on Tuesday to explain the reasons for leaving him out. Not every manager would have felt it necessary.The downside is that England’s squad not only lacks an experienced goalkeeper, an elite centre-half and an inspirational captain but still hasn’t solved the problem of finding a natural playmaker – someone to take care of the ball, the old‑fashioned way.That, however, is a problem for English football as a whole, not just Southgate, and overall it is difficult to argue too vehemently with his choices. Southgate will just have to hope Harry Kane, Sterling and his other mandatory first-team picks can play at the point of maximum expression. Though the danger, of course, is that we are now entering what English football knows as the metatarsal zone."

When Neil Warnock described Fulham as “the Manchester City of the Championship” he was not talking about the transfer fees. Fulham had a net spend of around £3m this season and their most expensive signing, the forward Rui Fonte, has been a conspicuous failure. No, the Cardiff manager was talking about the passing. Top in the division for completion (83.1%) and total passes (24,857), Fulham were also the side with the most accurate short passes, second most shots on target and the highest average possession.Fulham have a style that, as Warnock said, is easy on the eye. So how does Slavisa Jokanovic go about instilling such a style in his players? He drills them on turnovers. “At training, everything is about winning the ball back,” says the midfielder Kevin McDonald. “Press after loss, press after loss, all the time. We know we have to earn the right to play and the manager drills it in us every day. We will try and win the ball back as soon as we lose it and then keep the ball, make them run around and try and create chances, tire them out.”That the manager of the Championship’s most attractive side, who contest the play-off final with Aston Villa on Saturday, concentrates first and foremost on work without the ball shows something important about Jokanovic. The 49-year-old Serb has been at Craven Cottage for two and a half years. It is his seventh club as a manager and the sixth country he has coached in. He has accumulated experience everywhere from Spain to Thailand and it is reflected in his skills. This is a manager rounded in his approach, one who can be flexible. Not that you would mess with him, as anyone who has been in his presence would confirm.“I think Serbians are known to be voyagers,” says Jordi Cruyff who, as director of football at Maccabi Tel Aviv, hired Jokanovic as manager in 2015. “They’re really a country that exports a lot. Slavisa had an adventure in Thailand, he was in England, he was in Spain, then he was with us for a period of time. I think it enriches his football vision. It’s based on different ways of seeing football. I think that’s a benefit for any manager nowadays.”Jokanovic spent only six months in Israel before accepting an offer from Fulham. But he left on good terms having qualified the club for the group stages of the Champions League for the first time in 11 years. His versatility and ability to react to circumstances was clear. “He played various systems,” Cruyff says. “He does like to play from behind but he also likes to adapt himself to moments that he might not have control of. I think his reading of the game was very good.”By the time Fulham hired Jokanovic in December 2015, Tel Aviv had had several approaches. “He said no to everything,” says Cruyff, “including to clubs in La Liga. But when Fulham came we all knew that he wanted to go back. He loves London, he likes the style, he loves the football and maybe deep inside there was some unfinished business.”Watford fans remember fondly the match that earned them promotion, a game at Brighton in which Jokanovic hooked Ikechi Anya after 26 minutes, changed the shape and saw the opening goal in a 2-0 win arrive three minutes later. Within a month Jokanovic had left, saying the owners’ reluctance to give him a new contract made it clear he was not wanted. This situation has not been replicated at Fulham; in December he signed a contract until 2019 and further negotiations are expected should the Cottagers achieve promotion.Radomir Antic signed Jokanovic as a player for Real Oviedo in the 1990s and remains a close friend of his compatriot. Antic, the only person to have managed Real Madrid, Atlético and Barcelona, says he and Jokanovic still discuss tactical matters, such as the redeployment of Ryan Sessegnon from full-back to winger, a shift crucial to Fulham’s rampant form in 2018.“He was an important player for me in the mid-90s,” says Antic, “When he took his first touch on the ball you could see he always had a solution for what to do next. I think he is like this as a manager. He will look for players who are ready to learn, and work with them to build a system that works to their strengths. This is the case, for example, with Aleksandar Mitrovic [who has 12 goals in 19 appearances since joining on loan from Newcastle].”No one would describe the 6ft 2in Jokanovic as a pushover, however. His glare alone is enough to put fear into people, an indication of an intensity that has transformed Fulham from relegation candidates to being on the verge of the Premier League. “He can be a bit intimidating, I’m sure, for certain people,” says McDonald. “I wouldn’t say he’s scary but I wouldn’t cross him. He puts confidence in you and when you go out on the pitch you feel like you’re going to win. That’s what he wants. But if we’re drifting away from that, he’ll do whatever it takes to get back to it.”"

Maurizio Sarri has dropped a strong hint that his time at Napoli is drawing to a close amid reports suggesting he will leave the Serie A club.The 59-year-old coach has been linked with Premier League side Chelsea, who are managed by his fellow Italian Antonio Conte, and talks over a new contract at Napoli have stalled in recent weeks. Club president Aurelio De Laurentiis said this weekend that “time is up” for the Naples-born tactician to make a decision over his future at the Stadio San Paolo.Following Sunday’s 2-1 home victory over Crotone, which saw the Azzurri end the season with 91 points but finish as runners-up to Juventus, Sarri told La Gazzetta dello Sport: “Everything in life ends and it is better to finish things after writing a beautiful story. I don’t know if I will stay, I have to talk about it with my family.“The situation is complicated. You can’t say you’re ready to go and try again with this squad when you don’t know that everyone will remain here. I don’t know if the club will manage to keep the players who have release clauses when offers will come in from big clubs. What I do think is that I could not go directly to another Italian team, and that if I had to make a change I would prefer to go abroad.”Napoli led the championship at certain times during the recently-concluded campaign and were only cut adrift by champions Juve over the final few fixtures, with the final gap standing at four points.Former Empoli boss Sarri, who joined Napoli in June 2015, added: “We devoted so much to getting more than 90 points and until now that’s all I’d been thinking about. Tomorrow (Monday) I will talk to my family and work out what is the best thing to do. I know the president needs an answer from me as soon as possible as he needs to plan.”On Sunday De Laurentiis had told Gazzetta.it: “Is Sarri staying? You’ll have to ask him. He’s never wanted to answer, always leaving it to his agent. For me the deadline has passed, time is up. We have to move forward. I’m not saying he’ll leave but there is a release clause and we’ll see what happens.”"

A quick highlights reel of Arsenal’s away performances from last season will tell Unai Emery all he needs to know about how an injection of organisation and motivation are paramount. The concentration lapses, the losing of leads, the lack of robustness, need knocking on the head from day one. Whether it was complacency or anxiety or a weird mixture of both, it needs addressing. The players should be ready to welcome some new instruction, new guidance, new ideas to give them a fresh start. The fear of surrendering points has become mental as well as tactical and technical. Time to sweep bad habits away. Emery is picking up a team who just endured statistically Arsenal’s poorest season since the 1980s in terms of goals conceded. The new manager will presumably want to discuss some changes of personnel in that department as well as team approach. Individual errors have been prevalent. Shkodran Mustafi switches off, Laurent Koscielny’s achilles was a problem even before his serious injury and Per Mertesacker has retired. So Arsenal should be in the market for another experienced body. The goalkeeping situation and defensive midfield anchor are part of the bigger defensive picture too, and improvement there is also needed. The number of empty red seats that became a feature of last season set alarm bells ringing. For a worrying number of a fanbase that had already gone through a few years of the Wenger In/Wenger Out debate frustration segued into apathy. Paying for tickets and choosing not to attend sends out a stark message. Emery needs to galvanise the team and by extension excite the crowd. It will not be easy to unify a fractured support who were at times almost being pushed to take a binary position – either unconditionally supportive or critical – but a promising start will help.  Given a limited budget compared with some of the league’s more lavish spenders, raising extra money by selling an asset is a consideration. Ramsey has a year left on his deal. Özil signed an extension last year but is one of the players whose response to Emery’s new world order will be fascinating. With an upsurge of discipline expected, will he be out with a mystery illness quite so often? Midfield balance has been an issue for a while and the freedom that both Ramsey and Özil enjoy means tactical discipline is not their favourite thing.  Ivan Gazidis made a point of mentioning this as part of the job description for any candidate, to continue the old Arsène Wenger trick of developing rather than just buying talent. Wenger, in his final season, progressed Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Reiss Nelson, Joe Willock and Eddie Nketiah from the academy, and the young Greek defender Konstantinos Mavropanos made some bullish strides in his cluster of appearances towards the end of the campaign. A couple of slightly older players can improve with more meticulous coaching about positioning and decision making such as Héctor Bellerín and Rob Holding. Arsenal will hope Emery can push them on."

Paul Warne was happy as Rotherham’s fitness coach in November 2016, when he was persuaded to take over as manager, already the third of the season, to oversee their inevitable relegation from the Championship with some dignity. Not only did he manage that but after reluctantly accepting the role permanently, he has now taken them back at the first attempt, beating Shrewsbury 2-1 in the League One play-off final.“I’ll struggle to get a job as a fitness coach now,” Warne said afterwards. Not that promotion has entirely convinced him of his own abilities. “It was tough last year. I questioned myself no end of times. The chairman convinced me that I have the attributes to be a good manager. I still try to convince myself that most days.”The unlikely figure of Richard Wood was Rotherham’s hero, the captain and central defender scoring from two set‑pieces. The winner came in extra time, required after Alex Rodman had equalised Wood’s first‑half opener, a cruel blow to Paul Hurst and his Shrewsbury side.Tipped for relegation by many before the season started, Shrewsbury spent 200 days in the automatic promotion places before running out of steam and finding themselves in the play-offs. Objectively speaking this has been a brilliant season, but Hurst’s emotions afterwards were split. “My stomach’s telling me disappointment, my head’s telling me pride,” he said. “We wanted that fairytale ending but we didn’t get it.” Hurst has been linked with other jobs, and played a straight bat to those questions afterwards.Predictably the game started with the frantic energy of a six-year-old allowed outside after being locked in the house all day with a bottle of Ribena. Rotherham were awarded a penalty in the eighth minute, when Omar Beckles discovered putting Wood in a headlock was against the rules. David Ball stepped up but Dean Henderson, on loan from Manchester United and Shrewsbury’s best player on the day, dived right and saved.Beckles was lucky not to concede a second penalty for a virtually identical foul on the same player moments later. Perhaps he should have tried it again in the 32nd minute when Wood gave Rotherham the lead, rising above Beckles with brilliant purpose to head a Joe Newell corner down into the ground then up into the roof of the net. “I saw my kids crying in the stands,” Wood said afterwards. “That’s what it’s all about.”A moment of excellence totally out of step with their general performance drew Shrewsbury level after half-time. Shaun Whalley played a short free-kick from the edge of the area to Matt Sadler, he sharply flicked it to Rodman who jabbed home from six yards. It was as brilliant and smart as it was unexpected.Rotherham, hitherto so sparky, seemed to lose their momentum, and Shrewsbury could not press home their advantage: thus, for the remainder of normal time, the teams circled each other like tired boxers waiting for the other to throw the next punch.As the clock ticked down, weary limbs and minds in the baking heat would only allow sporadic bursts of attacking. Hurst, while not trying to make excuses, said it was “a bit of a farce, almost” that a whole season could come down to two shattered teams dragging themselves around Wembley. And it’s tough to argue with him.Both teams were so exhausted when extra time arrived that a mistake was inevitable, and it came in the 103rd minute. Newell skimmed a free-kick to the back post, and there was Wood again, entirely unmarked to toe-end the ball just – just – into the corner. “It’s the first time he’s scored twice in a week,” Warne said, when it was pointed out that Wood had never managed two before. “Including training. I call him ‘the wrecking ball’, because whenever the ball goes in the box he’s prepared to head people to get it in the goal.”The wrecking ball cleared a path for Rotherham to immediately return to the Championship, quite an achievement considering they went down last season with only 23 points. The reluctant manager will have to go on for a bit longer now."

Juventus captain Gianluigi Buffon is leaving the Italian champions and considering playing elsewhere.Buffon, who is widely regarded as one of the best goalkeepers of all time, was expected to announce his retirement at a news conference with Juventus president Andrea Agnelli at Allianz Stadium on Thursday.Instead, while the 40-year-old Buffon says the Serie A match against Verona on Saturday will be his last for Juventus, he has received offers to play elsewhere which have changed his mind about retiring.“[On] Saturday I will play a match and that is the only thing that’s certain,” Buffon said. “Until about two weeks ago, I was certain I would stop playing. Now offers have arrived that are exciting on and off the pitch and the most important for staying on the pitch was proposed to me by Agnelli. I’ll let these three days pass and then I will make a definitive decision, completely calmly.”Buffon, who made his debut with Parma in 1995, has been at Juventus since 2001 and he has ruled out moving to another Italian club or dropping down the divisions. “I am not someone who thinks it is right to end my career in who knows what third or fourth level division,” he added. “I am a competitive animal and I wouldn’t be able to live in that situation. I wouldn’t feel at ease.”Buffon retired from the national team in November when Italy lost a World Cup play-off to Sweden but recently returned for friendlies. He was an integral member of the Italy squad that won the 2006 World Cup. Buffon could bid the national team goodbye in a friendly on 4 June against the Netherlands.Buffon also used the press conference to apologise for offending English referee Michael Oliver with his behaviour during and after the dramatic Champions League quarter-final defeat to Real Madrid.The goalkeeper was sent off by Oliver after confronting the referee over a late penalty awarded to Real, and converted by Cristiano Ronaldo. Buffon is the subject of a Uefa misconduct charge for criticising Oliver following the tie, notably saying he had a “rubbish bin for a heart.” “It is obvious that I have transgressed and I am sorry,” Buffon said. “But it was a very special situation. I couldn’t do anything else but say those things and I am sorry to have offended the referee.” Uefa will deal with Buffon’s case on 31 May. "

Antonio Conte remained in a state of agitation. The Chelsea manager had seen Eden Hazard put his team in charge of the FA Cup final with a first-half penalty but he did not celebrate. Instead, he continued to chew the ear of the fourth official, Lee Mason. Conte wanted a red card to be shown to the Manchester United defender Phil Jones, for what he felt had been a last-man foul on Hazard.It seemed to sum up what has been a slog of a season for Conte – even at the good moments, he could have gripes. It has had the feel of one long argument between him and the club and there was the unmistakable end-of-era impression for him at Wembley.It was Conte’s swansong, the last game before his release or escape. How else could it be billed, given what has gone before? The key question was whether he could rise above the background noise to draw a performance from his players? The answer was yes. Just about.It was far from vintage and if Hazard was the match-winner who looked a class apart, particularly during the first-half, it was an occasion when Conte was more indebted to his match-savers.Conte’s decision to start with his first-choice goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, rather than Willy Caballero – who had featured in every previous round of the competition – was a declaration of intent and it yielded a dividend in the shape of three vital second-half saves. In front of Courtois, Antonio Rüdiger and Gary Cahill were immense while N’Golo Kanté was simply N’Golo Kanté.It was not pretty and José Mourinho sniped about Chelsea’s gameplan – high balls fired up to Olivier Giroud with Hazard foraging for the scraps – being predictable. Mourinho did not see any irony to his comment. But Chelsea did play with a defensive conviction and Conte will doubtless argue that they made their own luck, which was most pronounced when Paul Pogba blew a gilt-edged late header.There was a symmetry to Chelsea’s season of angst finishing here because it was in last season’s cup final that the faultlines had started to show. Back then, Conte’s team had failed to turn up against Arsenal and, in a game that saw Victor Moses sent off, they were well beaten.Diego Costa said afterwards that he only wanted to leave Chelsea for Atlético Madrid, not a team in China and since then the flashpoints have been numerous. There was Conte’s infamous text to Costa; the sale of Nemanja Matic to United; the recruitment issues; the deep freeze with David Luiz and other players. When Conte agreed to a new contract, it did not contain an extension.The Italian’s future has been a saga and in victory here he continued to posture, to send messages to the board. Back me or sack me was the subtext. It has long looked plain that the club are not inclined to do the former. But Conte could also luxuriate in a triumph that he felt spoke volumes for the mentality that he has instilled.It was always likely to be tight and what Conte wanted was for Hazard to unlock United. His formation was designed to create the platform for his talisman. Playing off Giroud, Hazard was absolved of defensive responsibility and encouraged to roam left and right.Conte’s wish was that Hazard could be isolated against Jones. It happened twice in the first half and, having worked David de Gea at his near post, Hazard made his mark. His balance and acceleration exposed Jones and when he made it into the area, the alarm bells sounded. Jones’s covering tackle was grimace‑inducing. Hazard’s conversion was nerveless.Conte did not leave his technical area and he did not stop waving his arms and barking his instructions. The final whistle brought an explosion of emotion and, after everything he and the club have been through, it was full of the good stuff. If this is to be the end, Conte has gone with a characteristic bang."
football,"• World Cup squad even completing walk from the halfway line• Pickford in duel with Butland and Pope for England No 1 jersey

Jordan Pickford has confirmed England are preparing for the possibility of facing penalties in Russia, even practising the nerve-jangling walk from the halfway line that has been the undoing of many players. The squad are alive to the possibility of a shootout in the knockout stages which has ended in heartbreak, almost without exception, at recent major tournaments. Gareth Southgate will always be haunted by his penalty miss against Germany that led to England’s elimination in the Euro 96 semi-finals.But Pickford, one of three goalkeepers in the squad, said they have been rehearsing. “We’ve been doing the walk from the halfway line,” he said. “We’re not looking too far ahead but behind the scenes we’re doing a lot of work to be prepared for how we’d want to go about it.“It’s pot luck sometimes. Sometimes you’ve just got to pick a side [to dive to], wait and attack that side. If you get there you get there and if you don’t, get the next one. It’s like a lottery. If you save a couple you can be a hero but there’s no pressure on you.”Despite Pickford’s belief that there is an element of good fortune involved in winning shootouts, Southgate is using the training camp at St George’s Park to address penalties. The manager is keen to emphasise it does not mean England have become complacent about progressing from a group containing Panama, Tunisia and Belgium. But the 47-year-old knows England have one of the worst shootout records in international football.They have lost six of seven competitive tournament shootouts beginning with Peter Shilton’s failure to get close to any of West Germany’s four efforts at Italia 90. Of the 36 penalties faced by five England goalkeepers at major tournaments, only David Seaman and Paul Robinson have saved one, with an additional four misses.Pickford was only 10 when England lost a shootout against Portugal at Euro 2004. David James did not get close to saving any of Portugal’s seven attempts, with the home side’s goalkeeper Ricardo stopping Darius Vassell’s effort before scoring a penalty himself to send the hosts through.Pickford is also open to the idea of taking a penalty if the situation arises. “If I need to step up, I’ll take one,” the 24-year-old said. “I’ve got no issue with that. I’ve never taken one in a shootout but I’m always practising in training.“I remember the Under-17s World Cup, I was down as third to take one. But the manager, John Peacock, changed it so I dropped to seventh and the lad who took the third penalty smashed it over the bar.”He has already experienced winning under Southgate, triumphing with the under-21s in the Toulon Tournament during 2016. The Everton goalkeeper is in a battle with Jack Butland and Nick Pope to be first choice after Southgate overlooked Joe Hart, despite him playing in nine of the 10 qualifying matches.The trio have only nine caps between them but Pickford insisted he is not concerned by the scale of the challenge or the uncertainty about who will be chosen. “Look at our experience in the Premier League,” he said. “I have played 38 games this season and numerous matches in cups and the Europa League. That is where you get your experience from. That’s why I have been to six or seven loan clubs from when I was 17 onwards, to become the best keeper I can.”Pickford has escaped the level of scrutiny his team-mate Raheem Sterling has been subjected to for his recent tattoo but the goalkeeper’s left arm is covered in artwork. He has “mam” and “dad” encased in love hearts surrounded by sketches of compasses and butterflies.His dad, a builder, used to drive him to training sessions as a child. In the back seat he would eat chicken and pasta, from a plastic container, prepared by his mum but during his time at Sunderland Pickford was publicly warned by David Moyes about his refuelling habits. In 2016 Moyes predicted Pickford would eventually be England’s No 1 but said he must sort out his eating habits, a criticism that still rankles.“He never said it to me, he just said it to the papers. It would have been nice if he’d come and said it to me,” Pickford said. “Sometimes off the field you learn the most, becoming a better person, and nutritionally, I’ve worked a lot on it. I’m flying and feel much lighter and [am] getting across the goal even quicker.“I think it was just portion sizes. I wasn’t going to McDonald’s every week but a nice pizza after three points isn’t a bad way to have it. We’d be having more than a pizza if we win the World Cup.”"
football,"• Midfielder says United have improved but can be better• ‘When you don’t win the next year is always more pressure’
Jamie Jackson at Wembley

Nemanja Matic believes Manchester United must make major signings this summer if they are to challenge for the Premier League and Champions League next season.United’s 1-0 defeat by Chelsea in Saturday’s FA Cup final meant they ended the campaign without a trophy. United also finished as runners-up in the Premier League, a record 19 points behind Manchester City. While second is their highest placing since claiming the title five years ago, there was further disappointment in the Champions League, with United knocked out in the last-16 stage by Sevilla.Matic is clear that United have to strengthen. “We need some players with experience to bring more qualities to our team,” the midfielder said. “After that, we can fight for the title and the Champions League also.”Matic also accepts the lack of silverware will put more pressure on United next season. “This is football,” he said. “When you don’t win one year the next year is always more pressure. When you play for Manchester United this is normal and we have to accept and deal with that.“We have improved. Last year United were sixth. The year before, fifth. So we improve, we are second. The only team who is better than us is Man City. They play amazing football. But we are second and in the Champions League next year, which is the most important thing.“When you win a trophy it’s different and you feel better but the most important thing is that we can look in the mirror and know we gave our best [against Chelsea]. The team was sad after the game – we know we deserved more – but this is football. It is a final, everything can happen, so we have to be focused on the next challenge.”Chelsea’s winner came via an Eden Hazard penalty that he won after Phil Jones was caught out of position and fouled the Belgian. “Everyone can make a mistake,” said Matic. “Sometimes I make mistakes, but this is football.“He worked for sure to do the best for the team – he always fights for the team. I can’t blame him because he gives 100%. He needs to forget and be focused on the next challenge.“Chelsea have some players that can punish every mistake like Hazard did so we have to accept, see where we can improve, and next year to try and win some trophies.“We played 90 minutes of good football. It was better in the second half but in the first we controlled the game but conceded a goal from one mistake.”José Mourinho did not send his players away with a message to contemplate during their break from club football – “We didn’t speak with him,” said Matic – and the manager is now on holiday, conscious that United’s prospects of closing the gap to City and going into the Champions League closing stages next year depend on the club’s business in the transfer window.Regarding the major signings Matic points to, Mourinho wants a right-back and a left-back to replace Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young, who are both converted wingers. Juventus’s Alex Sandro is thought to have overtaken Tottenham’s Danny Rose as Mourinho’s first choice for left-back and he wants an equally dynamic right-back to replace Valencia.The future of Anthony Martial remains in doubt, as his 13-minute cameo as a replacement against Chelsea underlined, so the manager is also targeting a new attacker. Ajax’s Justin Kluivert is one potential replacement. While 10 goals in 30 league games for a 19-year-old wide-forward is impressive, he lacks the experience Matic cites.Michael Carrick’s retirement – he is now a member of Mourinho’s coaching staff – and Marouane Fellaini’s potential departure will leave Mourinho with only Ander Herrera, Paul Pogba and Matic as frontline midfielders. Scott McTominay emerged this year but is 21 and has only 25 first-team appearances. Given the manager’s mistrust of Pogba, he may have to sign at least one midfielder.Mourinho would like to strengthen at centre-back, too – possibly freeing up a berth by selling Chris Smalling – but there are only so many high-grade signings possible in the window.Next season promises to be the defining one for Mourniho. As Young said: “We have to come back stronger – in the league, the FA Cup, the League Cup, the Champions League. We want to be fighting on all fronts.”"

Derby manager Gary Rowett speaks. I’m very happy with lots of things. We were a counterattacking threat all night which we worked on. Defensively, we were very well disciplined. Curtis Davies marshalled them very well. I was disappointed we didn’t pick them off for a second. The goal was the first time we showed a bit of composure. The goal comes from a bit of good play. We have given ourselves a fantastic opportunity.

Derby’s Cameron Jerome and Curtis Davies speak. CJ : “It’s a slight advantage. If you had offered it before we would have taken it. It’s going to be tough. They boys were magnificent from 1-11.”CD: “[On Mitrovic] He’s an in-form striker. We can’t defend for another 90 minutes down there..but it’s good to have a lead to take down there.”CJ: “Given chances you will score goals. The lads are finding me, thankfully. Curtis was magnificent tonight and the back 3-5 was brilliant.”CD: “They [Fulham] with Wolves are the best footballing side in the First Division Hopefully, we can make a couple of chances and win the tie.” 

9.39pm BST
21:39

There goes the final whistle. Derby, resolute and threatening. Fulham were disappointing and fragile.Updated
at 10.00pm BST


9.38pm BST
21:38

90 mins: Fulham are careless in the dying seconds, and give the ball away. Anya, though, cannot do much with it. There were no teammates ready to receive a cross. 

9.37pm BST
21:37

90 mins: Applause as Carson takes an age over a goal-kick. Derby fans trying to sing the nerves away. And their team is now dallying over throw-ins down the right-hand flank. 

9.36pm BST
21:36

90 mins: Plenty of pictures of fans biting nails, sucking thumbs and rocking on their heels. Agony for the home fans, and even worse for Fulham supporters, perhaps.

9.34pm BST
21:34

90 mins: There will be four added minutes, which seems maybe a minutes in excess, and the Derby fans are none too amused. 

9.34pm BST
21:34

89 mins: Derby sub: On comes Jamie Hanson for a limping Weimann. 

9.33pm BST
21:33

88 mins: Fulham step it up again. A dinked cross to Mitrovic, but the striker can’t keep his header down.

9.32pm BST
21:32

87 mins:  Sub: Oliver Norwood is on for Fulham, replacing Johansen.

9.31pm BST
21:31

87 mins: Cairney chance. In typical style, he ghosts into space, and his shot spinnakers towards goal. Carson was beaten, but so was the post. 

9.30pm BST
21:30

86 mins: And Bradley Johnson booked too, for Derby, for a tactical foul as Fulham looked to be breaking.

9.29pm BST
21:29

85 mins: Johansen booked for Fulham.

9.28pm BST
21:28

84 mins: Weimann on the break, falls over at exactly the wrong moment. Derby were close to being through and Weimann, who slipped on the ball, looks to have hurt himself. 

9.27pm BST
21:27

82 mins: Kebano is getting involved, and been more prominent than Sessegnon, but still, Fulham, who have scored in every game in 2018, look incapable of carving out chances. Mitrovic forces a corner.

9.25pm BST
21:25

81 mins: Derby fans are giving it the big one. “Super Derby, super Rams” and their team has been pretty heroic so far, though the lack of a second goal will only add anxiety. 

9.24pm BST
21:24

79 mins: Not sure those subs have had the desired effect for Fulham. Suddenly, their attack looks even more lacking in cohesion. For Derby, Anya and Nugent have been effective in releasing the pressure.

9.22pm BST
21:22

77 mins: Fulham pile it on, but Derby have reclaimed something of their early poise in defence and throw a wet blanket over the danger. 

9.21pm BST
21:21

76 mins: First booking: Weimann for clattering Kebano and then protesting too much. 

9.20pm BST
21:20

75 mins: Better signs for Derby, even better signs when Sessegnon and Ayite leave the field for Piazon and Kebano. Sessegnon, the EFL Player of the Year no less, was negligible. 

9.19pm BST
21:19

74 mins: Odoi has to take evasive action. Lawrence again gets space, and Nugent was lurking with intent. Another Derby corner comes to nothing when a whistle is blown for an infringement. 

9.17pm BST
21:17

72 mins: Tom Lawrence gets to the byline, and his ball arrows into the six-yard box. Anya cannot reach it. Would a centre-forward like Vydra or Jerome have done better? 

9.16pm BST
21:16

71 mins: Tom Huddlestone opens up Fulham with a long pass. Anya forces a corner. It went to the back post but Bradley Johnson was penalised for some shoving.

9.14pm BST
21:14

70 mins: The stats suggest that for the last 10 minutes 55% of the action has been in Derby’s final third. They are holding firm. But only just. 

9.13pm BST
21:13

69 mins: Targett overlaps and nods down for Mitrovic, but he overbalances and the ball ends up squirting behind the goalline. The ball not quite dropping for Fulham.Updated
at 9.26pm BST


9.12pm BST
21:12

68 mins: Derby subs: off come Jerome and Vydra, while on come David Nugent and Ikechi Anya. 

9.11pm BST
21:11

66 mins: Fulham ratcheting it up. Derby going last-ditch. But pressure is relieved when Mitrovic can’t keep the ball in.

9.09pm BST
21:09

64 mins: Mitrovic attempted to slalom through but Davies denied him again. It is, though, getting ragged for Derby. 

9.07pm BST
21:07

63 mins: Cairney at last surges forward from midfield. A fierce shot but straight at Carson. 

9.07pm BST
21:07

62 mins: Long, hopeful ball from Vydra, and Bettinelli came out to the edge of the centre circle to deny Jerome. He had to since Odoi was dithering, but this was as foolhardy as it was brave.

9.05pm BST
21:05

60 mins: At such a point, do players begin to think of their clubs’ poor record in the play-offs? Possibly not the best course of action for these specialists in play-off failure. 

9.04pm BST
21:04

59 mins:  This is opening up now. Mitrovic denied that time but becoming ever more prevalent. 

9.02pm BST
21:02

57 mins: Fulham are known for late goals, and it looks as if half-time has leadened Derby’s legs. That said, Lawrence found space, but the ball up to him from Weimann had been any use, that could have been 2-0. Neither team have shown the attacking precision they will find in the Premier League. Updated
at 9.03pm BST


9.00pm BST
21:00

55 mins: Now a chance for Weimann at the other end. Looped ball over and the Austrian gets a shooting chance. Fredericks, though, was in the right position to put him off. The angle was also far too acute. 

8.59pm BST
20:59

54 mins: Another great Fulham chance! Long, diagonal ball from Johansen finds Ayite clear on goal but he can’ keep his shot down.

8.57pm BST
20:57

53 mins: Fulham rattle the bar! Mitrovic holds the ball up and McDonald smashes it. Carson was beaten. Updated

football,"The right-back was unknown, uncapped and unemployed before scoring two monstrous goals – but his fairytale became a cautionary tale

In the summer of 1964, England took part in the Little World Cup in Brazil. It was a simple four-team league involving Portugal, Argentina and the hosts. England finished joint-bottom with Portugal. In their first match they were plugged 5-1 by Brazil in Rio. They commiserated with a night on the town, and were staggering around Copacabana beach the following morning when they were challenged to a game by some local kids.It was an embarrassing mismatch: the England team, two years away from winning the Big World Cup, got absolutely slaughtered for the third time in 18 hours. Admittedly it was 12 v seven, and the seven had quaffed a few performance-diminishing substances the night before. But the story, told in Jimmy Greaves’s Don’t Shoot the Manager, reflects an eternal truth about Brazilian football: that there are brilliant, natural talents on every beach corner.The ultimate symbol of that is Josimar, the two-hit wonder of Mexico 86. No World Cup has ever produced a better collection of goals – if you do only one thing with your lunch break today – and Josimar scored two monsters against Northern Ireland and Poland. He might as well have come straight out of the thin Mexican air. Nobody outside Brazil had heard of him; he wasn’t even in the Panini album.He wasn’t just unknown – he was also uncapped and unemployed when he was called up to the Brazil squad at the last minute after the first-choice right-back Leandro pulled out. Four players missed a curfew but only one, the playboy winger Renato Gaúcho, was thrown out of the squad by the manager Telê Santana. Leandro, whose head was a mess at the time, pulled out in a kind of guilty solidarity.Josimar had not played a game since mid-March, when his Botafogo contract expired. He was cooking and looking after his pregnant wife when he received a call telling him he was going to Mexico. In the best traditions, he thought it was a joke, politely said thank you and got on with his day. An hour later he received another call telling him where and when to report.Édson Boaro, the back-up for Leandro who was now first choice, got injured after 10 minutes of the second match against Algeria. Josimar was not on the bench but he did replace Edson in the starting line-up against Northern Ireland six days later. He was strikingly tall for a full-back and formidably built, with a sinewy frame and thighs made of oak.Brazil were 1-0 up with four minutes to go to half-time, keeping the ball with some lazy passing in Northern Ireland’s half. “Josimar … Júnior … Elzo … Alemao,” said BBC commentator John Motson, capturing the rhythmic groove of Brazil’s possession as Alemão played the ball square to Josimar. “Well, Careca and Casagrande are waiting for a cross.”They’re still waiting. Josimar pushed the ball in front of him, sprinted on the spot in excitement at what he was about to attempt, and put his whole being into a shot. It was a ridiculous distance from which to shoot - 30 yards out and a long way to the right of centre – but the ball swooshed wickedly and arrowed past Pat Jennings into the far top corner.The celebration was almost as iconic as the goal. Josimar went off on a mini lap of honour, both arms raised in the air, his face a picture of giddy disbelief. Years later, Jennings was asked by a small boy at a Q&A what it was like to be chipped by Josimar from 35 yards. “Son,” he said. “Your idea of a chip and my idea of a chip are two different things!”For a full-back, a goal like that is a once-in-a-lifetime moment. So Josimar did it again four days later, rampaging through the Poland defence to batter the ball home from an absurd angle. It was the second goal in a 4-0 win that took Brazil into the quarter-finals, where they lost to France on penalties after a classic 1-1 draw.Even though he only played three games, Josimar was included in Fifa’s team of the tournament, the only Brazilian apart from the centre-back Júlio César to make the XI. Botafogo re-signed him, and the media adopted him. “UM HERÓI DESEMPREGADO” (THE UNEMPLOYED HERO) was the headline of a feature in Placar. He also won an informal award as the most beautiful player of the tournament. “I’m just like coffee,” he said. “The ‘blackie’ that satisfies everyone.”The fairytale soon became a cautionary tale. Josimar, like so many Brazilian footballers from poor backgrounds, was allergic to overnight fame. His life was tipped downside up and he surrendered to a hat-trick of vices: booze (especially whisky), cocaine and womanising. Soon after Mexico, he started to make different kinds of headlines. He ended up in prison after hitting a prostitute who racially abused him when he tried to negotiate a cheaper price for an orgy that had already happened. A few years later, he threw his wallet out of the window when being chased by police; it was later found with three grams of coke in it. His brother, a cocaine addict, was also shot dead in a favela.Josimar was one of the first bad boys of Brazilian football, a status that rankled. “Maradona and Edmundo were given second chances,” he said in a 1995 interview. “Why not me? Nobody ever proved anything against me. I only liked a bit of whisky.”Many sportsmen never recover from their lowest point; Josimar never really got over the high of Mexico and his career drifted to nothing. In 1988 he almost went to Dundee United (the mind boggles at the thought of the relationship between Josimar and Jim McLean) and he was offered to Alex Ferguson at Manchester United (the mind boggles, etc) before having a shambolic spell at Sevilla. He did play a significant part in Botafogo’s legendary Campeonato Carioca victory in 1989, and was a bit-part player in Brazil’s victorious Copa América squad a month later. He won the last of his 16 caps in November 1989. Those two goals in Mexico were the only ones he scored for Brazil.Josimar eventually found his way back on the rails with the help of the great right-back Jorginho. He embraced Christianity and now lives in the north of Brazil. He is still bitter about all the racism, the fake friends and his treatment in the press. His recent interviews suggest the internal tug-of-war between denial and regret is unresolved. He is more fondly remembered abroad than in Brazil, where he is a curiosity in the national team’s lavish history. The rest of the world only really saw Josimar at Mexico 86 and then in the greatest theatre of all, the imagination. We assumed he was roofing 30-yarders every week. If the World Cup is our dream holiday, once every four years, then Josimar was a helluva of a holiday romance. Globalisation, the internet and Football Manager have long since stripped football of its mystery. Josimar is a joyful lament for the past. His name – and what a name, by the way – evokes the innocence of ignorance, before the internet bred know-it-alls in more ways than one.There was a mythical quality to Josimar’s goals. You would see them once in a blue moon – on a grainy home-made VHS that you had lovingly labelled ‘DON’T TAPE OVER’, perhaps, or if Grandstand had a feature on great long-range goals. YouTube has changed our memories of our memories, and probably softened some of the Proustian magic of his goals. But his association is as powerful as ever.Norway’s best football magazine is called Josimar; there’s even a Scottish graphic designer who named his business after his Brazilian muse. Along with Salvatore Schillaci at Italia 90, Josimar is surely football’s greatest one-tournament wonder.He is also often included in the list of lost talents. If anything he was the opposite, a good but not great player whose brief career peak was perfectly in sync with the apex of football’s four-year cycle. Brazil has millions of talented unknowns, sure – but few left a mark on the football world like Josimar.With thanks to Eduardo Pagnoncelli and David Tryhorn."

Brazil’s right-back Dani Alves will miss the World Cup. The Brazilian Football Confederation has confirmed in a statement his knee injury makes it “impossible to call Dani Alves for the period of preparation, friendlies and, consequently, the World Cup.”The 35-year-old was injured on Tuesday in the French Cup final while playing for the winners, Paris Saint-Germain.The injury will sideline him for at least three weeks. Brazil’s first game in Russia will be on 17 June against Switzerland. Alves played in the previous two World Cups and has 107 appearances for the team since his 2006 debut.Neymar, meanwhile, has admitted he still has fears over missing the World Cup due to the broken right foot he suffered in March.In an interview published on Friday, the Brazil and Paris Saint-Germain striker said treatment has worked “but there is always that fear of it [the injury] coming back”.“I need to lose that fear as quickly as possible to arrive at the World Cup at my best,” Neymar said in an interview on Zico’s YouTube channel. “In the beginning we are hesitant about making the complete movement.”"

Not everyone is lucky enough to have a team to support at the World Cup this summer. Only 32 of Fifa’s 211 members are off to Russia, with the five most populated countries in the world – China, India, USA, Indonesia and Pakistan – all missing out. Fans from right across the globe will be picking alternative teams to follow so, with this in mind, we’d like to know who you will be cheering for and against.If you’re looking for a team to support, the two newbies, Panama and Iceland, are natural choices. They are very different places but both are exotic in their own ways: did you know that Iceland has no forests whereas Panama is the only county in the world to have a rainforest within the city limits of its capital?Egypt, Senegal or Brazil may be a natural fit for Liverpool fans. Peru, one of the 13 countries who took part in the first World Cup in 1930, would welcome your support after 36 years of missing out on the finals.

Jürgen Klopp believes Liverpool’s bravery, work-rate and desire for a sixth European Cup can compensate for Real Madrid’s greater experience when the sides meet in the Champions League final. Saturday’s contest in Kiev will be Real’s fourth Champions League final in five years, with Zinedine Zidane’s holders aiming to lift the trophy for a third consecutive season. No club has won a hat-trick of European Cups since Bayern Munich in 1974, 75 and 76.Liverpool’s recent European record pales by comparison but having reached a first final in 11 years with several exhilarating performances and scored a competition record 40 goals en route, their manager is confident his team’s virtues can prove decisive in Ukraine.Klopp refused to be drawn on whether Real should be favourites but said: “They are more experienced, that is a fact. If there is a market for experience they should sell it because then they would be even richer. Experience is very important in life but it is not the only thing. It is important to be more experienced but youcan level it with desire, attitude, work-rate and that is what I love in football. We made our own experience.“We are not as long together as Real Madrid because they play these finals pretty much with the same team so as a group they are very strong. That is all fact, but it is still football and we have a chance and let’s give it a try. Let’s go there and try to perform on a level which maybe people would say is not possible for us but it is possible.”Klopp added: “We did all the things we need to do plenty of times already in the Champions League campaign and now we need to do it again. Real Madrid is a really good football team but we are a really good football team. We are full of desire and we really work for our dreams.”The Liverpool manager expects his team to play without fear against Real having thrived on the pressure of reaching the final and next season’s Champions League on the last day of the Premier League season with an injury-hit squad. He also cited brave attacking displays against Manchester City and Roma in the quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively as reason to approach Kiev with optimism.Klopp added: “We had a lot of pressure and a lot of expectations in the last few weeks. Each game we drew we wanted to win. I said all that rubbish after West Bromwich Albion only because I was really angry we didn’t win. I am not a psychologist but if somebody would tell me constantly that everything is different in the next game then I would get nervous.“We have to handle it like an opportunity because it is an opportunity. You cannot go into a football game knowing you can lose it. I experienced that plenty of times but I am still a happy person. Life goes on. We will show the players why it makes so much sense to be brave. It was not easy to be brave against Manchester City and against Roma but we did it. The moment we tried to defend the result we were almost out. I am in a good mood. I am really looking forward to the game. Unlike the Brighton one, I would buy a 1-0. This game I really want to play.”Long-term absentees Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joël Matip were the only senior players missing from training on Monday as Liverpool stepped up preparations for Kiev while Emre Can, along with Adam Lallana, significantly increases Klopp’s midfield options for the final.“The mood is very good for the club, for us and for the boys because we finished the season in the best way,” said the manager.“We felt really good and then having time to prepare for the game is really good. We could do a lot of things and didn’t have to compress it into two or three sessions.“We could do a lot of things in training. We have three more sessions and then we will be best prepared for the game. We feel good and think we deserve to be where we are because the boys showed up in the campaign.“It was very exciting and now we want to bring it to the best possible end.”"
football,"Goalkeepers are transferred for less and paid less. Is it time football finally valued them relative to outfield players?
Sean Ingle

Mon 14 May 2018 11.30 BST

So arrivederci then, Gianluigi Buffon. Assuming there is no careering handbrake turn away from retirement, the match against Verona on Sunday will prove his last. It seems vaguely astonishing that he made his debut in 1995 – a teenage action hero clad in pink and black for Parma, fearlessly facing down George Weah, Roberto Baggio and the rest of Milan’s all-stars. Nearly 900 games later, he will hang up his Puma One Grips having averaged a trophy for each year of his career.And along with a World Cup, Uefa Cup, five Italian Cups, six Italian Super Cups, a European Under-21 title and multiple Scudetti, Buffon holds another honour. For he remains the only keeper in the 50 biggest transfers in history according to Transfermarkt (which tracks deals in Euros) – even though his €52m move to Juventus took place 17 years ago.Back in 2001 that price seemed crazy. Now it looks like one of the bargains of the century. Yet few clubs have dared follow the Old Lady’s lead. Incredibly, Transfermarkt lists only 11 keepers who have cost more than €15m (£13.2m). In a world where Theo Walcott and Guido Carrillo both cost £20m that seems bizarre. But according to Nick Harris’s excellent Sporting Intelligence website it illustrates a wider trend. His numbers show that keepers are also paid less than defenders, midfielders and strikers – and have become less valued relative to outfield players too.In the 2005-06 season, for instance, Premier League keepers were paid £533,000 on average – 79% of the average basic annual salary of all players, which came to £676,000. By 2016-17, keepers in first-team squads earned £1.68m on average – only 69% of the average Premier League basic salary of £2.4m.It seems obvious that some keepers are massively undervalued. The question is can we prove it?Ted Knutson, who worked on player recruitment at Brentford and the Danish club FC Midtjylland and heads the football consultancy StatsBomb, believes so. As he explained during a presentation at South Bank University last week, keepers are often harder to evaluate than other positions. They need to sweep up, distribute the ball accurately and start attacks as well as keep clean sheets. Yet the data isn’t always there to properly assess their strengths and weaknesses.Save percentage, for instance, matters little if every shot goes down a keeper’s throat. And while looking at how a keeper performs compared with the expected goals (xG) they are predicted to concede is more robust, it doesn’t take into account defensive pressure or the power of a shot.Knutson recalled a chat with Bob Bradley, the former coach of Swansea, while interviewing him for the Midtjylland manager’s job. While amenable to using data, Bradley pointed out an obvious flaw with xG. “You can’t tell me that if I have two men on a guy having a header from six yards out that is a good chance,” he said. “I know for a fact it is a very hard to score.”Knutson conceded he had a point. “But I have to look across 30 leagues across the world to find undervalued players,” he replied. “And I cannot duplicate your eyes across 20,000 players and multiple seasons.”Now, however, Knutson believes he has a more reliable way of assessing chances and keepers. A key breakthrough is that the velocity of every Premier League shot can now be tracked (unsurprisingly Riyad Mahrez and Harry Kane lead the way in attempts from distance) – and his data also shows the exact position of each player when the ball was hit, and whether the keeper was moving, set, or on the ground.This gives the scout or analyst a wealth of information. It means they can assess a keeper’s reaction time; how good their positioning is compared with other keepers across multiple leagues; and, ultimately, how good their saves are. It could, suggested Knutson, be a game changer.Using this data, his StatsBomb colleague Derrick Yam then ranked keepers in the Premier League in 2017-18. Unsurprisingly David de Gea was right up there, conceding eight goals fewer than an average keeper would based on the shots he has faced. Arsenal’s Petr Cech ranked last, having conceded six goals more than expected (Liverpool’s Simon Mignolet was not far behind).We all know De Gea is far better than Cech. Yet having such numbers gives us a much better idea of their respective worth. As Knutson says: “Conceding eight goals less a year than average is a massive amount. Flip it around and say an average striker scores 10 goals a year and is worth £20m. Depending on age and other factors, an extra eight league goals could make a striker three times as valuable.”And if De Gea’s exceptional performances are repeatable across multiple seasons – and the evidence suggests they are – he and other top young keepers should be worth a minimum of £50m or £60m.Longevity should be another factor in their favour. We know that players decline physically as they wade into their 30s. Yet keepers appear to cast off their powers at a slower rate, and what they lose in reactions they often make up for by reading the game better.Certainly no one at Juventus will be counting the cost of signing Buffon all those years ago. Especially after he paraded a seventh successive Scudetto in front of an adoring Curva Sud Scirea on Sunday."

One photograph encapsulated Florian Thauvin’s time at Newcastle. It captures him, cheeks plump and sleek, a Louis Vuitton washbag clasped in his right hand, walking through a sunlit St James’ Park. His hair is impeccably swept back, he is wearing a bow tie and a slight smirk – he is clearly aware of the camera – gives his face an unfortunately smug aspect. Just behind him is a sign: “Please keep off the grass.”Thauvin was sadly obedient. He started only three games in 2015‑16, his one season on Tyneside. He had cost £15m, plus the season-long loan of Rémy Cabella and came to embody everything that was wrong with Steve McClaren’s side. He was overpaid, overhyped and overindulged, an indictment of the policy of recruiting in Ligue 1 that had been lauded.When Chancel Mbemba had turned up in black tie in August, it had provoked amusement. Thauvin’s decision to repeat the stunt a month later, drew only scorn, not helped by the fact he went on to lose possession 33 times during the game. “He turns up in a tux!” Alan Shearer moaned on Match of the Day. “This is a serious business we’re in here. It was funny on the first day of the season. It’s not funny any more.”Thauvin’s protestations that he had not been the only one wearing a bow tie and that Shearer’s criticism had damaged his confidence did not help the impression he was cut out for the extremely serious business of playing for Newcastle. In 13 desultory league appearances, he managed neither a goal nor an assist. He had one shot on target.He returned to Marseille and was sent off against Montpellier on his second debut for them. At that point, it was hard to argue against the former France goalkeeper Jean-Paul Bertrand-Demanes’s comment, after he had abandoned Lille for Marseille without playing a game for them, that he “had chickpeas for brains”.Under Rudi García, Thauvin, now 25, is living up to the promise he showed at Bastia. He has scored 22 goals in Ligue 1 for Marseille this season and set up a further 11. His role on the left of a 4‑2‑3‑1 will be vital if they are to defeat Atlético Madrid on Wednesday and become the first French club to win the Europa League. Against Atlético’s narrow 4‑4‑2, his spark from wide, against a full-back in Lucas Hernández, who can seem a little clumsy, is the most likely means for Marseille to trouble their more experienced opponents.Thauvin is important not just for his stats or the specifics of this game. He is somehow representative of Marseille as a whole, as a club who give players another chance. For two decades they have seemed a club in limbo, cursed by their illustrious past into expectations that outstrip their resources.For clubs a tier or two below the superclubs, there are not many options. Marseille went the eccentric genius route with Marcelo Bielsa in 2014-15 and although they glimpsed glory, they suffered some dismal refereeing in a vital game against PSG and then the late-season fatigue that has so often undermined the Argentinian’s sides.The loss of André-Pierre Gignac, Dmitri Payet and André Ayew that summer effectively undermined any hope of a second challenge and Bielsa quit one game into the season. Marseille slumped to 13th and there were further departures that summer.But then the US businessman Frank McCourt bought the club and with the finances stable Marseille began a more traditional programme of rebuilding. They are not a superclub, far from it, but they had the resources to begin patching a side together from misfits and malcontents.Thauvin has been the most striking success but on the other flank is Lucas Ocampos, who arrived at Monaco from River Plate as an 18-year-old in 2012. He never came close to living up to expectations and has spent his career in Europe shuttling between Monaco and Marseille, while being loaned to Genoa and Milan. Finally settled he has begun to thrive, scoring nine league goals and a further four in the Europa League this season.Between the two wingers is Payet, a player who seems always to be either scoring brilliant free-kicks or sulking, with not a whole lot of grey area in between. His form suddenly has improved in the past month and there is talk, once again, of him forcing his way into the France squad.Marseille are littered with Premier League rejects – Jordan Amavi, Steve Mandanda, Clinton N’Jie, Kostas Mitroglou – while the centre-forward Valère Germain was the forgotten man of Monaco’s run to the Champions League semi-finals last year.There is something absurd in thinking of the 10-times French champions, the 1993 European champions, as underdogs, but that is the reality of football’s modern economics. Their progress may not be sustained but their quilt of players who have fallen through the cracks at least offers hope there is life beyond the elite."
football,"Jürgen Klopp’s inspirational reaction to losing the 2016 Europa League final convinced Henderson they would be ready next time

The mood in the Liverpool team hotel was understandably bleak following defeat by Sevilla in the 2016 Europa League final. Players were allowed to drink but there was little conversation flowing that night in Basel until Jürgen Klopp, at the end of his first season as manager, addressed the squad. “It felt shit three hours ago and it still feels shit now,” he began. “But we will be back.” It was the defiance behind those prophetic words that made the greatest impression on Jordan Henderson.Klopp launched into a hoarse version of “We Are Liverpool” once his rallying call was over. It was a stoic effort considering he had just suffered a fifth consecutive cup final defeat but, to Liverpool’s captain, there was a confidence born in Klopp that night that has underpinned progress to Saturday’s Champions League final against Real Madrid. It is the belief that next time, this time, Liverpool will be ready.“It was the worst feeling ever,” recalls Henderson, an unused substitute against Sevilla having damaged knee ligaments in the quarter-final at Borussia Dortmund. “I remember after the game the manager was obviously down but when we got back to the hotel he had something different about him. He was proud of the players that got to the final and how much we had improved since he came in. He had, I felt, a vision that in the future we would get to another final.“He was obviously disappointed with the result but he looked at the bigger picture and the future and he felt it could be a big moment in our careers if we learned from the experience. He had something about him that made you feel it was the start of something, that there was something he could take forward and use to get the team to another final. And, if we got to another final, we’d be ready.”There is another thread through Liverpool’s Champions League campaign that can be traced back to Basel. After that 3-1 defeat Klopp claimed his team had “lost faith in our style of play”. Throughout the thrilling advance on Kiev it has become the manager’s mantra that Liverpool must be brave, and it was the quality he identified as key to victory over Manchester City and Roma. The message will no doubt be repeated before Real Madrid but it is already embedded in his players.“Real Madrid are a team of winners,” Henderson says. “Individually they have world-class players all over the pitch. They find a way to win and that’s what the best teams do. That’s what we have to do at the weekend, just keep doing what we have been doing through the campaign. We’ve been brilliant. On the day we have to be brave and play like we know we can. If we do that, we can hurt them.”Henderson will become the fifth man in Liverpool’s history to lift the European Cup should Klopp’s side halt the holders’ quest for a third consecutive Champions League. The 27-year-old may be understated compared with Emlyn Hughes, Phil Thompson, Graeme Souness and Steven Gerrard but he shares the single-mindedness that enabled his predecessors to reach the summit of European football.As he says: “Beating City was an amazing feeling but the most important thing is that we haven’t won anything yet and that is what you are judged on as a team. In 20, 30 years’ time people will look back and say Liverpool won the European Cup in 2018, not that they qualified for the semi or the final. The biggest thing for us is to go that one step further and win.“You never know what will happen in football. I hope there are a lot more opportunities in the next few years for us because I feel we are good enough, we have a world-class manager and we are going in the right direction. But this is our first final in a while and getting over that first hurdle as a team and winning the Champions League would be a massive step. The belief we would get can really put us in a good position over the next couple of years for the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup.”Henderson has been in close contact with the family of Sean Cox since the 53-year-old was attacked by rival fans before the semi-final first leg with Roma. Cox remains in hospital almost a month after the incident with a brain injury and the midfielder, who held aloft a banner paying tribute to the Irishman in Rome, says the whole squad has been affected.“When you hear that someone is seriously hurt and in a coma it does hurt us as players because he just wanted to watch a game of football and support us,” Henderson says. “Sean supports us and it is important for us to support him and his family in a tough time. As captain you have a responsibility to get in touch with the family. I felt in the second leg that the players had him in the back of their minds and we used that to perform for him and his family.”"

The United States men’s national team had always planned on using their May camp to prepare for the World Cup, but looking ahead to Qatar 2022 surely wasn’t what they had in mind. Fine-tuning has instead given way to long-range planning as one of the youngest USA squads in recent memory takes on Bolivia in a friendly on Monday night outside Philadelphia before flying to Dublin to face Ireland on Saturday, then to Lyon to serve as a sparring partner to France in their final tune-up before the big to-do kicks off in Moscow.No doubt the Americans would rather be the knife than the flintstone in the equation, but they only have themselves to blame after the team’s embarrassing failure to qualify for next month’s tournament, leaving them on the outside of a World Cup looking in for the first time since the Reagan administration, with only the 2022 cycle to look toward.The shirts on the Talen Energy Stadium pitch will be the same but many of the players wearing them will be familiar only to hardcore supporters. Team linchpin Christian Pulisic (20 international appearances), Joe Corona (20), Jorge Villafaña (16) and Eric Lichaj (14) all featured in the side’s doomed qualifying campaign, but the other 18 players named to Monday’s squad have collectively been capped a scant 51 times. Fifteen of them are aged 22 or under, while only Villafaña and Lichaj were born before 1990. And since not all of the players dressing for Bolivia will make the trip to Europe – Major League Soccer clubs are not required to release their players for international duty since the matches don’t fall on Fifa dates – there’s a chance for even more fresh faces to enter the mix. The USA have played three times under stopgap helmsman Dave Sarachan since the Catastrophe at Couva, earning draws with Portugal and Bosnia, and seeing off Paraguay in friendlies. A dispiriting sense of purgatory will linger until the team appoints a permanent manager, but the business at hand demands increasing the depth of the player pool and assessing the youngsters who will be in their prime years when the US makes their redemptive run for Qatar. “As I’ve talked about throughout this process, the theme is to offer opportunity to this younger generation of talented players that have potential down the road with the program,” Sarachan said. “We’ve had first-time call-ups in every camp since November, and this is another extension of that. We’re going into the Bolivia game with newer faces along with a few familiar players as well. Overall, these types of games provide great chances for players to bank key minutes in international matches.”Long-term planning seldom makes for a sexy narrative and Monday’s match with La Verde hardly qualifies as appointment viewing for the casual fan, but a few plotlines stick out. Pulisic and Weston McKennie, the Bundesliga midfielders and longtime friends coming off promising campaigns with Dortmund and Schalke 04 respectively, will likely start beside one another for the first time as senior internationals, a partnership that could blossom into something special in coming years. Toronto FC’s Alex Bono and Midtjylland’s Bill Hamid will likely see time in the ongoing hunt for a first-choice goalkeeper with Brad Guzan and Tim Howard almost certainly out of the international picture. Forward Jordan Sargent, an 18-year-old who signed a contract with Werder Bremen last year and is eligible to debut for the first team next season, is expected to make his USA debut, as could defensive midfielder Keaton Parks, a 20-year-old Texan who made four appearances for Benfica this year while punching in seven goals for the reserves.The United States’ next possible World Cup match – and this is the best-case scenario – will take place four years from now during Thanksgiving week in the middle of a desert. They won’t take place in a tournament until next summer’s Gold Cup. The time for tearing up the floorboards and building from scratch will never be riper. The future is now, if depressingly ahead of schedule."

There are more than a few concerns before next month’s World Cup in Russia: the threat of hooliganism, the country’s patchy record on LGBT rights, and the prospect of Russia playing Vladimir Putin at centre-forward. For officials at Argentina’s Football Association (AFA), however, the most pressing issue appears to be how to talk to women.On Tuesday, the AFA held a course for players, staff and journalists about what to expect when they travel to Russia. Among the materials was a manual entitled Russian Language and Culture, which included a chapter on “What to do to have a chance with a Russian girl”. Anyone wanting a chance with a Russian man was left to figure things out for themselves.Setting aside the obvious dubious morals of the whole exercise, it turns out that the manual’s author, Eduardo Pennisi, believes Russian women have the same standards as pretty much everyone else on Earth. Apparently, they like people who are “clean” and smell “good”.El curso fue hoy en la AFA. Tengo el cuaderno. Nos lo sacaron para cortar esa hoja pero yo la guardé cuando supuse lo que harían. pic.twitter.com/gBeG9xWsWZIn another stunning revelation, Russian women like to be treated as human beings. “Russian girls do not like to feel like objects,” reads a passage from the manual, translated into English by Deadspin. “Many men, because Russian women are beautiful, only want to take them to bed. Maybe they want it too, but they are people who want to feel important and unique. The advice is to treat the women who is in front of you with their own ideas and wishes. Pay attention to their values and personality. Don’t ask stupid questions about sex.”Additionally, Pennisi advises Argentinian men to avoid printing out their bank statement on a first date. “Maybe you try to impress her by talking about the money you have, that you know everything, that you are perfect and the others are poor stupid people,” reads the manual. “In the end, if the girl has a little sense, she will bounce you. Be real and talk about you in real terms, talk about your faults in a fun way and about your positive points.”The AFA soon realised they had made a mistake and issued a statement on Wednesday. “After an internal investigation in respect to yesterday’s events during the Russian Language and Culture course, it has been concluded that the materials distributed were incorrectly printed,” read the statement.“The teacher in charge of the course chose information to give the assistants but regretfully at the moment of printing, because of an unforeseen error a text that was never part of the course was included. The administrative personnel of the department proceeded to remove it immediately. We regret that the error would have obscured the importance of the day’s lesson and the permanent educational activities given by AFA, and expressing our sincerest apologies to those affected by the publication, which in no way reflects the thoughts of the Argentine Football Association or its president Claudio Tapia or any of of his directions.”Pennisi does not offer any advice on whether or not Lionel Messi should play in the false nine role at the World Cup."

News that Peru fans have been protesting in the streets against the doping ban imposed on the country’s captain, Paolo Guerrero, has got the Fiver looking forward to some thrilling attacking football from the South American side and wondering again about a vengeful marsupial. We may be extrapolating too much from the precedent set by Peru’s 1970 campaign but you knew the risks when you signed up for this guff. And the fact is that 1970 was Peru’s most successful World Cup and it, too, was preceded by popular rage against a perceived injustice – and followed by a curious incident of an opossum and denied time.In the qualifiers for the 1970 tournament Peru lost 2-1 to Bolivia in circumstances that led to the referee becoming a marked man down Lima way. The Venezuelan whistler disallowed one Peruvian goal, sent off two Peruvian players and detonated the golden age of Peruvian swearing, with new terms invented at a rate of 73 per minute just to pour scorn on the official. Even though Peru overcame that defeat and went on to play dazzling attacking football all the way to the quarter-finals, some folks remained embittered enough to smile when they read three years later about a Venezuelan cup match between Aragua and Portugesa that ended in mayhem as the same referee was accused of blowing for full-time five minutes early, leading to furious Aragua players hitting him with fists and feet and, in the case of goalkeeper Dario Castillo, reportedly with a black-eared opossum that happened to be passing.Now, the Fiver is not suggesting English referees should be thankful they aren’t good enough to have been selected for this summer’s Ethics World Cup or that there is any chance of marsupials being deployed as weapons in Russia. We’re just noting that there are good and bad ways of channelling anger and Peru seemed to get it right in 1970. Aragua, not so much.All of which brings us back to Guerrero, who is likely to miss the Ethics World Cup after the court of arbitration for sport ruled on Monday that his ban for testing positive for the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine should be extended from six to 14 months. Cas accepted the player did not seek to gain an advantage but maintained he should have been more careful, disappointing the player who had explained: “I had an anise tea in Peru because I had indigestion, and I had black tea with lemon and honey in Argentina because I had the flu. I don’t blame anyone, but the substance could have been in a jar or a cup.” Indeed, the player’s lawyers suggested there’s no way of knowing for sure when the substance invaded their client’s system, noting that remnants linger for ages if traces found in three perfectly preserved 16th century Inca mummies discovered in 1999 are anything to go by. That cut no ice with Cas, apparently.Peruvians have mobilised to persuade Fifa otherwise, as have the captains of France, Denmark and Australia. “We believe that in the interest of fairness and proportionality (…) Paolo who — as everyone agrees did not cheat — should be able to participate with, and against, his fellow professionals in the [Ethics] World Cup,” wrote Hugo Lloris, Simon Kjaer and

Guerrero even met this week with Fifa overlord Gianni Infatino – to little effect. “The Fifa president stressed the fact that the sanction had been imposed by the court of arbitration for sport, after an appeal lodged against a decision of an independent Fifa judicial body,” a Fifa wonk wibbled.In happier news, Fifa also announced this week that all of Russia’s players are clear to play at the tournament after an investigation into anti-doping violations found “insufficient evidence” of any cheating by anyone in the hosts’ squad.“We have consulted with different experts and we decided to take actions that, to our understanding, will not prejudice Márquez” – The Mexican Soccer Federation explain that defender Rafael Márquez will train in a strip featuring no sponsors in case a training kit emblazoned with logos somehow affects a US Treasury Department investigation into him for alleged drugs trafficking.

Steve Bruce speaks: “We had to defend very well. We went too deep in the second half. But the resilience! The second half was very difficult but we kept a clean sheet, we’ve got an advantage, coming to Middlesbrough’s never easy, so we’ll take that and look forward to Tuesday. It’s a small advantage. It’s half time. They’ve got to come to our place, but we all know the Championship, how ridiculous it is!”

The seven-time champions of England take a precious lead back to Villa Park for the second leg on Tuesday!Updated
at 7.21pm BST


7.09pm BST
19:09

90 min +6: Traore skips in from the left, but can’t fashion space to shoot. That allows Grealish to scamper up the other end, eating up what’s left of the clock.

7.08pm BST
19:08

90 min +5: Well that’s all the added time used up, but with Terry having gone down seeking treatment, there’s more!

7.07pm BST
19:07

90 min +4: ... Terry goes down holding his neep. The referee blows up, as he has to for a head injury. The Boro fans don’t like this one either, assuming he’s trying it on. You know how these things go.

7.06pm BST
19:06

90 min +3: A chance! The ball’s sent into the Villa box, and breaks to Fabio on the penalty spot. He slashes a shot towards the bottom right. It’s deflected out for a corner, from which ...

7.05pm BST
19:05

90 min +2: Downing attempts a shot from 25 yards. Bloody hell.

7.03pm BST
19:03

90 min +1: Boro have all the possession ... but it’s in the middle of the park. There’s no way through Villa.

7.02pm BST
19:02

90 min: There will be five minutes of added time.

7.02pm BST
19:02

89 min: Whelan comes on for Elmohamady. Downing immediately romps into space vacated by the left-back. He crosses. Bamford eyebrows the ball on. It drops to Friend, who waits for an age for the ball to drop - then smashes it high into the stand. Too much time to think.

7.00pm BST
19:00

87 min: Elmohamady looks to have pulled a hamstring. He’s holding the back of his right leg, grimacing, having pulled up abruptly in a chase with Fabio. Or is it cramp? The Boro fans think he’s trying it on, with a view to running down the clock. He gets some treatment on the pitch, before limping off.

6.58pm BST
18:58

85 min: Traore skedaddles down the left and loops inside for Bamford, but Terry steps in to clear. Boro have total territorial dominance right now ... but Villa are holding firm.

6.57pm BST
18:57

84 min: Fabio has been busy since coming on. He earns a bit of space on the right, and sends a screamer of a ball through the six-yard box. Johnstone deals with it well.

6.56pm BST
18:56

83 min: Jedinak clears that second one. Both sets of fans are feeling the tension at a nervous Riverside: the next ten minutes or so are crucial to the balance of this semi-final.Updated
at 6.59pm BST


6.55pm BST
18:55

82 min: Bamford and Howson one-two down the left, forcing Terry to intercept and concede a corner. The set piece is met by Fabio, on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. Johnstone is forced to turn the ball round for another corner.

6.53pm BST
18:53

81 min: Grabban has been quiet. He’s replaced by Bjarnason.

6.52pm BST
18:52

80 min: Boro desperately need something to happen. But they’re up against it now. Villa have only conceded six goals in the last 15 minutes of all their matches in all competitions all season!

6.50pm BST
18:50

78 min: Traore turns on the jets and races past Snodgrass, who isn’t risking anything now he’s been booked. He earns a corner, from which Friend is penalised for grappling with Terry.Updated
at 7.13pm BST


6.50pm BST
18:50

77 min: Downing lifts the free kick into the mixer. It hits Gibson, and harmlessly bounces through to Johnstone.

6.49pm BST
18:49

76 min: Snodgrass is booked for a fairly cynical check on Friend. It’ll be a free kick just to the left of the Villa box. But before it can be taken, on comes Bamford for the disappointing Assombalonga. Bamford’s arrival is met with great cheers.

6.47pm BST
18:47

75 min: Grealish dribbles with great intent down the middle of the park. He’s a very fine player to watch in full flight. He slips the ball to his left for Grabban, who sidefoots a lame first-time effort into Randolph’s arms from the edge of the box.

6.46pm BST
18:46

73 min: Howson crosses from the Boro left. Grabban volleys to the halfway line. Villa seem happy enough to let Boro come onto them, because they’re doing very little in the final third, and this scoreline will be more than acceptable for Bruce’s side going into the second leg.

6.44pm BST
18:44

72 min: Another cross by Fabio from the right, and again it’s easily snaffled by Johnstone.

6.43pm BST
18:43

71 min: Adomah is replaced by Kodjia. Formerly of Boro, the Villa man receives some warm applause as he departs.

6.42pm BST
18:42

69 min: Fabio crosses deep from the right. Johnstone rises to claim the ball, while Terry eases Assombalonga out of the road underneath. Boro make a half-arsed claim for a penalty, but that’s never going to happen.

6.40pm BST
18:40

68 min: A free kick for Boro out on the left and a chance to load the box. Which they do, but it’s a futile effort, because Besic blooters a wild free kick over everyone and out for a goal kick.

6.40pm BST
18:40

66 min: Howson and Besic one-two crisply down the middle of the park. It’s a lovely move, and Besic then slips the ball wide right for Fabio, who bursts into the box. Fabio might as well shoot, really, because there’s nobody bar the heavily marked Assombalonga in the middle, but he doesn’t fancy the tight angle and cuts it back instead. To nobody.

6.38pm BST
18:38

65 min: Ayala is replaced by Fabio. That was preposterous, really, it was obvious even to a quack watching on television that the player was in pain. I have no idea why Boro sent him back onto the field.

6.37pm BST
18:37

64 min: Ayala takes up possession 30 yards from his own goal. He’s in obvious distress, and it’s all he can do to swivel and hoick the ball straight out of play, lest he make some sort of dreadful mistake. He can’t put any weight on his leg.

6.35pm BST
18:35

62 min: He’s trying to continue, but it doesn’t look good. He grimaces in pain as he steps back onto the field, and immediately looks back to the bench with sad eyes. But for now, he limps on.

6.34pm BST
18:34

61 min: Ayala has injured himself in the process of stopping Grealish in his tracks. He’s hurt his knee, and looks in a lot of pain. For a second it looks like he won’t be able to continue, but eventually gets up, limps off, and is given a talking-to by Pulis on the sideline. He’ll try to continue.

6.33pm BST
18:33

59 min: Traore over-elaborates 30 yards from his own goal. He loses possession to Grealish, who should send a shot goalwards, but doesn’t. Ayala blocks him. Grabban has a whack as the ball runs loose, but Traore deals with that one. A rare second-half attack for Villa, and a let-off for Boro.

6.30pm BST
18:30

57 min: It comes to nothing. Boro have enjoyed the lion’s share of possession since the restart, but Villa look pretty comfortable. 

6.29pm BST
18:29

56 min: Traore spins Hutton down the left. Hutton tries to drag him back. The whistle goes for a free kick, though as Traore had continued to run at, and get the better of, Snodgrass, Boro aren’t happy. Still, a set piece in Villa’s final third.

6.27pm BST
18:27

54 min: Boro continue to push Villa back. Downing shimmies along the right and wins a corner. He takes it himself, long. Ayala tries to guide a header goalwards, but it’s bundled clear. Besic probes down the right and curls towards the near post, where Shotton bundles out for a goal kick.

6.25pm BST
18:25

52 min: Howson runs at the Villa back line with great intent. It’s a determined run which gets the visitors looking concerned for the first time since the restart, but when he lays off to Besic, the thrust of the move dies. The ball’s recycled, but Villa have regrouped, and Assombalonga drags a fairly lame shot wide left from distance.Updated
at 6.53pm BST


6.23pm BST
18:23

50 min: Traore bursts down the left, a fine run for a while, but it ends sadly with a heavy touch that forces him out of play for a goal kick. The Riverside is a bit subdued for the first time this evening.

6.21pm BST
18:21

49 min: Gibson is booked for a fairly agricultural lunge on Jedinak. He doesn’t bother complaining.

6.21pm BST
18:21

48 min: But otherwise, it’s been a slow start to the second half. Grealish tries to spark it into life with a run down the left, but he’s ushered out of play by Besic.

6.19pm BST
18:19

46 min: Friend immediately tears down the left wing. He goes nowhere, but that was hectic enough to suggest Mr Pulis has given his team a bit of a talking-to during the break.

6.17pm BST
18:17

And we’re off again! Middlesbrough get the party underway again, albeit after a false restart. No half-time changes. “Play offs should come with a government health warning,” writes the nanny state’s Simon McMahon. “After watching Dundee United bottle it at Livingston last night, was at Cowdenbeath, aka the Blue Brazil, today to see them preserve their league status with a crazy 3-2 victory over Cove Rangers. Shakespeare couldn’t script what happens in the play offs, and there’s more drama to come for sure.”

6.11pm BST
18:11

Half-time reading. There’s been some other meaningful end-of-season action today. In the League One play-offs, Scunthorpe forced a dramatic late draw with Rotherham. Meanwhile Tranmere Rovers are back in the Football League, despite having been reduced to ten men after a first-minute sending off in the National League promotion final against Boreham Wood. Barry Glendenning was at Wembley for that one.

6.03pm BST
18:03

And that’s that for the second half. Villa have the advantage thanks to Jedinak’s header; they’d be in total control had Randolph not made that wonder save from Snodgrass. Boro need something in the second half, or they’ll have a hell of a task turning this round at Villa Park.

6.02pm BST
18:02

45 min +1: Friend is booked for an out-of-control run and leap into Jedinak. That seemed a bit of an unnecessary and pointless challenge.Updated
at 6.02pm BST


6.01pm BST
18:01

45 min: Traore dribbles in from the left and looks for the top-right corner of the Villa net. Not quite.

6.01pm BST
18:01

44 min: And then Snodgrass drops a shoulder to cut in from the right, curling towards the top left. It’s a wonderful shot, but Randolph stretches out and fingertips it onto the left-hand post. The ball rebounds away to safety. What a shot ... and an even better save! Happy birthday to the Boro keeper, then, 31 years old today. 

5.59pm BST
17:59

43 min: Hourihane tries to release Adomah down the left. Ayala should tidy up, but he hesitates after intercepting and that allows Adomah to pick the ball up and consider a shot. He doesn’t have a go, but Villa stay on the attack, pressing Boro back.

5.57pm BST
17:57

41 min: Traore sees a shot from distance deflected out for a corner. Ayala flashes a header on target from the set piece, but Johnstone gathers. Good luck predicting who’ll score next, because both teams are doing their damndest.

5.55pm BST
17:55

39 min: Grealish embarks on another Gazza-style run, this time down the middle of the park from the halfway line. It’s a gravity-defying dribble, as he rides a couple of barges, and it showcases plenty of ball-glued-to-toe skill ... but the minute he enters the area, he’s blocked by Ayala before he can get a shot away. What a stunning run, though.

5.54pm BST
17:54

37 min: A cross curled into the Villa box from the left by Friend. Assombalonga stoops at the near post and tries to guide a header into the bottom left, but Johnstone drops to smother. Assombalonga has had three decent chances in the last six minutes. He should have done better with all of them.

5.53pm BST
17:53

36 min: Besic tees up Adam Clayton, 25 yards out. The ball sails off into the blood-red sky.

5.51pm BST
17:51

35 min: The first slight lull of the match. It’s been otherwise thoroughly entertaining, despite the high stakes, so let’s give the lads a break, they deserve it."

These are difficult times for Sam Allardyce, who is not only aware of the speculation that suggests he may be preparing an Everton side for the last time but readying his tough exterior for the possibility that he might be jeered by both sets of supporters at the London Stadium on Sunday, writes Paul Wilson.The former West Ham manager has waited in vain for public backing from Everton’s owner that he will be allowed to see out the second year of his contract, with the result that while other managers are looking forward to a break he is waiting to discover whether he gets the thumbs up or thumbs down from Farhad Moshiri.“No date has been set for a meeting yet but there will have to be one,” Allardyce said. “I’m looking forward to it because there is a lot to be discussed this summer. No disrespect to what the squad has done this season but if we want to finish higher up the table we need to go to the market.“You can’t magic something overnight when you walk into a struggling club, you can’t wave a magic wand and say we’re going to play like Manchester City.“I am being criticised for the style of football but there’s nothing wrong with our style of play because it suits the players. If people want better results and more attractive football then we are going to have to get better players.“I think we are improving, there were games in my early days here when we sometimes only had one shot on target at home, but when you come into a club you have to work with the players that are available. We are better now than we were in January, and that is because we went out and bought a couple of players to help us score more goals.”"

Arsène Wenger is convinced that a seismic change to the game is afoot and that the coming years will witness the inception of a European Super League. The outgoing Arsenal manager believes it will take over from the Premier League at weekends, with domestic matches being played in midweek. One of the knock-on effects would be a reduction in the number of teams in the Premier League.Wenger, who is impeccably connected at Fifa and Uefa, described the change as “inevitable” because the big clubs will no longer want to share broadcast revenues with the smaller ones, whom fewer fans are keen to watch.He claimed that audiences were down for midweek Champions League ties and a move to glamour European fixtures at weekends under a new format would be attractive. Elite-level clubs in mainland Europe, he added, would be receptive to the Super League because it would enable them to attack the financial dominance of the Premier League.“Maybe I will see you in a few years and you will certainly have a European league over the weekends,” Wenger said. “A domestic league will certainly play Tuesday/Wednesday. It will happen and it will be soon because it is a way for other clubs to fight against the Premier League.“Why at weekends? Because the Champions League doesn’t sell well anymore. Look at the audiences of the Champions League. There’s a contrast there because if you look at the audiences of the Champions League, it is not fantastic. But if you have Real v Barca or Real v Arsenal or Manchester United v Bayern Munich every week, the audiences will be good.“It is inevitable. Why? First of all, to share money between the big clubs and small clubs will become a problem. Why? Because the big clubs will say that if two smaller clubs are playing each other nobody wants to watch it. People want to watch quality. The big clubs say: ‘So we have to share the money but nobody is interested in you?’“The Premier League will get smaller. If you want to make it more attractive, you have to go down to 16 and make a real competition of it. But it will be smaller if it goes to Europe.”Wenger was in unusually reflective mood as he prepared for the final match of his 22-year Arsenal tenure at Huddersfield Town on Sunday. He said the years after the club’s move to the Emirates Stadium in 2006, when he had to manage with restricted budgets, were his most challenging and when he did his finest work.“I would say, personally, from 2006 to 2015 – it was certainly the period where I needed to be the strongest and did my best job,” he said."

Crystal Palace look set to offer Wilfried Zaha a new contract after his performances helped secure the club Premier League football for a sixth successive season.The Ivory Coast forward enjoyed his most productive campaign yet as Palace recovered from losing their first seven matches to finish 11th after hiring Roy Hodgson as manager. Zaha scored nine goals in 29 appearances, having been sidelined for two separate spells in August and March, with Palace failing to record a single victory in the nine games he missed.The 25-year-old signed a new five-year deal last summer worth around £110,000 a week and has repeatedly stated that he is happy at his boyhood club. However, with Chelsea, Tottenham and Liverpool having all shown an interest in recent weeks, Palace will attempt to ward them off by rewarding their star player with an improved deal that would see him become the top earner at the club ahead of the Belgium striker Christian Benteke.It is understood that Manchester City had also previously shown an interest in Zaha, although that has cooled recently as they pursue other targets. Tottenham’s manager Mauricio Pochettino is long-time admirer of the player, while Chelsea’s interest is complicated by uncertainty surrounding the future of the manager Antonio Conte. Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp is also believed to have monitored Zaha but now appears likely to press ahead with attempts to sign France’s Nabil Fekir from Lyon instead.The out of contract trio Bakary Sako, Yohan Cabaye and Joel Ward, meanwhile, are close to signing new contracts at Selhurst Park on reduced terms after talks with their respective representatives. Sako, who moved to south London from Wolves in 2015, fractured an ankle in January having played an important role for Hodgson’s side as back-up to Zaha, while the former France midfielder Cabaye had been linked with a return to Ligue 1 with Marseille.It is also understood that Palace are unlikely to pursue their interest in the France Under-20 goalkeeper Alban Lafont in this window despite scouting him extensively last season due to the impeding arrival of Vicente Guaita from Getafe on a free transfer."

Jack Wilshere and Joe Hart have been omitted from England’s squad for this summer’s World Cup but there is a place in Gareth Southgate’s selection for Fabian Delph.Wilshere has missed out after being called up for the friendlies against Italy and the Netherlands in March only to withdraw because of injury. The Arsenal midfielder, who has not played for his country since Euro 2016, started only 12 Premier League games in the season just finished and a historically fragile body may have counted against him given the demands of a tournament.In leaving out Hart, Southgate has chosen to ignore his most experienced player. The Manchester City goalkeeper, who has spent the season on loan at West Ham, was told on Monday in a phone-call from the England manager that he would not be travelling to a fifth major finals despite Southgate having considered the 31-year-old his first choice for much of his tenure. Hart won his 75th and most recent cap against Brazil in November but Jordan Pickford and Jack Butland started the friendlies in March and have usurped him in the pecking order.The suggestion had been Hart would still travel to the World Cup as an experienced third-choice – only Gary Cahill and Jermain Defoe of Southgate’s recent selections have more than 50 caps, with neither expected to make the cut for Russia – and would have been willing to fulfil that role, but his toils at club level appear to have counted against him.He has endured an indifferent spell on-loan at West Ham this season, losing his place towards the end of November to Adrián and starting only 19 league games in total. He regained his place after a 4-1 defeat at Swansea in March, but there were subsequent high-profile errors against Burnley and Stoke. His last appearance was a 4-1 defeat at Arsenal on 22 April.Burnley’s Nick Pope, who was called up for the games against the Netherlands and Italy but remains uncapped, is the likeliest to replace Hart in the 23-man squad, which Southgate will reveal on Wednesday.Delph’s inclusion follows a season in which he has been successfully remodelled as a left-back at City by Pep Guardiola. The 28-year-old has been more naturally a central midfielder and brings versatility to Southgate’s squad. The left-back Ryan Bertrand has been left out but Ashley Young will be part of the squad.The Burnley defender James Tarkowski, who has one cap, is understood to be on the standby list. Southgate is expected to select Phil Jones, John Stones and Harry Maguire as centre-backs, with Kyle Walker and Eric Dier also capable of playing there."

Motherwell would be wasting their time should they apply a conventional approach in seeking to halt Celtic’s making of history. The last time a side – Rangers, in this instance – entered the Scottish Cup final looking to become the first to claim back-to-back domestic trebles, Dundee United’s approach under the eccentric Ivan Golac bore fruit.“On the Friday night in our hotel, BBC showed the scene and it was a party atmosphere,” recalls Craig Brewster, who scored the only goal of that 1994 final. “We travelled from Dundee on the Thursday afternoon and trained at a school on the Friday morning; we had to get taxis there and back. We were in a leisure centre at lunchtime where I met the captain of East Kilbride golf club, who invited me up to their driving range in the afternoon. It was scorching hot; some of the boys went to Hamilton races.”Motherwell, who travelled to their Turnberry base on Friday, will be denied such unorthodox ways but they can pull upon episodes such as that from 24 years ago. At the time, Rangers were as dominant in Scotland as Celtic are now. It should be recognised that a clean sweep of domestic honours is a tougher task than many would suggest but that no club has done it in successive seasons – taking into account the Old Firm’s dominance – is remarkable.Celtic are looking to continue an epic journey of success under Brendan Rodgers by lifting the Scottish Cup, thereby entering territory even the genuinely great Scottish club teams could not reach. Motherwell have won the Scottish Cup only twice, the last time being 1991.“A good thing for us probably was Rangers won the league about six weeks before the end of the season,” Brewster says. “That probably stopped their momentum. And on our day we were a good team; we were just inconsistent. United had been in six Scottish Cup finals and never won so that had to change sometime. I scored early in the second half then Guido van de Kamp made a brilliant save from Oleksiy Mykhaylychenko and I thought: ‘This could be our day.’”Celtic’s pain in similar circumstances was inflicted in 1970. There was an intense rivalry between Jock Stein, the Glasgow club’s iconic manager, and Eddie Turnbull, who was every bit as extroverted as Golac. Turnbull, earlier a legendary forward at Hibernian, took great delight in being the Aberdeen manager as Celtic were defeated 3-1. Celtic, with more than a degree of legitimacy, pointed towards refereeing interventions as their historic quest was abruptly halted.“By the time you get to the end of the season, the sheer number of games gets to your legs,” says Jim Craig, who won 14 honours with Celtic between 1965 and 1972. “I don’t think the mental aspect [of a treble] bothers them too much – it certainly didn’t with my generation. What does bother them is you can have a niggling injury from December that isn’t bad enough to stop them playing but can impact on pace, stamina or turning ability.”It seems incredible now but Celtic played that Scottish Cup final in between European Cup semi-final legs against Leeds. Craig admits Stein’s players “raised their game” for the meetings with the English champions; they duly won. Celtic lost the European Cup final to Feyenoord. “Our best days were three-quarters of the way through that season rather than at the end,” Craig says.Quite understandably, those from Craig’s era bristle slightly at the notion of Celtic in their current form being equal in status to the champions of Europe in 1967. Last season Rodgers presided over an unbeaten domestic season, another first. “There is no point in comparison,” says Craig.“One team won a European Cup and one hasn’t, so far. So why bother comparing? If you check the tables between 1966 and 1974, we very seldom were too far ahead. It was pretty tight, pretty close, most of the time. I don’t think you can say that of today but I must stress teams can only play what they are up against. Celtic look like they are going to do back‑to‑back trebles and nobody has done that before so good on them.”Rodgers has been careful to laud Stein and avoid making his own case for what consecutive trebles would mean for his reputation. It is hardly stretching things to suggest Rodgers might be negatively affecting perceptions by making the Scottish landscape appear too much of a formality.“All you ever want is an opportunity and we have given ourselves that opportunity,” says the Celtic manager. “Great teams, managers and players have been up here and for it to have not been done in the history of what is a wonderful football county tells you the magnitude of it.”Rodgers must already be looking at the broader picture. Qualification for the Champions League twice in as many attempts has boosted Celtic’s balance sheet considerably but the on-field picture has been less appealing. Next season Celtic must make more of an impact against continental opposition to endorse their manager’s impressive work in Scotland.“I want to inspire the supporters,” Rodgers says. He can take that as a given; indelible marks in the history books do no harm, though."

Swansea City are resigned to losing Alfie Mawson and Lukasz Fabianski and have informed both players, who have expressed a desire to return to the Premier League, they will not stand in their way provided their valuation is met.Mawson is attracting interest from Premier League clubs, including West Ham and Southampton, and is expected to command a £20m fee. That valuation would almost certainly have been higher if Mawson had represented England when he was called into Gareth Southgate’s squad in March, or if Swansea had retained their Premier League status and been in a stronger position to fend off offers for the central defender.Although Tottenham Hotspur have been linked with Mawson, there is no indication Mauricio Pochettino is interested in signing the 24-year-old, even if Toby Alderweireld ends up moving on. Mawson, who has just had minor knee surgery that rules out any possibility of him being in the England World Cup squad, joined Swansea from Barnsley for £5m in August 2016.Fabianski was Swansea’s best player by a distance this season and it is understood Watford, Newcastle, Crystal Palace and West Ham are monitoring the Poland goalkeeper’s situation. The 33-year-old, who joined Swansea on a free from Arsenal in 2014 and has 12 months left on his contract, is likely to be available for about £5m. Although there has been interest from top-six clubs keen on bringing in an experienced and reliable No 2, Fabianski wants to be a first-choice goalkeeper.Swansea are preparing to turn their attention to the pursuit of a new manager, with Carlos Carvalhal’s departure expected to be confirmed within the next couple of days. Graham Potter, who has enjoyed spectacular success with the Swedish club Ostersund, is a leading candidate, with Swansea focusing on bringing in a young and ambitious coach to re-energise a club that has badly lost its way."

The first half of 2018 has been one of the unhappiest chapters in Steve Bruce’s personal life but, professionally at least, the horizon is brightening a little for Aston Villa’s manager. Mourning the deaths of his father in February and his mother at the start of this month, Bruce looks shattered, yet he remains grimly committed to achieving the fifth promotion of a long-running coaching career.Mile Jedinak’s first-half header from an early corner puts him well on course to reach a milestone he had, until fairly recently, hoped to celebrate with his parents, and leaves Tony Pulis’s Middlesbrough up against it in the second leg at Villa Park on Tuesday night.“We’re pleased,” said Bruce, who had an impressively inventive central midfield performance from Jack Grealish to thank for helping outwit Boro. “We’ve given ourselves a little advantage, although we’re only winning 1-0 at half-time and strange things can happen. But we’ve handled the pressure of a big game here very well.”Given that the away-goals rule does not apply in the play-offs, it was not a total disaster for Pulis – although the set of his face suggested it felt like it. “We’re very disappointed, I think we did enough not to lose,” he said. “But it’s small margins – and it’s still all to play for.”Under Pulis’s tutelage, Boro have increasingly prided themselves on a growing proficiency at defending dead balls, so it must have hurt when they swiftly fell behind to the simplest of set-piece goals.It began with Albert Adomah, a Riverside old boy, winning a corner dispatched by Grealish. Some slapdash marking, most notably at the far post, enabled Jedinak to dodge a woefully flat-footed Ryan Shotton and direct an angled header past a wrong-footed Darren Randolph. As Villa fans celebrated manically, Bruce looked as if he could hardly believe his luck and Pulis’s players seemed downright stunned.Boro took a little while to recover from the shock and, with Grealish given far too much room to dictate the play, they were fortunate not to fall further behind when Robert Snodgrass headed Adomah’s cross fractionally over the bar.Gradually though, the Teessiders pulled themselves together, creating three decent first-half chances for Britt Assombalonga. While the first two were shot narrowly off target, the third, created by Adama Traoré, saw Assombalonga – controversially preferred to the initially benched Patrick Bamford as the lone striker – dodge John Terry before heading straight at Sam Johnstone when he really should have scored.Shortly afterwards, Pulis had Randolph to thank for somehow finger-tipping Snodgrass’s subtle curler from outside the area on to a post. It was a glorious drop of the shoulder and a technically accomplished shot on the winger’s part, and the save was even better.Like Snodgrass, Traoré has frequently shone this season but although the spring-heeled right winger sporadically had the beating of Alan Hutton, he persistently snatched at the ball.Traoré was understandably keen to impress against Villa, the club which imported him from Barcelona but swiftly part-exchanged him for Adomah, but some wild shots and miscued passes indicated he was perhaps trying too hard.Attempting to shift the balance of power, Pulis switched him to the left at the start of second half in a clear attempt to ruffle Villa’s right-back Ahmed Elmohamady. Wise to the ploy, Bruce immediately ordered Hutton to swap sides with the Egyptian.While Traoré had menacing moments, the veteran Hutton – deputising for Villa’s hamstrung first choice left-back Neil Taylor – did far better than most full-backs against Boro’s prize possession, frequently negating his advances. “Alan was immense,” said Bruce. “He’s out of contract this summer but we’ve worked all week on him stopping Traoré and it’s worked.”With Pulis arguably waiting too long before introducing Bamford, Boro enjoyed plenty of possession yet lacked a final ball clever enough to undermine the formidable efficiency of Terry and James Chester.Although Villa’s centre-halves ultimately dropped dangerously deep at times, the taut expression fixed on Boro’s owner Steve Gibson’s face as he sat, arms folded, in the directors’ box, emphasised the sense of a semi-final slipping away from his club’s grasp."

“Atlético Madrid’s win against Marseille in the Europa League final means eight of the last nine major European finals have been won by Spanish teams – and Real Madrid could make that nine out of 10,” begins Claire Miller. “Has one country ever dominated European football like this before?”The Premier League marketing department may have trademarked the phrase “best league in the world”, but not even they have the brass neck to claim it is the strongest. La Liga has dominated European competition throughout the 2000s, and especially in the last five years.Since the 2012-13 season, when Bayern Munich and Chelsea won the Champions League and Europa League respectively, it has been almost all La Liga. Real Madrid have won three of the last four Champions Leagues, with Barcelona winning the other in 2015. Sevilla won three consecutive Europa Leagues from 2014, while Atlético beat Marseille last week. The only non-Spanish team to win a European trophy in that time is Manchester United, who put Ajax to sleep in last year’s Europa League final.There have been some other periods of dominance in the 53 years of European competition. For this purpose we have included the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, as it was effectively the Uefa Cup by another name. But we’re not giving time of day to the Super Cup or Intertoto Cup, for obvious reasons.If Real Madrid win on Saturday, it will be Spain’s fifth consecutive Champions League. It would be quite a feat given that, before that streak started in 2014, no country – never mind a team – had retained the title since Milan/Italy in 1990.Five consecutive wins would be one short of the record: English clubs won six consecutive European Cups from 1977-82, and seven out of eight from 1977-84. They were less dominant overall, though, with only two more Uefa Cups in that time: Ipswich in 1981 and Spurs in 1984. Spanish clubs won the first seven European trophies – five consecutive European Cups for Real Madrid from 1956-60, plus two Fairs Cups for Barcelona. In those days there was no Cup Winners’ Cup, and the Fairs Cup was staggered over a number of seasons. Barcelona won the 1955-58 and 1958-60 titles.England had a very good spell from 1968-71, winning seven out of 12 competitions. Manchester United won the European Cup, Manchester City and Chelsea the Cup Winners’ Cup, and Leeds, Newcastle, Arsenal and Leeds, again, claimed the Fairs Cup.Yes, yes, we’re going to get to the golden age of Serie A. In the 1988-89 and 1989-90 seasons, Italian clubs won five of six European trophies, and in the last 11 seasons of the 20th century they won 15 out of 33. That included six Uefa Cup wins in seven years. In those days, when only one team from each country went into the Champions League, the Uefa Cup was the best guide of a league’s overall health. The number of trophies per country from 1988-89 to 1998-99 shows the extent of Serie A’s dominance:The Cup Winners’ Cup was abolished in 1999 and, since the turn of the century, La Liga clubs have dominated European football to a spectacular extent.Spanish clubs are so damn hot right now. We’ve been through the history books – we did a spreadsheet and everything – and there is no precedent for clubs from one country winning eight out of nine European trophies. Liverpool are not just taking on Real Madrid on Saturday; they are taking on the empire of La Liga.In last week’s Knowledge we looked at teams who hit the woodwork four, five or six times in the same match. Aaron Grierson can go one better …“In 2001, the Honduras national team took on Trinidad & Tobago in the final round of Concacaf World Cup qualifying – the hexagon,” writes Aaron. “A win would have probably sent Honduras through to the World Cup for the first time since 1982. They hit the post seven times, but unfortunately never found the back of the net. Stern John scored the only goal as Trinidad won 1-0. The Hondurans had to wait until 2010 to qualify for their second World Cup.”Meanwhile, Jacek Staszak has a not-strictly-relevant-but-still-interesting story to tell. “In November 2013 in Polish Ekstraklasa, Cracovia’s Vladimir Boljević alone hit the woodwork four times. He also managed to score, but the goal was ruled out because the assistant waved his flag. It wasn’t Boljević’s night, because the replays showed he was onside. If he had more luck, he would have saved his team from an embarrassing defeat, because Cracovia lost at home to Lech Poznań 1-6.”“In light of Real Madrid’s sacking of Fabio Capello, are there any other managers who have been sacked after winning the league title twice by the same club?” enquired Gordon Tait in 2007.Madrid actually only swung the axe at poor Fabio’s head on one occasion, Gordon; on the other, in 1997, he left the Bernabéu for Milan of his own accord. However, Vicente del Bosque has effectively been sacked by the club twice: first, during a short tenure as manager in 1994 and then, infamously, in 2003 when the club decided not to renew his contract even though he had just led the club to their second La Liga title in three seasons. He had also, somewhat shabbily, won two Champions League crowns in his four years in charge.Even before Del Bosque, Madrid had form for severing the hand that feeds them: in 1998, they sacked German coach Jupp Heynckes after just one season – a season in which Real won the European Cup for the first time in 32 years. Heynckes paid the price for some relatively miserable domestic form – Real finished fourth in La Liga, although they actually lost fewer games than the champions Barcelona – and was gone within eight days of the 1-0 victory over Juventus.However, surely the hardest-done-by manager in history was the Bayern Munich boss Udo Lattek, also sacked by his paymasters on two occasions. “In 1975, after he had won three German championships in a row and the European Cup, a Bayern side full of tired World Cup winners only finished 10th in the league,” recalled Raphael Honigstein. “Legend has it he then told club president Wilhelm Neudecker that ‘things have to change’, only to receive the reply: ‘Yes, they have to: you’re fired!’ He was reappointed in 1983 and again won three German championships and two cups in four seasons. But the European Cup final defeat in 1987 exposed a fraught relationship with his players. The club ultimately blamed him for the 2-1 loss against Porto and he was sacked. Again.”• Take a trip to the font of nerdvana in our archive@TheKnowledge_GU A couple for next week: Has any national side taken two keepers from the same club to a tournament?

Saturday’s Champions League final in Kiev promises to be that rare event, a meeting of outstanding teams that lives up to its billing, though the television trailer advertising that the contestants have 17 European Cups between them is economical with the truth.The figure is correct; it is just that Liverpool’s total of five is dwarfed by the Spanish club’s dozen. Not many teams can make Liverpool feel inferior in Europe but Real Madrid can. The current holders of the trophy have a habit of making everyone feel inferior. No one else is in double figures. No one else has won back-to-back titles in either the original European Cup knockout format or the modern Champions League era.It is true that Real’s near-impossible numbers are largely thanks to the dream start they had in European competition, when the side of Alfredo Di Stefano and (later) Ferenc Puskas won the first five editions of the European Cup before the rest of the continent got its act together, though the idea that the club’s potency is based on ancient history does not bear scrutiny.The cold fact Liverpool supporters must face is that their opponents are preparing for their fourth final in five years. Not only that, the previous three have all been won. Liverpool are fond of the boast that they have won the European title five times, and in terms of English football they have every right to be. Their successes of 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984 and 2005 put them easily at the top of the list of achievers from this country.Their nearest challengers are Manchester United with three, Nottingham Forest (still) with two and Chelsea finally managed it in 2012. Apart from Real Madrid only Milan have won more (seven), and with five wins spread over three decades Liverpool find themselves level with Bayern Munich and Barcelona.Yet should Real Madrid win in Kiev it would confirm a dominance once thought unattainable in the modern version of the contest. Four wins in five seasons would be arguably more attention-grabbing.Until last season no team had been able to win back-to-back Champions League titles. In 24 years of intense competition the rejigged format had produced a different winner every time. Not even Barcelona at their most brilliant managed to win the European Cup then do it again the following season.The old patterns of success, which had seen distinct periods of dominance by outstanding sides such as Ajax (three consecutive wins between 1971 and 1973), Bayern Munich (three in a row between 1974 and 1976), or Internazionale, Forest and Milan winning it back to back in the mid-60s, late 70s and late 80s respectively, were thought to have been consigned to history. Uefa must have been quite pleased with itself for devising a competition so difficult to crack but now the possibility is being contemplated of a team who have already won two in a row making it three.Should that happen, and even if it does not happen, Real Madrid deserve enormous credit for consistency.The talk on Merseyside is that this might be Liverpool’s year. Yet there is a recognition within that expression that under the modern format even a club with a rich European pedigree might manage a tilt at the ultimate title only once in a while – not every year certainly and not for a club like Liverpool or, from the look of things, Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Barcelona or Bayern Munich either.All these are now relative strangers to European Cup finals whereas Real Madrid are beginning to feel at home. There might have been a 12-year gap between the Zinedine Zidane volley in Glasgow that earned a ninth European title in 2002 and the victory over Atlético Madrid in Lisbon that took Carlo Ancelotti’s side into double figures, but victories over Atlético and Juventus in the last couple of finals have firmly re-established Real Madrid’s pre-eminence.Liverpool’s task in Kiev is to find a way of prospering against the savviest team around. History counts for only so much but the record books show that Liverpool have been in two European Cup finals since the competition was reorganised in 1993. They won one, famously, in 2005, and lost the next to Milan in Athens two years later. Real Madrid have appeared in six finals over the same period and won the lot.The acceleration over the past few years means Real Madrid actually have a higher success rate – six wins in 25 attempts – under the new format than the old one, where despite their blistering start they added only the 1966 title to their initial five to record six wins over 37 seasons.So in one sense Cristiano Ronaldo and his pals are very much the Real deal, a trophy machine even more efficient than the original, something that will be glaringly obvious should they prevail on Saturday. Of the 15 in which they have competed, they have lost only three. Adam and the Ants were at No 1 with Stand and Deliver the last time Real Madrid lost a European Cup final, Bob Champion had just won the Grand National on Aldaniti and England was about to come to a halt for a royal wedding. It was 37 years ago in other words but their opponents in 1981 were Liverpool."

Alex McLeish has said Scotland will have to perform acts of “giantkilling” against Peru and Mexico after the number of withdrawals from his squad stretched to six. McLeish, who already had a makeshift party for the upcoming friendlies, lost the Celtic midfielder Stuart Armstrong and the Hearts defender John Souttar on Monday due to injury. The Scots travel to face Peru in Lima on 29 May before a meeting in Mexico City on 2 June.“It is getting quite thin,” Scotland’s manager said of his squad. “We have some great players out there and we want them to be ready and available to play for Scotland. Hopefully we can do a giantkilling act. Wigan beat Manchester City in a recent FA Cup game so we are looking for those kind of performances and the fellows to play above their performance levels like they have never done before.”McLeish hinted at the late additions of United States-based players to bolster his squad. The former Liverpool defender Danny Wilson now plays for Colorado Rapids while Sam Nicholson, the former Hearts winger, recently moved to the same club from Minnesota United. “There’s a couple of other Scottish boys out there who have good experience we can maybe call upon,” McLeish said. “We will assess things on Tuesday morning.”The Scotland manager is aware of wider scepticism regarding the motivations of players at the conclusion to their domestic season. McLeish, who has taken charge of only two fixtures in his second Scotland tenure, admitted he must tread carefully with regards to building relationships with clubs. With Scotland not in the World Cup, clubs have no obligation to send players on international duty for friendlies. McLeish earlier opted not to call upon a key batch of Celtic players when mindful both of their need for rest and Champions League qualifiers in mid-summer.“You have to hope everyone else genuinely wanted to come to play for their country and enhance their careers,” he said. “It is not to be. It is a shame to lose Stuart, a tremendous player. But we are looking forward to the overall grand scheme of things.“ Sometimes managers can rage and say, ‘Well listen, we are wanting to do a medical with them’ but we have to trust in the clubs and we have to have a rapport with the clubs. That has definitely got to be an ongoing thing.”He added: “It has been very difficult at this particular time with the end of the season and players playing on with injuries in the last few weeks. We have made some concessions with James McArthur and that kind of thing but the late call-offs were disappointing. But I am not blaming the players.“Stuart has a little tweak in his hamstring, he flagged it up right after the Scottish Cup final on Saturday.“John Souttar is gagging to play for the full national team. He has come through the system and the process and had a good season, so hopefully he will keep learning and improve on what has been a very good season for him.”"

As if to demonstrate the renewed efficiency introduced since the enthronement of Gianni Infantino, forces within Fifa appear on course to banjax two World Cups in the same year. Firstly, there is the 2018 edition, for which the world governing body insists a Video Assistant Referee system must be used in high-pressure situations by officials who have never worked with it. And then there is the ongoing bidding for the 2026 World Cup, so called because of the number of participants expected to be allowed in, and which factions within Fifa want to be co-hosted by countries who could be separated by mean-spirited rhetoric and a gigantic wall.The head of Fifa’s Technology Innovation Department, Johannes Holzmüller, admitted this week he has been “sweating” about the imminent use of VAR “because we were unsure if everything works perfectly”. Speaking confidently into an upturned bean tin atop a state-of-the-art broom handle, Holzmüller said his fears have now been allayed even though the system is still some way short of perfection. How far short? Hard to say. If only there were some kind of beeping contraption to tell us. “Now that we go into the [Ethics] World Cup we are quite sure that we will have the best setup that is possible at the moment,” ventured Holzmüller, while acknowledging: “It is technology. It can fail.”But hey, humans fail all the time so you can’t trust them either. Isn’t that right, Fifa? “Only one decision at the next World Cup — only one — is enough to say ‘VAR was good to be introduced,’” blathered its director of refereeing, Massimo Busacca. “The aim is not to achieve 100% calls for all decisions, only to avoid scandal.” Presumably he’s talking about scandals like Geoff Hurst’s goal in the 1966 World Cup final or Diego Maradona in 1986. And not about the VAR-related goof that determined the Australian title last weekend; or the farce in the Bundesliga last month that led to VAR being used to award Mainz a penalty during half-time; or the squiggly line that adjudged Juan Mata offside while scoring for Manchester United at Huddersfield two months ago.Meanwhile, intrigue mounts before next month’s vote on the hosts of the 2026 World Cup. There are two bids on the table – a combined one from USA! USA!! USA!!!, Canada and Mexico, and a solo one from Morocco. Fifa stands to earn much more money from the so-called “United” bid. There have been allegations of political pressure from the White House and influential people within Fifa to support that bid. But others within Fifa believe a World Cup in Morocco would be better for football. If anything scandalous were to affect the eventual decision, Fifa is unlikely to have any video evidence that could assist an investigation.“More than a dream, more than a canal. Panama is here to play” – Fifa invites fans to vote on the slogans painted on the side of teams’ World Cup buses, and somewhat short-changes Panama (though Brazil’s “The nation of soccer cleats” runs it close).Producing the Guardian’s thoughtful, in-depth journalism – the stuff not normally found in these emails, obviously – is expensive, but supporting us isn’t.

I hope this reassures, and does not too greatly disappoint, the Fiver’s army of cocoa-drinking readers” – David Sweet (and 1,057 other cocoa-drinking readers).“I was surprised to read in last week’s World Cup FiveЯ, given their somewhat unenthusiastic endorsement of alcohol, that the United Arab Emirates had participated and actually won the Kirin Cup, a competition sponsored by a brewery.

football,"A fourth consecutive double is almost secured for Juve after a Coppa Italia final that featured redemption for Mehdi Benatia and despair for Milan
Paolo Bandini

Thu 10 May 2018 11.43 BST

A 4-0 victory to seal a fourth consecutive Coppa Italia. So absolute is Juventus’s domination of the domestic scene these days that they can apparently even afford themselves self-referential scorelines. No team had ever won so many consecutive editions of this tournament. Then again, that was already true last year.Milan were the opponents whose dreams they shattered this time at the Stadio Olimpico. Before kick-off you could take your pick of the storylines: from Leonardo Bonucci seeking to get one over on his former team to the duel-at-a-distance between a nation’s greatest goalkeeper, Gigi Buffon, and his heir apparent, Gianluigi Donnarumma. Over 90 minutes we were reminded there is only one winning narrative in Italian football these days, and it is written by the team in black and white.Or perhaps it would be more apt to speak of a game played in 20 minutes, not 90. That was all it took for this final to transform from a tense but uneventful affair into a lopsided rout. Milan had played with justifiable caution throughout the first half and succeeded in keeping things tight. As soon as they fell behind, they fell apart.Three of Juve’s four goals were gifted to them. Donnarumma allowed a Douglas Costa shot to slip through his fingers for the second, before dropping a ball at Mehdi Benatia’s feet for the third. The fourth was an own goal by Nikola Kalinic. Only the opener, headed in by Benatia from a corner, came without a Milan assist.This was a day of redemption for the Moroccan, after a month in which he became the scapegoat for a side that were in danger of throwing this season away. It was he who gave away the penalty that killed Juventus’s hopes of a sensational Champions League comeback in Madrid. Benatia then lost Kalidou Koulibaly for Napoli’s winner at the Allianz Stadium, a goal that briefly reignited the Serie A title race. He did not help himself with his remarks at the end of the Madrid defeat, likening the penalty award to a “rape” and subsequently engaging in a war of words with the comedian Maurizio Crozza – who called him out on his use of language (while unhelpfully extending the sexual metaphor in his own response). Massimiliano Allegri, perhaps sensing the player was distracted, dropped him against Bologna and Inter.The manager knows very well, though, how important Benatia has been. It would be easy to kid ourselves that Bonucci’s departure made no impact on a team that have continued to sweep all before them, but the reality is that there were times in the early part of this season when Juventus looked far less assured. They began the campaign by shipping three goals in a Supercoppa defeat to Lazio. Five separate opponents had put two or more past them by the end of October.It was only from late November that things really started to come together, Juventus conceding only a single goal in 16 games across all competitions. Giorgio Chiellini was injured at the start of that sequence. Benatia had served as cover for the famous BBC during much of his first season in Turin, but his cool reading of the game and capacity for playing the ball out from defence had now become indispensable.That is just another example of how this Juventus team have continued to evolve and adapt, the first-team squad subject to constant change over the four years of Allegri’s leadership, yet always capable of getting results when it matters. Milan, for all their vast expenditure last summer, remain a very long way behind.Defeat here means their spot in Europe next season is still not guaranteed. They sit sixth in Serie A, one point ahead of Atalanta and three ahead of Fiorentina – both of whom they face in the remaining two weeks. Even falling to seventh would be painful, obliging them to begin Europa League qualifying in July.Whether Donnarumma will be around to make the next step with them is open to doubt. He looked to be on the verge of tears as Bonucci sought to console him at full-time. Buffon offered his namesake a kiss and a pat on the cheek that may have been a little harder than he intended.Then the older man jogged off to enjoy the moment with his team-mates. Corks were popped, champagne sprayed and Allegri thrown up in the air. As Buffon told it late last year: “I drink little, but I celebrate quite a bit.”For Juventus, winning is a habit. They ran through this entire Coppa Italia without conceding a goal. The only question now is whether they complete a fourth consecutive domestic double on Sunday at this same stadium, away to Roma, or leave that for the final weekend, when they host relegated Verona in Turin.The story is already written. All that remains is to see if Juventus can give it an end as fitting as the scoreline they produced on Wednesday night."

Antonio Conte talks after Chelsea’s dismal performance at Newcastle.We lost the game and I think deserved to have this defeat. I don’t know, for sure Newcastle look more determined than us. I think this. For sure, we didn’t lose a place in the Champions League today, or on the last two games. The chances were zero. But I think to finish the season this way, it’s not good. It’s not good for the team, not good for the players, not good for the fans. Now we have six days to prepare for the FA Cup final, and for sure we have to change. Our start today wasn’t good.When there is this situation, the first person to answer for this must be the coach. Because if in this game we had this spirit, this will, this desire, I think that I’m the first person to answer for this. You’re talking about the other team being more determined. I think today I wasn’t able to transfer that determination to my players.

Stuart James watched as Swansea’s far-fetched hopes of salvation came to nought:There was a funereal feel about this fixture as Stoke, who were already down, condemned Swansea City to relegation and a place in the Championship alongside them. Swansea, in truth, were resigned to their fate on Wednesday night, after Huddersfield grabbed an unlikely point at Chelsea, meaning that Carlos Carvalhal’s side needed a footballing miracle on the final day of the season.

17:20

Dominic Fifield saw Crystal Palace climb to 11th place in the league, and West Brom slip back to the bottom:This game ended up a celebration of Roy Hodgson, with the affection bellowed by both sets of supporters. The home support in the Holmesdale end waited until early in the second half to unfurl their banners of appreciation, with the ground then united in chorusing the former England manager’s name. He looked almost sheepish acknowledging the adulation.

At Southampton, Dusan Tadic hasn’t just taken off and given away his shirt – his vest, shorts and socks have gone as well, and he’s walking off the pitch in a jockstrap.

17:16

Jacob Steinberg was at the London Stadium, where West Ham won and Everton were rubbish:It spoke volumes that the Everton fans did not spring to the defence of their manager when the locals started having fun at Sam Allardyce’s expense. They simply could not be bothered and are unlikely to shed any tears if this limp defeat marks the end of Allardyce’s unhappy tenure.

Andy Hunter witnessed Mo Salah’s latest goalscoring exploits at Anfield:Liverpool may have left it typically late to seal Champions League qualification but their farewell to the Premier League season and warm-up for Real Madrid was otherwise faultless. Mohamed Salah began a comprehensive win over Brighton with a record 32nd league goal of the campaign and Kop favourite Andy Robertson capped it with his first for the club. Anfield could only admire the exhibition in between.

5.13pm BST
17:13

Jamie Jackson watched Michael Carrick’s Old Trafford farewell:Michael Carrick’s 464th and final Manchester United appearance featured a vintage moment via a sweet pass that created Marcus Rashford’s first-half winner. The midfielder had walked out to a guard of honour and on 80 minutes strode off the turf for a last time to a standing ovation.

5.11pm BST
17:11

Ben Fisher was at St Mary’s to see Manchester City smash another record:How fitting that Manchester City would finish an extraordinary season with a bang. Gabriel Jesus, a substitute here, hoisted a wonderful dinked effort into the net with only seconds of the Premier League season left after meeting a flighted Kevin De Bruyne ball to earn the champions’ 32nd win of the campaign, attaining a landmark and record-breaking century of points in the process.

5.09pm BST
17:09

The match reports are trickling in now. This from Paul Doyle at Huddersfield:Arsène Wenger’s powers may have dwindled in recent years but at least his last match at Arsenal ended in the same way his first one did in 1996, with his team taking three points. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the Frenchman’s last major signing at the north London club, made sure of that detail by stabbing into the net from close range in the 38th minute.

5.08pm BST
17:08

Mo Salah has a chat:This one is very special. As I said before many times, it’s always on my mind to help with the team. Now we’re in the Champions League and I won the award, so I’m very proud to do it. It’s always in my mind to succeed in England, with 100% to give more to succeed here. I had a great season. I’m trying to improve every year. I’m very happy. I improve year after year, I’m very proud about that. 

5.05pm BST
17:05

Arsene Wenger’s final post-match TV interview concludes:I believe I had an impact on the club as a whole, because the club today is in a strong position. A new stadium, a new training ground, they’re all paid basically. We played 48 games unbeaten, it’s difficult to imagine. I’m very proud as well for winning seven FA Cups. I see a bright future for my successor, the team has a good attitude and good quality. We need two or three additions, and after that I believe the club will compete for the championship.

5.04pm BST
17:04

On the pitch at Anfield, Mo Salah has brought out all of his individual awards for this ridiculous, over-achieving season, and is being presented with one more – the golden boot.

And here’s the league table:

Manchester United are closing in on the signing of the Brazil midfielder Fred from Shakhtar Donetsk for €50m (£43.7m) but an attempt to add Sergej Milinkovic‑Savic to José Mourinho’s squad has been put on hold for now after Lazio set the 23-year-old’s asking price at €100m (£87.4m).United are in advanced talks with the Ukrainian club and representatives of Fred, who had also interested Manchester City as a potential long-term replacement for Fernandinho, and hope to finalise a deal in the coming days. Predominantly a defensive midfielder who can also play at left‑back, the 25-year-old signed a five-year contract in January and was included in Brazil’s squad for next month’s World Cup.After the retirement of Michael Carrick and with Marouane Fellaini yet to sign a contract extension at Old Trafford, Mourinho is looking to bolster his midfield options this summer and United have also registered a strong interest in Milinkovic-Savic. However, after Lazio failed to qualify for the Champions League next season, it is understood that the Italian side want a fee worth up to €100m (£87.4m) for the Serbia international, who is under contract in Rome until 2022. Milinkovic-Savic’s agent, Mateja Kezman, said last week that there is “enormous interest” in the Spain-born midfielder, although United are not willing to spend a fee that would come close to the €105m they paid Juventus for Paul Pogba in 2016.United have also showed an interest in Nice’s Ivory Coast midfielder Jean Michaël Seri, who has been tracked by Arsenal, Chelsea and City in the past, although Pep Guardiola’s side have been in negotiations over a £52m move for the Napoli midfielder Jorginho.One player who looks set to depart Old Trafford this summer is Matteo Darmian. The Italy defender has only one year of his contract remaining and is expected to join Juventus, the Serie A champions, for about €12m."
football,"The Bursaspor defender says if one of his Nigerian team-mates is offended in Russia and no longer wants to play, the rest of the squad will fall into line behind him

When England face Nigeria on Saturday they will line up against a man with a more quintessentially English upbringing than anyone in a white shirt at Wembley. Will Troost-Ekong was educated at boarding school in Bishop’s Stortford and speaks with the accent his parents intended when they sent him to these shores at the age of 12.Troost-Ekong, the son of a Nigerian father and Dutch mother, received a privileged education at Hockerill college and it also set him on the path to his career, although not one usually associated with a boarding school alumnus. Now he is using his status as a professional footballer to help those less fortunate, recently becoming one of only four players going to the World Cup to sign up for Juan Mata’s Common Goal charity.“It’s not an achievement but it’s a really exciting step for me to do something like this,” Troost-Ekong explains as we sit inside Bursaspor’s Timsah Arena. “I was looking to do different charity projects to get involved in,” he says. “I’ve done a few already, but it was nice to do something public like Common Goal, simply because it’s good that footballers unite and do something together. No matter how much you make or whatever club you play at, you can be part of something like that. I think I am very blessed to be here in Turkey and to have the things I have now, so it’s nice to give something back.“I wanted to be part of it as a Nigerian, so then hopefully more of my international and Bursaspor team-mates will want to join. I think it’s growing steady but I think it will be infectious once people see the projects that we will do together or the impact we can have as football players, which is not very big to us, but is to some other people. I think it should be infectious and the more footballers that sign up, the more powerful it will become.”The 24-year-old is expecting a busy summer, starting with the game at Wembley. He will then be at the heart of the Nigeria defence in Russia and his childhood sweetheart, from Hertfordshire, will be giving birth to their first child, leaving plenty on his mind. Troost‑Ekong was born in the Netherlands but there are few prouder Nigerians.Having played in England, the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium and now Turkey, Troost-Ekong has seen plenty and knows the importance of setting an example to the wider world. He is acutely aware that Nigerian players could be subject to racial abuse in Russia this summer and the team will not be afraid to take a hard line on it.“We haven’t openly spoken about it in the team,” he says. “Everyone is aware of it but I don’t think until that moment, if it were to come, that you can prepare for something like that. I think if we felt in any way that there was very apparent racism, which everyone would be uncomfortable with, if anyone said: ‘We’re not going to play,’ then the team would make a unanimous decision. We have a great team spirit so if one player said they didn’t want to play, everyone would stick with that.”The preparation for that starts with England in the country where he was educated, in which his partner grew up and where his first child will be born. It will be emotional for Troost‑Ekong, who will come up against his former Tottenham team-mate Harry Kane. “It’ll be nice to play against Harry again after all these years, so it will be exciting. It will be a bit of a homecoming seeing as I spent some time in England and I have such strong ties in England. And quite a lot of the team play in England and so many Nigerians live in England, so it will be a nice atmosphere.”The journey to the World Cup started over a decade ago when he was spotted playing for Bishop’s Stortford as a teenager by Fulham, who he represented until Tottenham lured him to their academy. “At 15 I got an offer to go to Spurs – Man City and Liverpool were interested too at the time to give me a scholarship. I ended up signing at Spurs because I wanted to stay in London and I really like the set-up and the people working there.”As a youth, Troost-Ekong represented the Netherlands but then chose Nigeria, a decision fully justified since making his debut in 2015. From that point he has won an Olympic bronze medal, captained the Super Eagles and helped them reach the World Cup. They face Argentina, Croatia and Iceland in Group D in Russia but Troost-Ekong is not fazed.“It’s hard because we’ve got a really difficult group but I think we can surprise like we did in qualifying, as we were not the favourites to go through, with Cameroon and Algeria there, but we were unbeaten apart from the last game [awarded 3-0 to Algeria because of an ineligible player]. We have a new coach and a lot of young players coming through, so I think at the World Cup we can do the same. ”"
test_data_samples,"Why are England so inconsistent in Test cricket?
There was relief rather than satisfaction etched on the faces of the England coaching staff after the Headingley victory, their first Test win since September last year.

That is partly because they have grown used to the wild fluctuations in England's Test performances.

In the past three years - a span of 42 matches - England have only once won three Tests in a row. There is always a defeat looming around the corner.

The old saying about Pakistan that you never know which team is going to turn up applies now as much to Joe Root's side.

Why are England, with more professional players and resources than any other country, so inconsistent and languishing in fifth spot - just above Sri Lanka - in the International Cricket Council's Test rankings?

If you look at the most successful Test teams of all time - West Indies (1980-1995) and Australia (1995-2004) - their success was founded on outstanding opening pairs, and a combination of penetrative and restrictive bowlers.

West Indies' Desmond Haynes and Gordon Greenidge are the most prolific opening partnership in Test history (6,482 runs together at an average of 47) followed by Australia's Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer (5,655 runs, average 51).

They provided a solid foundation on which the rest of the structure could be built.

Since the retirement of Andrew Strauss in 2012, England's foundations have been decidedly rickety.

Alastair Cook - England's leading Test run-scorer of all time - has had 12 different opening partners in that time, and none - apart from Root himself, who averaged 41 as an opener - can be considered a success.

Cook's recent 11-Test opening partnership with Mark Stoneman averaged just 16 runs per outing.

England's most successful recent periods - 2003-2005 and 2008-2011 - coincided with two of their most reliable opening pairs: Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss (who averaged 52 in partnership) and Strauss and Cook, whose 4,711 runs (at 41 per partnership) is the third all-time highest aggregate behind Greenidge and Haynes and Hayden and Langer.

You cannot underestimate the value of good opening partnerships. It blunts the opposition's main cutting edge - the new ball - and gives the rest of the batting order breathing space.

Batting is much easier against a ball that is 20 overs old and has lost its initial hardness. But because of England's shaky opening pairs they are frequently 80-4 and having to rebuild.

Good opening pairs also pave the way for individual hundreds, which give a team vital ballast. England averaged 1.21 hundreds a Test between 2006 and 2010 (when Strauss and Cook opened and England won the Ashes home and away).

In the past three years they have averaged only 0.72 hundreds per Test.

test_data_samples,"French Open 2018: How do you stop 'King of clay' Rafael Nadal?
2018 French Open men's final
Venue: Roland Garros, Paris Date: Sunday, 10 June Time: 14:00 BST
Coverage: Live radio and text commentary on BBC Radio 5 live, the BBC Sport website and app.

The beauty about sport is we never know what might happen when we arrive at a stadium or turn on our television.

But one thing comes as close to sporting certainty as anything else we have seen over the past 13 years: Rafael Nadal winning the French Open.

""Some say beating Rafa over five sets on clay is the toughest thing in sport - not just tennis,"" says seven-time Grand Slam singles champion John McEnroe. ""I would agree with that.""

Since making his debut as a talented teenager in 2005, Nadal has won a record 10 singles titles at Roland Garros - no-one in the men's game has managed to win as many at the same Grand Slam.

And few are backing the chances of Austria's seventh seed Dominic Thiem stopping the 32-year-old Spaniard lifting the Coupe des Mousquetaires again on Sunday.

What makes the man nicknamed the 'King of Clay' almost unstoppable on the red dirt? And how do you beat him over five sets in Paris?

We've asked former Grand Slam champions McEnroe, Michael Chang and Pat Cash, along with analysts and journalists, to tell us.
His vicious forehand and movement

Nadal won 37 sets in a row at Roland Garros, surpassing his own previous best streak of 32, before Diego Schwartzman stopped him moving closer to Bjorn Borg's all-time record of 41 by winning the opener in their quarter-final.

Borg won six French Open titles between 1974 and 1981, setting a record that stood until it was surpassed by Nadal in 2012.

""I was around the era where I thought I was watching the greatest - I was at the time - Borg. Nadal eclipses him,"" said McEnroe, a Roland Garros finalist in 1984.

Nadal's main weapon is that vicious, lasso-style forehand which has become his trademark.

Nobody has hit a higher percentage of forehand winners than the Spaniard over the past fortnight, with 12% of his points coming through this shot before his ruthless semi-final win over Juan Martin del Potro.

That, added to his sharp movement and supreme athleticism, is what makes Nadal great, according to Chang.

""He has the uncanny ability of being able to hit a lot of forehands and move very well on clay,"" the American, who won Roland Garros as a 17-year-old in 1989, told BBC Sport.

""He knows how to manipulate the angles to build to get people out of position.

""He is very aggressive, although patient when he needs to be, but for the most part if the shot is there he is taking it and going for it.

""He's the one manipulating, making you move and putting you in awkward positions to the point where he has easy cutaways.""
"
test_data_samples,"World Cup 2018: Will an African team reach semi-finals for first time?
""When I first started to coach Ivory Coast I said to Didier Drogba: 'We have some fantastic players and we can go far in the World Cup.' He said: 'No we can't'.""

Sven-Goran Eriksson is trying to shed some light on why Africa is still waiting for a first World Cup triumph more than 20 years after Brazil legend Pele predicted a winner from the continent by 2000. By the end of the 2010 World Cup, the Swede understood Drogba was not being negative - just realistic.

""The reason why they don't do it? One word: organisation. It was total chaos when I joined,"" Eriksson told BBC Sport.

At one stage, Pele's prediction looked like it might come to pass. Nigeria came top of a group featuring Argentina and Diego Maradona at the 1994 edition, while the likes of George Weah and Jay-Jay Okocha were making their mark in Europe during the 1990s.

Yet Africa, the second most-populated continent and a place where football is king, has still to produce a team to advance beyond the quarter-finals - let alone lift the gold trophy.

Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal and Tunisia will compete in Russia later this month - but few believe they will get near the final, including former Cameroon defender Lauren.

""I could say we'll have a team in the semi-finals but that's not the reality,"" said the two-time Africa Cup of Nations winner. ""We're still behind the top teams.""

Power shift in Africa?

None of the five heading to Russia are in the top 20 of Fifa's world rankings and Peter Odemwingie, the former Nigeria forward, claims African football has gone backwards.

""There's definitely been a decline,"" said the ex-West Brom, Cardiff and Stoke striker, who played at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.

""Nigeria had one of the best African squads at the 1994 World Cup. We were knocking on the door. We won the 1996 Olympics by beating Brazil and Argentina with all their stars.

""That period was like, 'yes, it's coming'.""

But Nigeria, who will be competing at their sixth finals in Russia, are still waiting. Along with the rest of Africa.

The three teams to make the quarter-finals - Cameroon (1990) , Senegal (2002) and Ghana (2010) - have come from sub-Saharan Africa.

But in Russia, there will be more teams from the north than elsewhere on the continent, including a first appearance in 28 years for Egypt and a return after 20 years for Morocco.

A number of north African countries have players who learned their trade at academies in Europe, but it is Morocco who arrive at this World Cup with the most foreign-born players - seventeen of their 23-man squad were born outside the country.

Odemwingie believes those who play for the north African nations are ""more clever"" at reading the game and has also noticed a physical difference.

""It's like Anthony Joshua fighting Floyd Mayweather,"" he said on comparing a typical player from sub-Saharan Africa with one from the north. ""The players in the north are a little bit leaner.

""They always start free-kicks faster, they have the mental game a bit more than the sub-Saharan teams.""

Allegations of spot-fixing by three England cricketers during a Test in India 18 months ago have been described as “outrageous” by their head coach, Trevor Bayliss, and captain, Joe Root, amid a flurry of denials in response to an investigation by al-Jazeera.The documentary, Cricket’s Match-Fixers, was made public by the Qatar‑based broadcaster on Sunday, containing the allegation that England players deliberately batted defensively to order for a short passage of play during the fifth Test in Chennai in December 2016. This prompted the England and Wales Cricket Board to release a strongly worded statement from its chief executive, Tom Harrison, stating that the players “emphatically deny the allegations” and the material since shown has given the board “no reason” to doubt this.Harrison said: “There is nothing we have seen that would make us doubt any of our players in any way whatsoever. The limited information we have been given has been discussed with all the England players.“They emphatically deny the allegations, have stated categorically that the claims are false and they have our full support. Neither ECB nor the ICC is aware of any credible evidence connecting any England players to any form of corruption.” Bayliss, the head coach who took over the England team in 2015, told Sky Sports: “Outrageous. I knew a documentary was going to be coming out. I wouldn’t have a clue what’s in it yet, or seen it. But, having been there [at the Chennai Test], outrageous is all I can say.”Root, also speaking after the side’s nine-wicket defeat against Pakistan at Lord’s on Sunday, said: “I am aware that there is a documentary and it is outrageous that our players have been accused. All the players have the full backing of the ECB.”The programme shows the alleged middle man, Aneel Munawar, telling al-Jazeera’s undercover team which element of the Chennai Test will be manipulated, with players due to score slowly for a set number of overs. This information is to be used for betting purposes. Names of those allegedly involved are only stated by Munawar after the event but, like the specific information regarding which overs were allegedly manipulated, these are redacted in the final edit.Munawar, who is confronted by al-Jazeera’s reporter at the end of documentary but leaves the room without comment, is alleged to work for “D-Company”, a syndicate that controls much of the illegal betting market in India that is worth an estimated $60bn per year.A similar claim of spot-fixing is also made regarding two Australia players during the third Test against India in Ranchi last year. Cricket Australia responded before the documentary’s full broadcast with a statement from the chief executive, James Sutherland, that, like that of the ECB, insisted there was no “credible evidence”.The two boards have made public their frustration at being given little material by al-Jazeera before the documentary was broadcast. The ICC had previously said this too and urged the network to share all unedited materials for its anti-corruption unit to investigate.In response to the full broadcast, the International Cricket Council’s head of anti‑corruption, Alex Marshall, said: “The ICC has now had the opportunity to view the documentary and as we have previously stated, we are taking the contents and the allegations it has made extremely seriously. A full investigation is now under way to examine each claim made.“We have been in ongoing dialogue with the broadcaster which has refused our continual requests to cooperate and share information which has hampered our investigation to date. The content of the programme is of course useful, but I would now urge the production team to provide us with all unedited and unseen evidence they are in possession of. Given this is a live investigation and one that is likely to be subject to the legal process, it is not possible to provide any further comment.”As well as these two specific Tests, the documentary also alleges that the pitch at Galle in Sri Lanka can be tailored to specified outcomes for betting purposes. This allegedly took place during Tests against India and Australia in 2016 and 2017, with a further “pitch-fix” due when England tour in November. “Sri Lanka Cricket wishes to state that it has zero tolerance towards corruption and will take immediate action against any person involved in the alleged incident, if found guilty,” it said in a statement."

There is no fiercer battle than the one to be the least appealing individual in British sporting governance. It is a field in which we are absolutely world class. From the FA to the RFU to the ECB to the Jockey Club and far beyond, we really bring home the bacon. All the cured pork, in fact. Of all the games we invented, this is the last one we can always be sure of winning.And yet, even by the high standards of his peers, the England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, Colin Graves, is having an excellent run. I think the clinching factor is how much Colin clearly seems to hate cricket. In one sense, even that’s not weird. All populists secretly hate their people. All bookies secretly hate their punters. And all sports blazers secretly hate their sport. You only have to look at Gianni Infantino’s sporticidal plans for a 48-team World Cup, and ever more competitive black-tie award ceremonies, to see a similar tendency.But the common thread is that they tend to do it secretly. Colin’s distaste for cricket appears ever more open. How else to read his comments to the BBC’s Simon Mann on Monday? Colin was justifying The Hundred, a highly uncalled-for fourth format of the game he seems bent on driving through, despite vocal resistance from the Professional Cricketers’ Association, many players past and present, and a demographic we’ll call “members of the public who like cricket”.He is doing this, he reasoned, because cricket as we know it has nothing to offer young people. “The younger generation, whether you like it or not, are just not attracted to cricket,” Colin explained. “They want something different. They want it to be more exciting. They want it shorter. They want it simpler to understand.”Before he makes a dash for the lawyers – of which more later – I should say it is perfectly possible Colin doesn’t realise he dislikes cricket at all. He almost certainly believes he loves it. That might be his tragedy. It is likely that his antipathy towards cricket is wholly subconscious, buried beneath that monogram-gated exterior. It is up to you to speculate quite how many – or quite how few – hours Colin would need on the couch of a Viennese-school psychoanalyst to tease out the possibility. Or, to keep an open mind, for the shrink to come up with another credible explanation as to why he has frequently disparaged the appeal of various forms of the game. It wasn’t long into his tenure at the ECB before he was describing the record ticket-selling T20 Blast competition as “mediocre”. So he has form for tipping on the ECB’s own products, to use the parlance of our times.Yet the more contradictory positions that emanate from the ECB, the harder it is to shake the feeling that if it isn’t happening in the immediate vicinity of the chairman’s walnut gearknobbed saloon, he isn’t powerfully aware of it. Colin’s interview aired on the very day the ECB announced that 50,000 youngsters have signed up to participate in its All Stars Cricket initiative this summer. Never mind knowing what the other is doing – is the ECB’s right hand even in the same time zone as its left hand?I’m reminded of Alan Partridge ringing his son and being appalled to discover where he is. “Fernando,” he despairs, “you’re 22 years old and you’re spending your Saturday afternoon in bed with a girl. You’re wasting your life.” And so with Colin’s declaration coming on the day of the All Stars news. Kids, you’re squandering your youth with this stuff! Have you tried football instead?Alas, Colin’s tenure has already become too much for some. As ECB board member Andy Nash put it in his resignation letter a few weeks ago: “I’ve recently become concerned that the standards of corporate governance at ECB are falling well short of what’s acceptable and in all conscience, I can’t allow myself to continue to be associated with it. I would be failing in my duty as a director if I didn’t bring these to the board’s attention and this I’ve tried to do.”What can one say? Not a lot, if the lawyers have anything to do with it. His regime is already reportedly suing ESPNcricinfo’s George Dobell. Other threats of a trip down the Strand seem likely. They might even sue over Nash’s resignation letter, who knows? After the Mann interview, Graves might be considering suing Glamorgan for the time-bending feat of pre-contradicting him. By way of recap, Graves said on Monday of the suggestion the ECB compensated counties for the years they miss out on staging a Test: “No payments have been made to counties at all.” Yet Glamorgan stated in March: “Following discussions with the ECB the club decided not to apply to host Test matches during the 2020 to 2024 period in return for a compensation payment of £2.5m.”As for the continuing point of Colin Graves, it is a matter of increasing speculation. He might well be a form of blazered Terminator, sent back in time with the sole mission of throwing former ECB chairman Giles Clarke into sympathetic relief. Either way, his innovation has more and more vocal detractors. Whatever the broadcasters might prefer, most believe that the various forms of the game we already have just need a little TLC. Which is to say: Colin is chasing waterfalls, when he really should stick to the rivers and the lakes that he’s used to."

For the romantic rather than the English patriot, the Lord’s Test provided a wonderful outcome.England were humbled by the pace trio of Mohammad Abbas, Hasan Ali and Mohammad Amir. Abbas is a former leather worker from Sialkot, who has been playing in the most uncharted domestic competition in the world for seven or eight years before an excursion as Leicestershire’s overseas player (maybe not the most glamorous of overseas gigs); Hasan’s parents wanted him to get a proper job as a lawyer so they apparently burned his cricket whites; Amir is the cricketing prodigal son, misled in his teens, who has tenaciously fought his way back into international cricket.Amir has a certain notoriety, though it was shaming to hear a group of drunken young MCC members chanting “cheat, cheat” when he was running in to bowl on Friday. The other two are unfamiliar to the casual cricket fan. None play in the Indian Premier League because Pakistan cricketers are not welcome there; none play Test cricket on their native turf because that is not possible.They are unaccustomed to appearing in Test cricket with more than a few thousand spectators looking on. Yet here they were in front of packed stands at Lord’s clinically dissecting the best that England could offer. One of the best‑resourced sides in the world were being thrashed by an itinerant band of resolute, proud cricketers, making light of their homelessness.Waqar Younis, the great toe‑crushing fast bowler, said this was Pakistan’s best performance at Lord’s, which is high praise since Waqar played in that epic of 1992 when he combined with Wasim Akram to take most of the wickets and produce a critical ninth-wicket partnership of 46 to give their side an enthralling two-wicket victory.That Pakistan side were brimming with household names. Wasim and Waqar aside there was Javed Miandad, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Mushtaq Ahmed, Saleem Malik and Rameez Raja in the team. The names of this Pakistan side are not quite so familiar. Waqar is right about the scale of a performance at Lord’s that belies Pakistan’s recent record in Test cricket.Flip the coin and view the match from an English perspective and the picture is so much grimmer. Such a defeat is bewildering given the wealth of our game and all the resources poured into the national team and the development programmes for the Lions and beyond.The England and Wales Cricket Board may be reluctant to acknowledge this since it seems to suit them to talk down interest in the game in this country as a bizarre means of justifying their latest gimmick, but our capacity to host Test cricket is the envy of the world. Especially in the capital the ticket touts do a roaring trade; the cost of one day at Lord’s or the Oval would be more than enough to finance five days of a Test anywhere else in the world. Test cricket here is a huge asset.At the ECB there is much talk about the regeneration of the game, although one suspects that in its judgment this coincides with the regeneration of income and another whopping TV deal. This is the justification for a second short‑form game each season, which the ECB wants to remain The Hundred since this is the magic formula that will somehow be attractive to non-cricket lovers, wives and children.There is the belated recognition that taking all cricket away from free-to-air television, which was an option so financially alluring no entrepreneur could reject it, has been damaging to the game and there are now attempts to squeeze remnants of the toothpaste back into the tube. Here is a reminder of the minority view that the most lucrative choice is not always the best one.Perhaps the most potent way to sell and enhance the game has been overlooked recently. It is to have a national side who keep winning, whatever the format. Even when restricted to pay channels a winning side can penetrate the national consciousness; we like following winners.However there is little evidence to suggest those in charge are willing to sacrifice their plans to swamp the domestic season with more white-ball cricket throughout the prime times of the English summer. The red ball is destined for the margins of the season; the development of red-ball cricketers will be hindered and downgraded. Then if Test cricket here declines further one of our greatest income streams (perhaps it is helpful to use terms readily understood at the ECB) will be jeopardised."

In September 2017 Roosevelt Skerrit, the prime minister of Dominica, stood up in front of the UN general assembly. “Eden is broken,” he said.Skerrit had travelled to New York from his devastated island nation, battered to bare-root nakedness by Hurricane Maria, which spat out homes and lives, leaving behind flooding, landslides and a crumpled infrastructure. The category five storm splintered the island’s ancient forests, a Unesco world heritage site, ripping away the lush canopy to reveal a broken, brown reality.The storm also razed the island’s Windsor Park cricket stadium – and on Thursday a Rest of the World team take on the West Indies at Lord’s to raise money for its restoration, and that of James Ronald Webster Park in Anguilla, ruined by hurricane Irma just two weeks earlier.The game is a shining example of cricket acting for the common good. It will raise much-needed funds and the tickets, which are £10 for children, are reasonable. The game is being held during the half-term holiday and will be shown on Sky. It brings together players from around the globe including Rashid Khan, Shahid Afridi, Thisara Perera, Dinesh Karthik, and Mitchell McClenaghan under the captaincy of Eoin Morgan for the Rest of the World.But there is something missing. There has been no discussion of the reasons why the weather seems to be changing, what might be done to prevent it or why the hurricane season of 2017 was both so unprecedented and so brutal.No one weather event can be categorically labelled as “caused by climate change”. But scientists are confident that climate change is bringing more extreme weather events, and that it increases the severity of hurricanes, like Irma and Maria, as greenhouse gases trap energy in the atmosphere driving more powerful winds. Rising temperatures have led to higher sea levels, which in turn means bigger storm surges. Higher water temperatures lead to more evaporation of water into the air, and that means more rain and therefore a higher risk of flooding.Skerrit is in no doubt what is to blame for his island’s repeated battering. In April he spoke of the country’s plans to become the world’s first climate resilient nation. But, he asked, what of the rest of the planet?“In the current system, those who reap the financial benefits from the emissions of greenhouse gasses are not those who carry the costs. As a result, there is an underinvestment in limiting climate change, mitigating its costs and reducing climate-related damage. That is no longer a viable situation. The time for talk, conventions and declarations is over. The time for action is now,” said Skerrit.So what does cricket do? There is for the game both a responsibility and an opportunity in tackling climate change. Cricket, and its followers, have an emotional and physical bond with the land in a way that few other field sports do. From the dustbowls of Ahmedabad to the lush pastures of the Somerset levels, cricket is its environment. It affects the batting conditions, the way the ball moves, the choice of players on the field, the way the game is played.A roll-call of incidents from the the last few years suggest the scale of future challenges the game will have to face, and the risks of doing nothing. Last October Irma and Maria hit the Caribbean; this February the Western Province Cricket Association cancelled all club and school cricket because of severe drought in Cape Town and the surrounding areas. In 2016, 13 IPL games were moved from Maharashtra as parts of the state endured their worst drought for 100 years, and the control of water became a legal issue this April when the Mumbai high court forbade the Maharashtra Cricket Association from receiving water from the Pavana dam for its matches in Pune. Last December, air pollution in Delhi during the India v Sri Lanka Test resulted in players vomiting on the pitch and wearing face masks. Play was repeatedly held up and oxygen cylinders were brought into the dressing rooms. In England, 10 county grounds sit in cities where pollution levels exceed WHO recommendations. In the last month, a heatwave in Karachi has killed at least 65 people. And earlier this year, a report by the Climate Coalition named cricket as the game in the UK most likely to be affected by climate change. “There is clear evidence that climate change has had a huge impact on the game,” said Dan Musson, the ECB’s national participation manager, “in the form of general wet weather and extreme weather events.”Glamorgan, the sole Welsh voice in county cricket, have lost 1,300 overs of cricket since 2000 because of the weather. Their head of operations, Dan Cherry, is frank.“Losing so much cricket is a county’s worst nightmare – it affects the club at every level,” he has said. “It’s difficult even for first-class counties to be commercially viable with such an impact.”Steve Birks, the Trent Bridge groundsman, told the Cricket Paper only this month: “The rain is getting tropical, it is getting heavier. We’re getting thunderstorms more often when it rains – I think that’s when you can tell the difference.”Cricket must adapt to what the World Bank calls “the new climate normal” but it must also become part of the solution. On the day of the IPL final, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) signed an agreement to promote green cricket, “greening operations and engaging cricketers and fans in green initiatives”. The following months will give us an idea of how much the BCCI really cares, and how much is greenwash.Becoming a world leader, a shining example of good environmental practice would attract to cricket the much-desired growth audience – as well as being the right thing to do. Young people, in particular, care about the future of the planet in a way they might not care about, say, 100-ball cricket. Increasingly sponsors too are likely to look at environmental performance when calculating where to put their money.So many things could be done quite easily – large and small – from carbon audits to sensible tour planning to reduce the number of flights, from encouraging spectators to travel to matches in sustainable ways to curbing single-use plastic use. Some grounds, Lord’s and the Oval particularly, but also Edgbaston and Cardiff, are acting unilaterally, but cricket, and sport in general, is crying out for environmental leadership – how fabulous it would be if Thursday’s match banged heads together. With 2.5bn fans worldwide, cricket has the potential to influence human behaviour in profound ways.• This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

Keaton Jennings’ century helped put Lancashire on course for their first County Championship win of the season against Division One leaders Nottinghamshire. Jennings hit 21 fours on his way to 126 at Trent Bridge for his second-successive hundred as Lancashire posted 338 before reducing Notts to 106 for five in their second innings. Notts, bowled out for 133 first time around, lost their first three wickets for one run in their second innings before reaching 106 for five at the close, still 99 runs behind. Lancashire pair Graham Onions and James Anderson shared the wickets in an outstanding spell of new-ball bowling. Surrey batsman Ollie Pope hit a career-best 158 not out before rain ruined the second day of their match against Yorkshire at the Kia Oval. The 20-year-old’s third Championship century, in only his 10th first-class game, helped Surrey make 414 after they had resumed on 366 for seven, before they reduced Yorkshire to 40 for three. England captain Joe Root ended the day unbeaten on 14 with Yorkshire trailing by 374. England hopeful James Hildreth hit his 43rd first class century to put Somerset in a strong position against Hampshire at Taunton. The 33-year-old was unbeaten on 125 when bad light ended play, as his side posted 324 for seven in reply to Hampshire’s first-innings total of 231, a lead of 93. Craig Overton contributed 80. Hildreth played with customary freedom to record his 41st hundred for Somerset, made off 138 deliveries, with 13 boundaries. Joe Clarke also delivered a perfectly-timed message to the England selectors with another superb century for Worcestershire in their match against Essex at New Road. Clarke followed up his 157 against Surrey last week with his 11th first class hundred in only his 52nd match, which helped Worcestershire post 238 in reply to Essex’s first-innings score of 177. Essex reached 143 for four in their second innings to lead by 82 runs. Division Two leaders Warwickshire’s game against Northamptonshire at Edgbaston is hanging in the balance. Both sides are eyeing up victory, with Northants reaching 160 for seven in their second innings before bad light ended the second day 14 overs early to see the visitors lead by 151 with three wickets remaining. Leicestershire turned their Division Two match against Glamorgan on its head at the Fischer County Ground. Opener Paul Horton hit an aggressive 50, his third half-century of the season, before rain caused an early end with Leicestershire leading by 132 – on 119 for two – with eight second-innings wickets in hand. It was a remarkable turnaround as the visitors had begun the day on 82 without loss before being bowled out for 178 in reply to Leicestershire’s first-innings score of 191. At Lord’s, Middlesex reached 455 for eight against Gloucestershire before rain arrived 10 minutes before lunch and prevented any further play. Middlesex resumed on 356 for six, but only 26 overs were possible and they missed out on a fifth batting point. Durham’s Mark Wood provided England with some encouragement in his side’s match against Derbyshire at Derby. The fast bowler generated pace and movement and claimed the wicket of Wayne Madsen, but Derbyshire still finished on top. Matt Critchley (64) and Daryn Smit (45 not out) lifted the home side’s first-innings score to 427 as Durham trail by 312 after closing on 115 for two. In Canterbury, Kent, third in the table, lead second-placed Sussex by 159 after reaching 125 for four in their second innings in another rain-affected match. PAUpdated

Alastair Cook has just posted an unbeaten half-century. He is now 55 in Essex’s 92-1 against Worcestershire at New Road, where the champions now lead by 31. Looking around the grounds, it seems like rain or bad light has now intervened in the majority of them. They are still playing at New Road, though. 

5.20pm BST
17:20

… with only 21.4 overs bowled. Elsewhere, Jake Libby and Riki Wessels have steadied the ship for Notts, who are now 81-4 having been 24-4. They have 32 and 26 respectively and the hosts are still 124 behind. Essex are 58-0 second time around against Worcestershire at New Road, trailing by three. Alastair Cook is unbeaten in on 37 with seven boundaries. James Hildreth has an unbeaten century for Somerset, who are 275-6 and 44 ahead of Hampshire at Taunton.In Division Two, weather is affecting things at Lord’s – called off for the day between Middlesex and Gloucestershire – at Grace Road, where it is raining as Leicestershire lead Glamorgan by 132 with eight second-innings wickets in hand, and at Canterbury. Bad light has stopped play there, with Kent 125–4 second time around against Sussex and leading by 159. Leaders Warwickshire have the upper hand against Northamptonshire heading into the closing stages of day two. Northants are 130–5 second time around, leading by 121.

16:53

Vic MarksJames Hildreth has just registered his 43rd first class century with another elegant cut to the vacant third man boundary. He was dropped once on 24, a relatively easy chance to mid-wicket spilt by Fidel Edwards. Had the chance been held Somerset would have been 71-5. Hildreth’s hundred, his second of he season, took 138 balls and was punctuated by 13 fours. Somerset now have the initiative with Overton opening his shoulders at the other end: 260-5.Updated

Vic MarksI said there was no sign of Abbott. But that situation has changed. Quite heroically, he has resurfaced after tea and is gingerly making his way up to the wicket now. He is clearly not fully fit and the ball is 55 overs old; in his first two overs he has yielded 14 runs. But he’s giving it a go. Overton has sped to 58 and Somerset are about to take the lead.Updated

They can’t be far off calling things off for the day here at the Oval. It is still raining and there is already a lot of water on the covers. I can’t believe it will take anything less than an hour to clear up. 

3.59pm BST
15:59

Tea or approaching around the traps. It looks an intriguing clash between champions Essex (177) and Worcestershire (238) at New Road, where the champions have just started their second innings 61 runs in arrears. Alastair Cook is off the mark with an early boundary. Notts are 44-4 against Lancashire as they bid to avoid a two-day defeat at Trent Bridge. They are still come 160 runs behind.In Division Two, Durham are 32-0 in reply to Derbyshire’s 427 at the County Ground, while they are still off for rain at Lord’s between Middlesex (455-8 dec) and Gloucestershire. Kent are 58-2 second time around against Sussex at Canterbury, leading by 92, while Leicestershire are in a similar position against Glamorgan at Grace Road. They are 89-2 with a lead of 102. And, at Edgbaston, Northamptonshire are 64-2 against leaders Warwickshire, leading by 55.PS: still raining here at the Oval.

3.14pm BST
15:14

All happening at Trent Bridge. Having been bowled out for 338, taking a lead of 205, Lancashire reduced Notts to 1-3. Yes, you read that right! Jimmy Anderson forced Steven Mullaney to chop on six balls into the innings before Graham Onions bowled Chris Nash and trapped Ross Taylor lbw in as many balls. Samit Patel defended the hat-trick ball, however. A two-day finish, perhaps? No change here at the Oval.

2.57pm BST
14:57

Vic MarksAll was serenity at Taunton as Hildreth and Davies took the score to 131-4, whereupon Davies left the field alongside the physio. We gather that he has a “sore foot”. One of Somerset’s reserve keepers is not playing, Trescothick. Now Gregory has played on against Brad Wheal so its 134-5 and there is uncertainty when/if Davies will return. So far Hampshire have been able to rotate their three fit bowlers and this turnover of batsmen may give them fresh energy. Brad has good wheels, as they say. Updated

Another innings complete and a couple more not far behind in the last 20 minutes or so. In Division Two at Canterbury, Sussex have been bowled out for 181 in reply to Kent’s 215, and the hosts have just started their second innings. Leaders Warwickshire are 264-9 in reply to Northamptonshire’s 256 at Edgbaston, a lead of eight. Is there anything Henry Brookes can’t do? Wickets and now runs. He has 50 not out. In Division One, Lancashire are 336-9 against Notts. Their lead stands at 203 as Jimmy Anderson and Graham Onions face Stuart Broad and Luke Fletcher.Updated

2.17pm BST

Not surprisingly, it’s a similar weather story at Lord’s to the Oval, where rain has stopped play between Middlesex and Gloucestershire at Lord’s. Leicestershire have claimed a first-innings lead of 13 against Glamorgan at Grace Road; the visitors bowled out for 178 in reply to 191. India quick Varun Aaron with four wickets. 

1.54pm BST
13:54

Vic MarksSo far this match has been more memorable for Abell the bowler than the batsman. Just before lunch Abell was caught off a top-edged hook off Gareth Berg for a duck. It was a frenetic morning: six wickets, 119 runs and there is no sign that Hildreth and Davies are in a mind to grind away in the afternoon session. By the way, this is an excellent surface for cricket with encouragement for bowlers, but it’s still possible to play some shots. There is pace so that the nicks carry, which may explain why Gareth Berg opened the bowling after lunch with four slips and a gully to Davies.

1.30pm BST
13:30

Worcestershire are set for a first-innings lead against Essex at New Road, with them currently 161-5 in reply to 177. Joe Clarke is unbeaten on 61 and, like Keaton Jennings over at Trent Bridge, is chasing a second successive century after a big one here at the Oval last weekend. Lancashire have reached lunch at 281-7, a lead of 148 over Notts with Jennings unbeaten on 111. The visitors lost Jordan Clark just before the break to Jake Ball. Somerset have lost two more since Vic’s post and go into lunch at 86-4 against Hampshire (231) at Taunton.In Division Two, Derbyshire are 397-7 against Durham at the County Ground, with a quartet of half-centuries for Ben Slater, Wayne Madsen, Billy Godleman and Matt Critchley. A trio of low-scoring crackers at Canterbury, Grace Road and Edgbaston are joined by Middlesex’s 455-8 against Gloucestershire at Lord’s. Sussex are 118-5 in reply to Kent’s 215 – Matt Henry has four wicket – while Glamorgan are 148-7 in reply to Leicester’s 191. Leaders Warwickshire are 203-8 in reply to Northants 256. Meanwhile, here at the Oval, I have heard the odd whisper that this rain may be hanging around for the rest of the day. Fingers crossed, that does not happen.Updated

Lunch at the Oval has arrived 10 minutes early due to rain, with Yorkshire at 40-3. I suspect it may also delay us after lunch as well given the ground staff are covering the whole square. This weather is not entirely unexpected. We have been playing under overcast skies all morning. When play does resume, Joe Root will resume on 14, including a couple of boundaries – a square drive off Jade Dernbach, who he later dabbed through the slips to third-man.Updated

Vic MarksGreetings (belated) from Taunton. I’ve not missed a ball but have been distracted (old players’ dinner last night and there are still a few around, then lost my glasses). More importantly the game is moving on with some rapidity.Hampshire had an early morning flurry to be bowled out for 231 and Somerset are currently 68-2. Just as significant as the figures is an injury to Kyle Abbott, the South African seamer, who has left the field. Conditions were useful for him, but chasing a ball at mid-off he turned an ankle. He left the field immediately and has not been sighted since, a major blow to Hampshire.The ball is still swinging and two of Somerset’s youngsters have departed to fine deliveries. Eddie Byrom was bowled by Fidel Edwards and George Bartlett caught at slip off Brad Wheal. Matt Renshaw, who, I discover, when he opened his locker upon arrival at Taunton, found it bulging with sandpaper, has played some cracking shots – an uppercut six among them, has also had some luck; he was dropped on 15 behind the wicket and was very close to lbw against Edwards.If Somerset can occupy the crease for a while expect captain James Vince to do some bowling, hoping to emulate the heroics of Tom Abell on Friday. They do not appear to be set on crease occupation at the moment however. Renshaw and Hildreth are playing lots of shots … and he’s just been caught at slip off Berg for 36. It’s 71-3.Updated

At Trent Bridge, Keaton Jennings has his second successive Lancashire century having hit one in the draw against Somerset at Old Trafford last week. This one, a patient effort, looks highly likely that it will contribute to more for a Red Rose side still searching for their first win. In reply to Notts 133, he has helped them to 259-6. He is partnered at the crease by Jordan Clark, who has 29. The Lancashire lead is 126 and counting.Here, Che Pujara has just fallen to Sam Curran for 17, caught at second slip – low catch for Scott Borthwick. Yorkshire are 34-3 with Joe Root on nine and Harry Brook yet to get off the mark. Updated

Crikey, Joe Root is at the crease already. Alex Lees fell for a golden duck, caught at third slip off Jade Dernbach, before Adam Lyth (six) was trapped lbw by Sam Curran, leaving Yorkshire at 7-2 after four overs. To add to the drama, Che Pujara has just cut the first ball of the fifth over the slips for six. 13-2 now. 

11.56am BST
11:56

… as Amar Virdi is superbly caught at third slip by Jack Leaning off Tim Bresnan. Ollie Pope finishes unbeaten on 158.Elsewhere, a morning wicket for Stuart Broad at Trent Bridge, with Lancashire’s Dane Vilas caught and bowled. Keaton Jennings is 71 out of 196-5 in reply to 133. Hampshire have been bowled out for 231 at Taunton. They started the day eight down. In Division Two, there’s early trouble for leaders Warwickshire, who have lost two morning wickets and are 145-6 against Northants, who made 256. New Zealand’s Dough Bracewell has four wickets to go with 81.Updated

Yorkshire have struck in the opening 15 minutes to remove Conor McKerr for 29, ending a partnership of 81 with Ollie Pope for the eighth wicket. McKerr aimed a big booming drive at Tim Bresnan, only to see it scurry through to Adam Lyth at second slip. He couldn’t cling on to the catch but parried it up towards first slip, where Che Pujara dived to complete the catch. That wicket fell at 373, but Surrey are now 388-8 and Pope is on 145, equalling his career best.

… where it is dry but overcast ahead of day two between Surrey and Yorkshire. Day one didn’t always look like being a dominant day for the hosts, who turned things around courtesy of Ollie Pope’s unbeaten 131 – remember the name! The 20-year-old scored his third first-class hundred, his second this season, in just his 10th match and was helped out by contrasting half-centuries from watchful Dean Elgar and belligerent Rikki Clarke. Surrey were 69-4 and 162-6 either side of lunch before ending the day on 366-7, with Joe Root’s Yorkshire under the cosh.Pope will bat with the tail this morning and hopefully look to carry on a carefree approach which he adopted once passing three figures last night. A couple of milestones of note yesterday; 10,000 first-class runs for Clarke and 400 wickets for Jack Brooks. Both excellent performers over the years. Brooks’s milestone is made all the more impressive given he didn’t make his debut until mid-2009. Wickets tumbled around the country. Lancashire are in control against leaders Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in the battle of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. Anderson took two wickets in Notts 133 all out, but Broad is yet to strike in their reply of 157-4. Worcestershire are 47-0 against champions Essex at New Road, with the visitors bowled out for 177. Alastair Cook top-scored with 37 on a mixed day for England’s Test incumbents and hopefuls. James Vince hit 44 for Hampshire against Somerset at Taunton, where rain meant only 58.1 overs were bowled. Hampshire will begin day two on 158-8.In Division Two, Dawid Malan posted 76 for Middlesex against Gloucestershire at Lord’s, as did Eoin Morgan in a rare Championship appearance. Nick Gubbins made 99 in 356-6. After last weekend’s ‘snatch defeat from the jaws of victory’ act for Leicestershire against Durham at the Riverside, things are going from bad to worse at Grace Road. Glamorgan are 82-0 replying to 191.Ben Slater, Wayne Madsen and Billy Godleman hit fifties for Derbyshire in their 301-4 against Durham at Derby, while Kent and Sussex look to be involved in an intriguing low-scoring clash at Canterbury. Kent’s 215 plays Sussex’s 69-4. Kent’s New Zealand quick Matt Henry has continued his excellent start to the season with three wickets.Finally, leaders Warwickshire are 100-4 replying to Northamptonshire’s 256, a significant triumph having been 102-7. Steven Crook and Doug Bracewell their heroes with wickets and runs.Away from the county scene, fingers crossed for a successful day at Malahide, where Ireland have just got life as a Test nation under way against Pakistan following yesterday’s rain. They have won the toss and will bowl.Updated

cricket,"• ICC looking to reduce home advantage in Test championship• ECB warned counties and MCC could form breakaway body

Next summer’s Ashes series in England could be the first in 141 years of Test cricket to be played without the toss taking place as the International Cricket Council considers ways to reduce the impact of home advantage in its World Test Championship.England’s attempt to wrestle the urn back from Australia in 2019 is set to be the first series of the new nine-country competition . According to ESPNCricinfo, the ICC’s cricket committee will debate removing the toss when it meets in Mumbai at the end of May.The panel, which operates in an advisory capacity and can only make recommendations to the ICC chief executives’ committee, is due to consider whether the option to bat or bowl first should be given to the visiting captain to encourage fairer pitches.A similar tweak has been in place in the County Championship since 2016, whereby the away captain has the option to either bowl first or have the toss. This was brought in to cut down the number of green, seaming surfaces, which were felt to be promoting medium pace, hindering spinners and not replicating conditions encountered at Test level.The ICC cricket committee, chaired by India’s former spinner Anil Kumble, will also look to devise a points system for the Test championship in which the top nine teams play three series at home and three away over a two-year period – not all plays all – with the top two teams in the league contesting a showpiece final.Meanwhile, the England and Wales Cricket Board has been warned by the former Somerset chairman Andy Nash that the 18 first-class counties and Marylebone Cricket Club could form a breakaway body akin to football’s Premier League or rugby’s Premiership.Nash stood down as an ECB board director last month citing issues over the management style of its chairman, Colin Graves, and a belief that both the new 100-ball tournament and mooted compensation payments for Test grounds that miss out on hosting matches could “promote eight counties as the first among equals”.He told BBC Sport: “Unless trust is re-established in the national governing body by its principal 19 members, then it’s possible that the clubs may look at what has happened in football and rugby where they decide to form their own body within the auspices of the national governing body to represent their interests in a different way.”"
cricket,"Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes give their first-hand experience of playing alongside India’s biggest star

The last time an incumbent captain of India joined an English county side was in 2000, when Sourav Ganguly pitched up at Lancashire. The story goes that early on, such was their overseas signing’s attitude that he handed his batting partner, one Mike Atherton, his sweater during a break in play with orders to run it back to the dressing room.It’s a great line but, sadly, one that is apocryphal, or has at least been spun to such an extent that Muttiah Muralitharan would have been be proud. Atherton did briefly find himself holding said cable-knit while his team-mate made a sartorial adjustment but apparently no such instruction was given.Nevertheless, that such an embellishment followed is still symptomatic of Ganguly’s time at Old Trafford as a man apart. Andrew Flintoff said it was like having “Prince Charles” in the team, such was his regal demeanour. Ian Austin lamented the fact he “made no attempt to join in socially” and did not truly deliver with the bat after turning up believing “county cricket would be a doddle”.Others simply described a cricketer who was a little reserved – hardly a first – and worked his hours. Ganguly himself has since explained that long playing days meant drinking after stumps was not his thing, not least since his wife, Dona, was with him in Manchester and did not know many people. The Ganguly-Lancashire mismatch came to mind when The Spin began pondering the impending arrival of Virat Kohli at Surrey for his mutually beneficial month-long spell in June. The India captain, desperate to avoid a repeat of a 2014 horror show that yielded 138 runs in 10 innings against England, can adjust to conditions before the Tests in August, while the club and the County Championship will be swamped by an avalanche of stardust.Beyond the inevitable grumbles about English cricket pointing the blunderbuss to the foot of its own national team, what can his new team-mates expect from Kohli? Will he be rocking up and throwing his bats to Rikki Clarke for extra linseed oil, or ordering Sam Curran to fetch him 1,000 brown M&Ms to fill a brandy glass as a pre-condition of taking the field? After all, this is a cricketer with a combined social-media following of 83 million people, estimated annual earnings of £20m (thanks to deals with Puma, Tissot, Audi and Pepsi) and is one half of India’s leading power couple following his marriage to Bollywood’s Anuskha Sharma. Surrey have long had a reputation as the south London strutters who love a big-name signing, but Kohli surely tops the lot.To this end, The Spin enquired as to what is in store for the dressing room in SE11 by asking Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, two upstanding Brummies who have spent the past six weeks playing under Kohli for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League, for something of a character reference.“I know a few of the Surrey guys and they are not what people make them out to be a lot of the time. But if anyone in that dressing room does think they are a big dog, they will need to sit down for a little while because there is a proper big dog coming,” says Moeen with tongue is slightly in cheek.“You have your perceptions of someone like Virat, who is quite passionate, emotional, in your face and plays it hard,” explains Woakes. “But off the field he’s very calm and you can chat about anything. He’s very down to earth and for someone who has such huge pressures and public focus in India, to see him go about his business in this way quite refreshing.”Moeen adds: “You see him on the field and people might think he’s arrogant but it is the complete opposite. He’s so humble it is almost weird how nice he is. He’s the biggest name in India but will ring me to check I’m OK or ask if I fancy lunch. Sometimes a player will invite the squad to their house for a meal and it would be easy for him to say no. But he would always go. I can say with certainty that anyone who has a bad word doesn’t know the guy.”Though Kohli’s presence in county cricket will doubtless draw huge focus – no bad thing at a time when the English game is finally trying to break down barriers to entry for the South Asian community – it will still be a step down in intensity from the hothouse of India. Indeed AB de Villiers, another RCB team-mate, told The Spin he expects the 29-year-old to one day finish his career in England for this reason.Says Woakes: “In my first year of IPL I found as an overseas player you get a lot of attention walking through airports in India. But having him in the team – the No 1, the king – we’re almost irrelevant. It makes you realise what his life is like. So county cricket will be much more chilled and he’ll enjoy that. Playing at smaller grounds, that will be an experience too. Having spoken to him about it, he loves touring other countries – it’s a release.”When Surrey confirmed the deal, director of cricket Alec Stewart said one of the main benefits will be watching his off-field preparation – not least his dedication to fitness – with Woakes giving a glimpse of just what this means.“Around 30 minutes before the bus leaves for a match, he does what he calls a ‘priming session’ in the gym,” he says. “It’s like a short burst of Olympic weightlifting. It’s certainly different but it works for him. Overall, his fitness work is having a serious impact on the next generation of Indian players. He’s leaner, fitter, more agile than those before.” For Moeen, however, Kohli’s overriding impact on Surrey will probably be his drive: “When he crosses the line he just wants to win. But it’s winning with control, not win at all costs. They will see his passion for the game. It is unbelievable. “And the fact he’s coming in a day and age when people are trying to play as much T20 as they can, that sums him up – he’s just dedicated to improvement. The England series is big for him personally and he’s giving himself the best chance to succeed.”The latter point may leave some frustrated and the fact it means missing Afghanistan’s inaugural Test in India will irk others. But there is little question that county cricket is going to get an almighty jolt when Kohli arrives next month, not least to any “big dogs” in south London.• This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

Congratulations to CSK and commiserations to Sunrisers, particularly the wonderful pair of Kane Williamson and Rashid Khan. Thanks for your company, bye! 

6.12pm BST
18:12

After two years on the naughty step, CSK have won the IPL on their return. Shane Watson played the innings of his T20 life, maybe all his life, blitzing 117 from 57 balls. His last 109 runs came from 41 deliveries.

CSK WIN BY EIGHT WICKETS WITH NINE BALLS TO SPARE18.3 overs: Chennai Super Kings 181-2 (Watson 117, Rayudu 15) Rayudu slams four through the covers to complete an immense victory!Updated
at 7.12pm BST


6.08pm BST
18:08

18th over: Chennai Super Kings 177-2 (Watson 117, Rayudu 11) Watson takes CSK to within two of victory with two brutal straight drives for four off Kaul.

6.03pm BST
18:03

17th over: Chennai Super Kings 166-2 (Watson 108, Rayudu 10) That’s it! Watson limps a single off Rashid to reach an astonishing century: 51 balls, seven fours, eight sixes. And he took 11 balls to get off the mark! The milestone liberates him sufficiently to hit Rashid Khan’s last two balls for four. CSK are going to win at a canter.Updated
at 6.04pm BST


5.59pm BST
17:59

16th over: Chennai Super Kings 154-2 (Watson 98, Rayudu 8) So much for playing Kumar with respect. Rayudu has just Leatherfaced a short ball over long off for six. A single brings Watson on strike, and he steers a single to move to 98 and keep the strike. CSK need 25 from 24 balls.Updated
at 6.00pm BST


5.55pm BST
17:55

As Rob Key and Mark Butcher have just said on Sky Sports, CSK’s tactics have been excellent. Kumar and Rashid Khan, who have been played with respect, have bowled six overs for 22. The rest have bowled nine overs for 122.Updated
at 5.56pm BST


5.53pm BST
17:53

15th over: Chennai Super Kings 146-2 (Watson 97, Rayudu 2) Rashid Khan returns to the attack, and if he takes five wickets in an over this might just get interesting. Rayudu is happy to play out a testing over that includes a big appeal for LBW from a googly. It was given not out but Sunrisers had little choice but to gamble on a review. I thought it hit him outside the line, and replays confirm my eyesight is not quite as bad as I feared. Not out. CSK need 33 from 30 balls.

5.49pm BST
17:49

14th over: Chennai Super Kings 145-2 (Watson 97, Rayudu 1) Watson deflects Brathwaite to third man for four to move into the nineties, and then he pings a slower ball over midwicket for his eighth six! This is an utterly ridiculous innings. He had eight from 16 balls; now he has 97 from 48.

5.46pm BST
17:46

A scintilla of hope for Sunrisers. Brathwaite produces a nasty bouncer that Raina gloves through to Goswami, who takes an outstanding leaping catch. It’s given not out but Sunrisers review and Raina, who knows he’s gloved it, walks off long before the third umpire officially overturns the decision.Updated
at 5.48pm BST


5.42pm BST
17:42

13th over: Chennai Super Kings 131-1 (Watson 86, Raina 31) Sandeep Sharma returns in place of Shakib, whose first over went for 15. It’s much of a muchness to Watson, who smashes three consecutive sixes and 27 from the over! He can’t run so he’s blasting the ball to all parts. It’s a stunning display of hitting. He has smashed 78 from the last 29 balls, including seven sixes! CSK were cruising a minute ago; now they are doing whatever comes after cruising. They only need 48 from 42 balls.Updated
at 5.43pm BST


5.36pm BST
17:36

12th over: Chennai Super Kings 104-1 (Watson 60, Raina 31) Brathwaite comes into the attack. Watson tries to steal an overthrow and winces with pain; it looks like he’s pulled something. He can barely run - so he just drags Brathwaite into the leg side for four to bring up the hundred. CSK are cruising at the moment. They need 75 from 48 balls.“Evening Rob,” says James Lane. “Did you catch Michael Slater’s kurta-cleavage during the break? I’m still getting flashes.”I missed it as I went to get a coffee. It’s times like these when Catch Up TV really doesn’t come into its own.

5.33pm BST
17:33

11th over: Chennai Super Kings 95-1 (Watson 53, Raina 29) Watson brings up a brilliant, ballsy fifty by sweeping Shakib’s first ball of the innings for six. Watson made nought from 10 balls, eight from 16, but he kept his nerve and has bashed 43 off the last 17. Raina ends another great over for CSK with a sweet straight six. Sunrisers are in urgent need of a wicket or, failing that, a dot ball. “What are your thoughts about ECB’s new 100-ball format,” says Sahil Pandita. “Is it really required? What difference does 20 balls make?”It means the BBC can fit the games into a certain timeslot. It’s hard to see any other reason for it. That said, I’m not as against it as most people. T20 is a free-for-all in terms of innovation so yeah, do your worst. My main concern is what it means for poor old Statsguru.

5.28pm BST
17:28

10th over: Chennai Super Kings 80-1 (Watson 45, Raina 22) CSK are playing Rashid Khan with total respect, aiming for nothing grander than a single off every ball. They manage four off the first five deliveries – and then get some bonus runs when the last ball scuttles away for four leg byes. CSK need 99 from the last 10 overs. This is going to the last over, maybe to the last ball. 

5.23pm BST
17:23

9th over: Chennai Super Kings 72-1 (Watson 43, Raina 16) CSK are targeting Kaul. Watson monsters a straight six and slices a low full toss this far short of Rashid, charging in from deep point. The next ball is slower, picked and belted to long off for four. Watson, who made eight from his first 16 balls, has since made 35 from 14. And poor Kaul’s first two overs have gone for 16 apiece.Updated
at 5.42pm BST


5.15pm BST
17:15

8th over: Chennai Super Kings 56-1 (Watson 28, Raina 15) It’s time for Rashid Khan, the best T20 cricketer in the world. One way or another, his four overs will probably decide this match. Raina is a key man, having played Rashid well in the past. CSK play low-risk cricket throughout his first over, content to milk five singles. Well played.

5.10pm BST
17:10

7th over: Chennai Super Kings 51-1 (Watson 26, Raina 13) Kumar is replaced by Siddarth Kaul, whose second ball is flicked majestically for six by Watson. He slices the next delivery high over the off side, just short of Rashid Khan running in from the boundary. A brilliant over for CSK – 16 from it - continues when Raina helps two poor deliveries around the corner for four. CSK need 128 from 78 balls.Updated
at 5.12pm BST


5.05pm BST
17:05

6th over: Chennai Super Kings 35-1 (Watson 19, Raina 4) Sandeep Sharma also continues into a third over. Watson hammers him towards cow corner, where Rashid Khan saves three runs with the most nonchalant grab on the run as the ball bounces up. Watson eventually gets hold of one later in the over, clouting Sharma miles over midwicket for six. He follows that with four more and then Raina survives a run-out referral after a neat bit of footwork from Sharma. A desperate slide saved Raina. This is great stuff now.“Two weeks ago, my expectations of “Hamilton” were recklessly high - and, when I saw the show, surpassed,” says Gary Naylor. “On Tuesday, my expectations of Rashid Khan were recklessly high - and, when I saw the lad, surpassed. How lucky we are to be alive right now.”

4.59pm BST
16:59

5th over: Chennai Super Kings 20-1 (Watson 7, Raina 2) Kumar continues into his third over, with Williamson keen to ram home Sunrisers’ advantage. Four from the over. This is exquisitely tight, the atmospheric equivalent of Spandex trousers that are a size too small. Sunrisers would love to get rid of Raina before Rashid Khan comes into the attack. At the moment they won’t want to get rid of Shane Watson, who has struggled to seven from 15 balls.“Watson’s been a disgrace so far,” says Hari. “Think he’s tiring from a long tournament but he essentially got Faf out there through all those dots.”

4.55pm BST
16:55

4th over: Chennai Super Kings 16-1 (Watson 5, Raina 0) CSK need 163 from 16 overs.

4.54pm BST
16:54

A huge wicket for Sunrisers! Sandeep Sharma duped du Plessis with a fine slower ball that was toe-ended miles in the air. Sharma called for the catch himself and took it confidently.Updated
at 4.55pm BST


4.50pm BST
16:50

3rd over: Chennai Super Kings 10-0 (Watson 0, du Plessis 10) This is an extraordinary start from Kumar. He extends his sequence of dot balls to 10 (T-E-N) before du Plessis works the 11th to backward point for a single. Make that five singles: a narcissistic throw from Hoola flies to the boundary and gives CSK four bonus runs. Watson was easily home so that was not the brightest bit of cricket from Hoola.

4.44pm BST
16:44

2nd over: Chennai Super Kings 5-0 (Watson 0, du Plessis 5) Sandeep Sharma shares the new ball. His second ball is blasted through the covers for four by Faf du Plessis, Sunrisers’ nemesis five days ago. That aside it’s a harmless over for SRH. Shane Watson has nought from eight balls.

4.39pm BST
16:39

1st over: Chennai Super Kings 0-0 (Watson 0, du Plessis 0) Bhuvneshwar Kumar starts the innings with a brilliant maiden to Shane Watson. The first and last deliveries of the over were storming legcutter that beat the outside edge. That is a helluva tone to set for the innings. Updated
at 4.39pm BST


4.22pm BST
16:22

Innings break Sunrisers would surely have taken that total at the start, though they might regret scoring only 18 from the last two overs. I’d say they are slight favourites, particularly if Rashid Khan works his not inconsiderable magic. See you soon for the CSK innings. 

4.20pm BST
16:20

20th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 178-6 (Pathan 45) The last over, bowled by Thakur, goes for 10. He started very well, conceding four from the first four balls. Then Brathwaite clunked a pull down the ground for six, a ridiculous shot, before holing out off the final delivery of the innings. Chennai Super Kings needs 179 to win the 2018 IPL.Updated
at 4.20pm BST


4.13pm BST
16:13

19th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 168-5 (Pathan 42, Brathwaite 15) Ngidi bowls an outstanding penultimate over of the innings – only eight from it. And it would have been a lot better had Brathwaite not dumped the last delivery over wide long on for six. 

4.08pm BST
16:08

18th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 160-5 (Pathan 41, Brathwaite 8) What a shot from Carlos Brathwaite! His first ball a wide from Bravo; the second, the first legitimate delivery of his innings, was a slower one that he picked and redirected over long off for a huge six. Pick that out! Bravo’s last over goes for 16, including another vicious hit for four from Pathan, and he ends with nasty figures of 4-0-46-1.Updated
at 4.09pm BST


4.03pm BST
16:03

17th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 144-5 (Pathan 35, Brathwaite 0) That was the last ball of an over in which Pathan cuffed Ngidi down the ground for six more! This is an immense performance from the big man, who has scorched to 35 from 18 balls. “If Chennai lose this final it will be their fifth loss in an IPL final,” says Sahil Pandita. “I always wonder whether it is better to reach lots of finals and lose most of them or reach some and win all of them. The agony must be too much to handle.”I think I’d rather win three and lose five than win two and lose none – not only do you win one more, but the wins mean more because of the defeats.

Pathan survives a potential run out when Bravo fails to take the ball cleanly in his follow through – but Shakib goes next ball, clouting a low full toss to extra cover. He made a handy 23 from 15 balls, and we’re going to have a timeout.Updated

3.49pm BST
15:49

15th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 126-3 (Shakib 22, Pathan 21) The dangerous Pathan makes room to smack Sharma over extra cover for six, the highlight of another decent over for Sunrisers. They are inching towards a score that will be very competitive with their bowling attack.

3.47pm BST
15:47

14th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 117-3 (Shakib 20, Pathan 14) A short ball from Thakur is flashed square on the off side for four by Pathan, who looks in the mood today.

3.41pm BST
15:41

13th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 108-3 (Shakib 18, Pathan 7) The new batsman Yusuf Pathan glides Sharma for four to get off the mark. Though the dismissal of Williamson is a big blow, Sunrisers are still right in this game.“Dear Rob,” says Aditi Prabhudesai. “This is off topic but do you get much grief for not having a Twitter account? I sometimes wonder if I am a sane person since I am not given to much Tweeting.”I don’t really get any grief, only a smug sense of moral superiority and regular pangs of regret that I once had a Twitter account.

3.38pm BST
15:38

Williamson has gone! He is so angry with himself. He charged the first ball from Karn Sharma, who saw him coming and slipped it well wide of off stump. Williamson ran past the ball and MS Dhoni completed the stumping.Updated

3.36pm BST
15:36

12th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 101-2 (Williamson 47, Shakib 18) Sunrisers have defended some low totals in this year’s IPL, so they are pretty well placed at the moment – especially with Williamson anchoring the innings so immaculately. He smacks Bravo’s first two deliveries for four, a princely extra-cover drive followed by a fierce pull. Kevin Pietersen once said that talking to Andrew Strauss about the IPL was like trying to explain gangsta rap to the vicar. Watching Williamson play T20 is like seeing a classical musician try their hand at gangsta rap, and be absolutely brilliant at it.

3.31pm BST
15:31

11th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 90-2 (Williamson 37, Shakib 17) Oof, that was desperately close. Williamson, making room outside leg stump, sliced Jadeja just wide of the diving Ngidi at short third man. The ball raced away for four, and then Shakib muscled consecutive deliveries to leg for six and four. Seventeen from the over, and Shakib has 17 from seven balls.

3.26pm BST
15:26

10th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 73-2 (Williamson 32, Shakib 6) Chahar returns to bowl his final over, a good one that goes for only three. He ends with figures of 4-0-25-0.

3.21pm BST
15:21

9th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 70-2 (Williamson 30, Shakib 5)  A misfield from Watson helps the new batsman Shakib get off the mark with a boundary. Both sides will be fairly happy with this position. But so much depends on Williamson. Updated

Gone! Ravindra Jadeja strikes with his third ball, angling a delivery through Dhawan’s attempted slog sweep. That’s a really big wicket.Updated
at 4.43pm BST


3.14pm BST
15:14

8th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 62-1 (Dhawan 25, Williamson 28) Dwayne Bravo, a T20 superstar for over a decade, concedes only one run from his first four balls – but then Williamson smacks 10 off the last two balls of the over! He picked a slower ball and slapped it over extra cover for four; then, when Bravo slipped a low full toss towards leg stumps, Williamson lifted it high over long leg for six! He is playing beautifully. Of course he is; he always does.“It’s not just England’s frailties against spin that are a problem, but also their attitude,” says Aditi Prabhudesai. “For example, their insistence on playing biff bang bosh when the conditions are screaming for a measured approach. Their rigidity will cost them a knockout match in the World Cup for sure.”They were better in the winter, when they played sensibly to win lower-scoring games against Australia and New Zealand. It felt like a bit of a breakthrough, though we won’t really know until July 2019.

3.08pm BST
15:08

7th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 51-1 (Dhawan 24, Williamson 18) The legspinner Karn Sharma comes into the attack. Dhawan hoicks a flat, hard sweep for four to bring up the fifty for Sunrisers. He and Williamson are delivering yet again; after a slow start they’ve scored 34 from the last three overs. 

3.04pm BST

6th over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 42-1 (Dhawan 18, Williamson 16) Thakur replaces Ngidi and starts with a wide. His third legitimate delivery is smoked over long-on for six by Dhawan, which allows Sunrisers to milk singles for the rest of the over.“Looking at the performance of the English players in the IPL, it is quite clear that they struggle still against spin, especially the likes of Alex Hales and Jason Roy,” says Hari. “I think England are an unbelievable limited overs side in flat conditions but are definitely going to struggle when there is a bit in for the bowlers especially the tweakers.”The middle order are generally good players of spin. But yes, the flatter the better. I’ve a suspicion there will be a pitchgate (sic) during next year’s World Cup.

3rd over: Sunrisers Hyderabad 17-1 (Dhawan 8, Williamson 3) CSK have made a dominant start and look less nervous than Sunrisers, who can take only three singles from Chahar’s second over. “This live blog is a pleasant surprise!” says Don Mihsill. “One of the undertouted benefits of leagues like IPL, Big Bash etc is the opportunity it provides players from less prominent nations to develop their game by playing in pressure situations, with and against some of the best professionals going around. These chances were simply not available to an earlier era (the young Nepali leggie Lamichanne is another one;). For growing the game, these leagues are a powerful tool. They’re well marketed, pay well, scout for the best talent (irrespective of nationality). It also makes a talented youngster in a country where cricket may be the third, fourth or fifth sport, actively contemplate honing their skills. Afghanistan are due to play India in their debut test. Their bowling attack will include Mujib, Rashid and Nabi - all participants in the IPL. I’m guessing they won’t be overawed and will be quite used to Indian conditions.”Yes, agreed. I cannot wait to see how Rashid Khan gets on in Test cricket.

That’s a bit of a surprise, as it means Sunrisers’ superb bowling attack will know what total they have to defend. The toss was a minor shambles, with TV’s Sanjay Manjrekar not having a clue who won it. MS Dhoni and Kane Williamson managed to sort it out between them.

Hello. Let us give thanks to England: their generous acquiescence this morning means there is no Test match to cover, so we’re going to liveblog the IPL final instead. A match like this needs no introduction, and not only because I’ve been caught cold by the change of plan.

What’s an IPL anyway?
 Today’s matinee show has a simple pitch: it’s CSK’s veterans against Sunrisers’ innocents, most notably the wonderful Afghanistan legspinner Rashid Khan. He produced one of the great performances to beat KKR in the semi-final: he hit 34 from 10 balls (!) and then took three for 19 from his four overs. Rashid is part of the best bowling attack in the competition; CSK have the best batting line-up. They also have more experience and have already beaten Sunrisers three times in this year’s competition, although two of those were extremely tight.It’s too close to call - but call it we will, for the love of the game and being paid, so that we can buy bread ‘n’ spread. Our commentary starts with the toss at around 2pm BST.Updated

cricket,"Joe Root’s side have now been dismissed for under 250 in seven of the 14 Test innings they have played since September
Andy Bull at Lord's

Thu 24 May 2018 20.18 BST


Last modified on Thu 24 May 2018 23.18 BST

Seems new dawns last longer in the Arctic winter than they do in English cricket. At Lord’s their latest broke at around 3.30pm, when Jos Buttler walked out to join Ben Stokes in the middle, then set again 40 minutes later when Stokes was dismissed leg-before and Buttler was caught at second slip. By 4.30pm, England were all out for 184. They had lost six wickets for 35 runs in 63 balls. Sudden and short as it all was, the mayhem lasted long enough to make one thing clear – whatever was wrong with the team’s batting in the winter, it hasn’t been fixed in the spring.It was the seventh time England had been dismissed for under 250 in the 14 innings they have played since they were last at Lord’s, when they beat the West Indies here in September. So much for home comforts. The green, green grass here wasn’t any easier or more forgiving than the hard surfaces of Brisbane and Perth, or any of the other spots where they were routed last winter.The conditions were tricky, the ground damp, the air thick and muggy, closed over with grey cloud, and Pakistan’s attack, four men with the knack of moving the ball this way and that, was well suited to it.Alastair Cook, at least, played well for his 70, all clanking straight-drives and neat clips and flicks off his legs. He looked like a batsman who had his game in order. His top-order team-mates, though, all fell to rash attacking strokes and sloppy prods, bad shots to good balls. Joe Root was caught flashing at a wide ball, Mark Stoneman’s defence was picked apart by a straight one, Dawid Malan was caught off the edge of a dangling bat and Jonny Bairstow bowled by a fine delivery that beat him on the outside. So in came Stokes. He asserted himself by collaring some clumpy drives, brute-force thwacks through cover and down the ground.The meaty crack of Stokes’s bat is so unmistakable that you would likely pick the shots as his even with your eyes shut. It’s crash-bang-wallop batting. There were five fours in his first 24 runs, and then a hearty heave-ho six off Pakistan’s young spinner Shadab Khan. Cook was out in the over after, beaten, brilliantly, by Mohammad Amir. The shock and disappointment the English fans felt at his dismissal was tempered by the fact that it bought Buttler to the crease for the first time in Test cricket since England were thrashed by India at Chennai in December 2016.When Stokes came back into the one-day squad in February, Buttler said there was a “back-to-school feel” about the squad. And you could feel that here, too. There was a flush of childish excitement when they came together, an expectant clamour in the stands. The promise of Buttler and Stokes batting together is enough to justify even Lord’s asking prices. They must be as potent and preternaturally talented a pair as England have ever fielded together at No 6 and No 7.It was only a fortnight ago that Buttler and Stokes were batting at the Wankhede Stadium, for the Rajasthan Royals against the Mumbai Indians. The two of them have come straight from the IPL to Test cricket. Between them they have hardly had a sight of a red ball in nine months. Stokes has played two first-class games since September, England’s two Tests in New Zealand, and Buttler hasn’t played any at all. He has spent the winter playing white ball cricket for England and an assortment of T20 sides, Rajasthan, the Sydney Thunder, the Comilla Victorians. It showed.Buttler threw his bat hard at his very first ball, chopped it just past his stumps and scurried a quick single. He followed that with a paddle sweep off Khan, and then a pair of breathtaking shots for four, a rubber-wristed flick to mid-wicket and a vicious jab down the ground. It was brilliant while it lasted, which wasn’t long. In the second over after tea Stokes was startled to find himself out leg-before on review. Moments later Buttler was surprised to find he was caught. It’s likely been a long time since anyone set him a second slip. Asad Shafiq clung on to a shot that might have taken his head clean off if he had misjudged it.For all the talk about how England’s new national selector, Ed Smith, was going to use statistical analysis to inform his decisions, Buttler seems more like a gut pick. As if, just like every other English cricket lover, Smith believes that Buttler is so gifted that he can’t but succeed in Test cricket. Buttler says the last time he was in the Test team he made the mistake of thinking he had to play differently. He says Smith and Root have been encouraging him to treat Test and T20 cricket in the very same way. “Whatever colour the ball is,” he says, “I’ve just got to go and play …” Which sounds fine. In theory."

Colin Graves, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, has insisted its new 100-ball tournament will definitely go ahead in 2020 and is needed because the younger generation is “just not attracted” to the sport in its current guises.The ECB had appeared to be softening on the introduction of a fourth format during its conversations with the Professional Cricketers’ Association last week, telling the union it was “not set in stone” and just a “concept” following player concerns over the new eight-team competition’s move away from Twenty20.But Graves, speaking on Monday to the BBC, has hardened the governing body’s position on The Hundred – only the 10-ball over remains up for debate – and reiterated the assertion that the two-and-a-half-hour length for matches has not been dictated by the broadcasters. Asked if the 100-ball tournament was set in stone, despite a largely negative public response, Graves replied: “Yes, as far as we and the ECB board is concerned.”This statement from Graves prompted a response from the PCA chairman, Daryl Mitchell, who wrote on Twitter: “He should probably let [the ECB chief executive] Tom Harrison know then. That’s not what he told us last week!”It was Graves who two years ago described the existing T20 Blast played by the 18 first-class counties as “mediocre” compared to the Indian Premier League and Australia’s Big Bash League. In his latest offering the 70-year-old offered a similar verdict when he outlined why a new tournament is needed. “It is not attracting the audiences, if it was we would not have that issue,” Graves said.“The younger generation, whether you like it our not, are just not attracted to cricket. In all the work, surveys and research we have done, the younger generation want something different. They want more excitement, they want it shorter and simpler to understand. Those are the things we have learnt for this new competition and that is what we have to make it.”This came on the same day the ECB announced 50,000 children aged five to eight years old had signed up to its All Stars Cricket coaching programme – up 13,000 on the first year – while it should also be noted that in the T20 Blast last summer 900,000 tickets were sold, nearly treble the number of six years earlier.As well addressing The Hundred, Graves was asked about the controversial allocation of compensation payments to Test counties in years they miss out on staging a match, including the £2.5m given to Glamorgan for not applying to be a Test host during the major match allocation from 2020-24.This money has already appeared in the Welsh club’s accounts for 2017 but its allocation is now set to be reviewed by the Good Governance Institute at the request of the ECB. It was also queried by two senior directors, Andy Nash and Richardson Thompson, when they resigned from their positions before the board’s reorganisation this month.Graves said: “No payments have been made to counties at all, full stop. I floated an idea talking to four or five county chairmen, that would need to be agreed by the board to go any further. No payments have been made. No payments have been promised. End of conversation.”"

Somerset spinner Dom Bess will make his England debut in the first Test against Pakistan on Thursday. The England and Wales Cricket Board announced on their official Twitter account that Bess, who replaced injured county team-mate Jack Leach in a 12-man squad, will play at Lord’s.The 20-year-old has been given the nod after England opted to play a spinner, meaning pacemen Chris Woakes or Mark Wood are likely to miss out.Captain Joe Root said of Bess: “He seems really clear about what he wants to do in the game and how to approach this week, and that’s all you can ask for from someone making their debut.“I remember mine, you just want tomorrow to come around, to get your cap and get on with it. He’s approached the week really well and hopefully he can have a good start to what’s a good, long career.”A revamped England line-up will also feature Jos Buttler at seven as a specialist batsman, with Jonny Bairstow retaining the wicketkeeping gloves.Root said: “We want a side that covers as much as possible, that gives us the best options we can have in each department. Jos at seven can be an exciting and integral part of our batting unit, to take the game to the opposition from a position of strength and make it even stronger.“The way he approaches his white-ball cricket, I think a lot of that can cross over. He’s got a good brain, a lot of experience in white-ball cricket and this is an opportunity to do that in Test cricket.”Bairstow is adamant he can handle the pressure of moving up to No 5 in the batting order as Buttler slots in lower down.“You wouldn’t be playing at the highest level if you weren’t able to cope with the pressure,” he told Sky Sports News. “It comes with expectation as well.”England will be looking to bounce back from a disappointing winter in Australia and New Zealand and Bairstow said: “It was a struggle this winter but we’ve had chance to speak about it and work out ways to move forward. Our record at home is very good and we need people to be coming here and going, ‘OK, we’ve got a serious challenge on to win in England’.”"

It seems odd now but English people really did used to hate Pablo Picasso, godfather of cubism and the great all-format all-rounder of 20th century art. When Picasso died in 1973 Kingsley Amis wrote in a letter to Philip Larkin: “I see Pablo the piss-poor paint-pusher has fallen off the hooks at last.” Thirty years earlier Winston Churchill is said to have expressed a willingness to “kick him up the backside” if he saw Picasso walking down Whitehall. Evelyn Waugh went through a period of routinely signing off his letters “Death To Picasso!”Weird. Foreign. Improvisational. Both eyes on same side of face. This seems to have been the basic tone of the objections to Pablo the paint-pusher, who is, needless to say, still going pretty strong and is this year expected to break his own single-year record of $568m of piss-poor artworks sold.Indeed, looking back you wonder exactly what Winston and Kingers would have made of our own post-Picasso art world where experimentation with classical forms has given way to a generalised inanity. Nobody really knows what to put in these vast galleries anymore. Stuff made of dung, boring films, rooms full of bits of wood left on the floor. People just don’t have time any more to learn to draw like Da Vinci or Degas, who didn’t have mobile phones or television or anything else to do. It’s all so difficult. Just do a weird video.All of which is a roundabout way of getting on to AB De Villiers, whose retirement from all forms of international cricket this week aged 34 has been a source of sadness.You don’t need me to say how good he is here. You already know all about that because you’ve seen him play, and to see De Villiers bat even for a few minutes is to be transported into his place, the AB Zone, where this impossibly difficult, awkward sport suddenly becomes entirely natural, easy, a breeze.Even during one of those masterpieces of the AB years – fastest fifty, hundred and hundred and fifty in ODIs; slowest Test innings ever in pursuit of a draw in Delhi – the impression remains of a man essentially playing a backyard game, the kind of thing you might rig up with a tennis ball and an umbrella towards the end of an August bank holiday barbecue.The present tense is apt too. Just a couple of months ago De Villiers scored a remarkable Test hundred in Port Elizabeth, pulling and gliding Australia’s express bowlers with a bend of the knees, a nudge of the wrists. At times like these there even seems to be something unnaturally potent about the face of his bat, which never seems to have any marks on it, is rarely presented in anger, but which gleams with power like a huge shimmering vengeful slab of cheese.This has been the genius of De Villiers: making the impossible look simple.Watch him racking up that 31-ball hundred against West Indies and what strikes you is how much fun it looks, the whole thing pegged around the same basic movement, opening out his front foot to create that power-hitting base, and all the while holding in his head a picture of the angles, the spaces in the field, recalibrated minutely as the ball enters his arc.Somehow even in these moments AB has still felt like one of us, just a better version, Cricket Human 3.0. Again this is deceptive. I can remember sitting through one junior county age group training session where a room of earnestly frowning parents were told that their promising offspring should try as much as possible to be like AB, to be the complete sportsman, to develop transferable elite skills, as though this were something to reasonably aim for, and not just the trappings of an unrepeatably rare sporting talent. Come on little Johnny. Play hockey for England already.Break the 100m record. Leap backwards on to that fireplace, average human child.This is part of the Picasso element to AB. Aged 34 he remains the most innovative, flexible, multi-genre, super-modern batsman in cricket, brilliant in all the forms, a player who even in his dotage has seemed youthful, morning-fresh, always ahead of the curve.This probably shouldn’t be the case. De Villiers made his debut before T20 even existed. He has learned these skills on the job, becoming a genuine outlier only as he approached his 30s.He isn’t alone in this. Right now all the best white-ball batsmen tend to be of an age, to be players with a grounding in the pre-modern times. Virat Kohli made his debut in 2006, Kane Williamson a year later. Chris Gayle, the T20 Bradman, was playing straight and scoring Test double tons before the shortest form existed.Where are the next-gen geniuses to sweep aside these classically trained oldsters, batsmen able to bat out a nibbly day at Lord’s while also making the white-ball game up in front of them?There is a theory we have been blessed by that intersection of old and new in the last 15 years, the spectacle of those who grew up learning the orthodoxies being able to bring that to the new forms. Nobody breaks the rules quite like a classicist. Perhaps with AB we’ve had our Pablo, a player able to bestride and take the best from both worlds.No doubt this will be proved wrong. Talent keeps on coming. There will a wave beyond the new wave. But for AB it has been a distinct, and distinctly thrilling career, tracking step for step the most profound changes in cricket’s history through a space in time that won’t and can’t come again."

A sporting series of astonishing power, passion, tension and intensity was played out in New York this week. Baseball’s great traditional rivals, the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, played three games that each swung violently. Finally – while Britain slept on Friday morning – the Sox, having lost two, clung on breathlessly for a consolation win in the third.This was not the World Series, or anything like it. It was, in theory, a routine part of the regular fixture list barely one-fifth of the way through the season. These teams will reconvene at intervals throughout the long, customarily hot, summer. It just happens that they are currently the two most successful, as well as most resonant, teams in baseball. And, after this week’s events, they are tied for the lead in their division, the American League East, way ahead of all rivals.In the midst of this epic it was announced that the Sox and Yankees would get together again next year somewhere completely different – the London Stadium: to contest the first two major league games ever played in Europe, following previous excursions to Tokyo and Sydney.A crowd of 55,000 is expected, a full house for baseball purposes: only Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles can hold that many on the US circuit. And the matchmaking is inspired. These are the teams most likely to have expat adherents. and the ones Londoners are most likely to have heard of.Furthermore, baseball officials will be aware of British sports followers’ diminishing attention spans. And though the capacity is large, the playing area is not. This pairing – above all the Yankees’ giants from outer space, Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton – is the one most likely to produce home runs. Judge positively salivated when told the stadium’s hitter-friendly dimensions. “I’ve got to see it to believe it,” he said. Baseball scores rarely reach double figures, but these could get to rugby levels, if not quite cricket.Ah, cricket. That old thing. Apparently, the cricket season is also in progress, though few have noticed. The County Championship is close to its halfway stage, the week after its old-fashioned start-of-May opening, though after Monday it will close down completely for a month and will not resume with any conviction until the swallows start considering their exit strategy in late August.What will happen in the meantime? Buggered if I know. The Cricketer magazine’s 2018 fixtures wallchart has 21 different colour codings for different kinds of events, putting it way ahead of the London Underground map. And that’s before 2020, when the inmates who have taken charge of the asylum are planning something else entirely, playing a currently non-existent form of cricket between currently non-existent teams. And before 2021, when the bonkers World Test Championship is scheduled for Lord’s. The Cricketer will have to start reinventing the Pantone colour chart.Baseball has a Test match level of tactical profundity collapsed into three hoursI became obsessed with cricket when I was six years old. I now find it unfathomable. And if it has lost me, what effect is it having on everyone else? Not a lot seems to be the answer. In the four months since the Ashes, cricket has gained public attention in Britain just once: for the Australian ball-tampering scandal.The issue is not about whether cricket or baseball is inherently better. Cricket is more aesthetically pleasing, and has two extra dimensions: the significance of the surface, which matters little in baseball; and the under-appreciated concept of the draw. A one-sided baseball game, like a one-sided 50-over match, can be very tedious. And, until recently, cricket had better manners.What baseball does have is a Test match level of tactical profundity collapsed into three hours. And something else, the thing that cricket administrators seem incapable of understanding. It’s the narrative, stupids.The baseball season lasts at least six months, a full seven for the two sides that contest the World Series. Teams play an average of six games a week which allows a little time for transcontinental flights. They do not complain, since the rewards are mega. There are no distractions, except a minimal half-term for the All-Star Game in July. The strategies may be complex but the storyline is simple.What that means for me is that almost every morning from April to September I wake in deepest England to a phone message giving me the result of my adopted team, the St Louis Cardinals, and a little cheer or groan to start the day (more cheers than groans so far this year, thank you). Sometimes the Cards are on a gettable TV channel, so I try not to peek and watch the game as live later.I have always done the same, depending on the technology of the time, with my birth team, Northamptonshire. Even at boarding school, one could catch the lunchtime, teatime and close of play scores on the radio; get the details from next morning’s paper, and the tables and averages twice a week. But following sport is a habit. Over-complicate the story, as cricket has done to an insane extent, and the habit withers.No one reads 21 books at once. It is not a question whether literary novels are better than thrillers or five-day cricket better than one. You can only read one thing at a time.One-day cricket was a fantastic innovation: the 65-over game introduced in 1963 had scope for almost the full range of skills but with added urgency. Since then, we have gone from 65 overs to 60 to 50 to 40, up to 45 (briefly), and of course 20 and, coming soon to a stadium quite likely nowhere near you, 16.4. Destination: vanishing point.A new working party, the umpteenth, is about to look at a new structure for English domestic cricket. I would like a single county competition to encompass the different forms of the game. It is perfectly doable and offers huge advantages. So that can be ruled out. In any case everything will now be at the mercy of a new “independent” board of directors. Apart from Colin Graves and Tom Harrison, the two officials who have spent the last three years turning mess into shambles, I have never previously heard of any of them.Will baseball take over? Historically, it has flourished in the UK only in pockets: Hull had 80 teams in the 1940s and a different version flourished in Wales. And whereas the NFL, with its limited schedule, could easily put a team in London, for baseball it is a distant aspiration that could only become real when subsonic air travel is replaced by Harry Potter’s floo powder. And I have a sense that the British are losing their taste for all bat-on-ball games. They love novelty, though, so Sox-Yanks will do fine, unless it rains.I hope to be there. Deep in my heart I still cherish the cricketing god. But I attend church less frequently and, in quiet moments, have taken to humming Losing My Religion. Cricket has been subverted by false prophets and, indeed, false profits."

The story goes that when the Australian Cricket Board knocked back Kerry Packer in 1976, Packer told them: “there’s a little bit of the whore in all of us, gentlemen, so name your price”. That line came to mind early on in al-Jazeera’s new documentary, Cricket’s Match-Fixers, when its undercover journalist, David Harrison, meets the alleged match‑fixer, Aneel Munawar, for the first time. Harrison asks Munawar if he ever has problems arranging fixes. “Actually,” Munawar tells him, “if you have the money, you will do anything.” Harrison opens up a suitcase full of cash and says: “I need to know from you what you are going to do to get that money, to earn it.”It turns out that what Munawar is willing to do to get Harrison’s money is tell him stories about how he has fixed two Tests. He says he has arranged to have three English players score a certain number of runs in a 10-over section of the Test between England and India at Chennai in 2016, and two Australian players to do a similar thing in Australia’s Test against India at Ranchi in 2017. According to the documentary, Munawar told Harrison’s middle-man in advance roughly how many runs would be scored in those two passages of play, and his predictions were right both times.The precise details of who was batting, when the passages of play occurred, and exactly how many runs were scored, have all been redacted. Which makes it impossible to say whether Munawar’s “fixes” were anything other than crude lies and clever guesses about how those passages of the Tests were going to play out. It is not really clear who’s conning who here, or what Harrison’s suitcase full of money is actually paying for. He thinks it has bought information about a fix, but given that his whole shtick is to present himself as a rube with a suitcase of money to lose, he may just have paid for a pair of tall stories.England seemed completely baffled to find they had been dragged into this. “Ridiculous,” said Joe Root, “outrageous” said Trevor Bayliss. The England and Wales Cricket Board released an emphatic denial in which the chief executive, Tom Harrison, said: “There is nothing we have seen that would make us doubt any of our players in any way whatsoever.” Australia’s captain, Tim Paine, said they were “unsubstantiated claims” and, just like Harrison, the Cricket Australia chief executive, James Sutherland, questioned the credibility of the evidence. Rightly so, given that al-Jazeera bought it off a self-proclaimed crook. Best, as Root said, to “leave it to the people in charge to look after, because I’m sure it’s nothing”.The people in charge are the ICC’s Anti‑Corruption Unit. It is going to be busy, because al-Jazeera bundled Munawar’s allegations up with two others from another source, one involving a scheme to doctor pitches in Galle, and another to set up a private league in Dubai. Five former cricketers, three of them internationals, appear on screen in this section of the film.Two of them, Jeevantha Kulatunga – who insists he is innocent and is threatening legal action – and Tharindu Mendis, have already been suspended by Cricket Sri Lanka, and so has the curator at Galle.It has been clear for some time that fixers are now going after people on the periphery of the game. Groundstaff who earn so little but who have so much influence over the conditions are an obvious target. The curator at Pune in India was suspended for failing to report an approach after being caught in a sting just last October, and there have been problems at Galle in the past, too, when a previous curator was suspended for two years after failing to cooperate with an ACU investigation.It is not just groundstaff. Two umpires were banned by Sri Lanka in 2013 after they were caught promising to help fix matches, and just last year Zimbabwe Cricket banned the treasurer of a regional cricket association because a bookie had persuaded him to try and recruit players into fixing a game against West Indies.Then there is the business of the new private league in Dubai, which was never actually launched but was allegedly being designed with the sole aim of enabling the organisers to fix games. And again this fits with what we already know, in that the ACU launched an investigation into a private T20 league in the United Arab Emirates in January this year.The problem is these three strands of the al-Jazeera investigation seem to contradict each other. Because the very reason that fixers have started exploring other ways to fix games, by going after groundstaff and setting up entirely new leagues is precisely because the security around international players is so much tighter.Al-Jazeera presumably presented the three cases together because it wanted to build the impression that, as Harrison says, “match‑fixing in cricket is more widespread than ever”. Which is not true, but is at least a good reason for being in James Pycroft’s account of fixing in the Victorian era, from his book, The Cricket Field, which he wrote in 1854.“Matches were bought, and matches were sold,” a former player tells Pycroft. But then another contradicts this: “You will find some to persuade you this is true, but don’t believe it.” Pycroft found that no one really knew who to believe. There was just too much scuttlebutt and innuendo. “Many was the time I have been blamed for selling when as innocent as a babe,” a player tells him. “In those days, when so much money was on the matches, every man who lost his money would blame someone. Then, if A missed a catch, or B made no runs – and where’s the player whose hand is always in? – that man was called a rogue.”Cricket cannot afford to blithely dismiss any of al-Jazeera’s accusations, and the ACU will investigate them all, but Pycroft’s book is a good reminder that loose allegations can damage the game too."

Never mind The Hundred; English cricket is in dire need of any old hundred. The inability of England’s Test team to convert fifties into centuries has become one of their defining foibles. And it’s getting worse: 24% in 2016, 20% in 2017 and, so far in 2018, a pitiful 6%. An elite batting lineup – such as England in 2010‑11 – would be at around 40%. An even more perverse statistic is that since English cricket’s new dawn in the summer of 2015, the one-day international team have a much better conversion rate (27%) than the Test team (19%). Given the nature of one-day cricket – limited overs, the greater need to risk your wicket – that is pretty staggering, especially as many of the same players are in both batting lineups. Maybe England could try some unusual incentives: a knighthood for the next centurion; Advanced Hair Studio vouchers for players with a conversion rate in excess of 40%. They should certainly pick and pick and pick the brain of the England and Wales Cricket Board’s lead batting coach Graham Thorpe, who made heaps of pretty fifties in the first half of his Test career and plenty of clinical hundreds in the second. It is hard to see how England can improve without resolving such a fundamental problem. Every captain wants to build a team in their own image, but this probably is not what Joe Root had in mind.England started the summer with the medium-term aim of synchronising their Test performances at home and away. They certainly managed that at Lord’s. The crushing nature of that defeat has plunged them into an unexpected crisis that may necessitate a change of focus. If England lose the second Test against Pakistan at Headingley they will drop to No 7 in the ICC Test Championship, their lowest position since the rankings were introduced in 2003. The retrospective rankings show the last time England were as low as No 7 was, symbolically enough, December 1999. Myopia was a vice of English cricket in the 1990s but they may have to make a virtue of it in the next few months by going back to home specialists such as Chris Woakes and Moeen Ali. A disastrous summer would have such an effect on morale as to undermine any attempt to develop the side over time. There is plenty to love about Dom Bess, not least those infectious, eccentric interviews, but in the short term Moeen offers more in every currency. If England restore order this summer, the relatively easy winter tours to Sri Lanka and West Indies would enable them to open one eye to the future. They could also do away with the antiquated notion of a best XI. Rotation is the future, so why not make it the present? It would allow them to subtly flit between Woakes and Wood, Moeen and Bess, today and tomorrow. And by destigmatising the idea of a player being dropped, they would have scope to occasionally omit the core players who have become a bit too comfortable.It is surely no coincidence that all five of Jonny Bairstow’s Test hundreds have come in the first innings of the match – in other words, before he has kept wicket. England’s acceptance of Bairstow’s wish to stay as a keeper-batsman is weakening the team, especially now that Jos Buttler is back in the side. Bairstow is one of the few players with the capacity to score Test 150s, and you suspect he has not fully twigged how good he could be as a specialist batsman. He has such pride in his improved wicketkeeping that you can understand why he is so aggressively reluctant to give it up, and the potential effect on his morale means it is not a straightforward matter. Nor would it be an easy conversation, but England need to have it sooner rather than later: Bairstow’s pride has become a symbol of a dressing room in which too many players seem to get their own way.The Lord’s Test played out exactly as expected – except England and Pakistan swapped roles. Pakistan played with patience and discipline; England were the loose cannons, as they have been for the past few years. At this rate Pakistan may have to give up ownership of the word mercurial. For the rest of the summer England should probably play a bit more like England, especially with the bat. They are like the dog that keeps soiling the same rug, and have become symbols of a culture of instant gratification. They should be smarter in their shot selection, and maybe take a lesson from their own past. In the year 2037, a young cricket geek will look at the scorecard from the Oval Test of 2017 and see a typical Ben Stokes innings: 112 from 153 balls, with nine fours and nine sixes. In fact it was a masterpiece of what we are now contractually obliged to describe as game management: he made 22 from 51 balls in extremely tough conditions, then 57 from the next 84 as things got easier. Finally, when he was left with the tail, he exploded to hit 33 from the last 18 deliveries. In one knock Stokes played a Test match innings, a one-day innings and a Twenty20 innings. All of the England batsmen should have it on their laptops."

Jonny Bairstow will go into the first Test against Pakistan at Lord’s next week emboldened by a show of faith from England’s new national selector as he looks to replicate his Yorkshire role of top‑five batsman and wicketkeeper.As the only England batsman to score two Test centuries during the winter, getting Bairstow’s talents up the order was the starting point for Ed Smith’s first squad; a more public debate beforehand was whether another gloveman would unlock more runs from his blade.Smith and co have done so, as it happens, with Jos Buttler recalled at No 7. But such has been Bairstow’s fine work behind the stumps of late – and past county experience – that he will remain there, with England’s one‑day keeper the specialist batsman in this format.“I’m very proud to be asked to move up the order,” Bairstow said. “It means the people in charge have got the belief in you to go out and deliver. They are asking a little extra, saying: ‘We want you to do this, we trust you, we believe in you’ – and that’s what you want.“It’s something I’ve done for Yorkshire for a while, and occasionally you are back in the middle after being in the field for a lot of overs, but you have to deal with it – that’s why we do all the physical preparation. You are going to be tired at the end of a Test match no matter what.”Since the gloves were handed over by Buttler in Sharjah in 2015, the pair have played three Tests together in India where the same roles were allocated albeit chiefly due to the batting alternatives, Ben Duckett and Gary Ballance, having already been exhausted by this point.Bairstow, who compared it to their reversed roles in the 50-over side, is feeling no extra pressure. “I think there’s an understanding among all of us that anyone can keep wicket on any given day. But at the same time I’d like to think my keeping has gone from strength to strength, and that hard work doesn’t stop.“If I drop a chance I’m not going to be thinking: ‘Oh, blooming heck.’ I might be catching 500 to 600 balls in a day and, realistically, there are going to be half-chances that are bouncing in front of first slip and you have to dive across.“That’s why you do your practice – it might be that, out of the three out of 10 you’re not meant to take, you end up grabbing one of them.”Meanwhile NatWest has been unveiled as the title sponsor for the upcoming Test series, before Specsavers takes over for the visit of India in a deal that runs until 2019 and will see England versus Australia become “the Specsavers Ashes series”."

Banned cricketers David Warner and Cameron Bancroft will cover their own costs while playing in the NT’s Strike League, a limited-overs competition that will double as a stint of community service.Warner, who lost millions in contracts and endorsements following the ball-tampering scandal, will dip into his pockets to play one-day games on 21 and 22. Bancroft, who would currently be playing county cricket if not for a life-changing mistake, will work pro bono for the entire event that runs in Darwin from 1-29 July.“There’s no payment to any players in our competition. These two players are coming up here, looking after their own flights and accommodation,” NT Cricket chief executive Joel Morrison said. “We don’t lose sight of the fact that they’re up here because of the events in Cape Town. They made a big error in judgment and ultimately paid the price. They’ve also demonstrated a willingness to learn from their mistakes and move forward. We’re more than happy to support them on that journey. It’s great they can start it now, as opposed to waiting for summer.”The competition will serve as Bancroft’s return to competitive cricket. Warner is expected to join Steve Smith in making his comeback in Canada, where a new Twenty20 league starts on 28 June.“If that didn’t go ahead for any reason, that might open up extra dates. It’s fantastic for us he’s playing at least two games, on each of July 21 and 22,” Morrison said of Warner.Warner received a 12-month suspension from Cricket Australia for his role in the Cape Town cheating scandal, with the governing body painting the opener as the architect of a plan to illegally tamper with the ball.Bancroft, who carried out the ploy with a piece of sandpaper which he then tried to hide from umpires, was banned for nine months. The bans cover international cricket, while they’re also barred from representing their state or playing in the Big Bash League.“I’m really looking forward to playing in the Strike League,” Warner said in a statement. “I heard so much about the competition while I was in Darwin earlier this month that I’m keen to be part of it.”Warner’s first public appearance since a tearful press conference at the SCG came when he helped run cricket clinics in the NT. The disgraced trio were encouraged to play grade cricket by CA, while they must also undertake 100 hours of voluntary service in community cricket.“We have a great opportunity to have them playing with our players, but also engage with our communities,” Morrison said. “Help people learn from their mistakes. Grow the game, get out and deliver clinics with kids while they’re up here. They’re both more than happy to get involved.”"

Belinda Clark will discuss key issues at an International Cricket Council meeting in India next week after the former Australia captain was appointed onto the organisation’s influential cricket committee.Clark, Australia’s record holder for Test and ODI runs, was one of three changes confirmed by the ICC on Wednesday and will act as the women’s cricket representative on the panel. The ICC hall of fame member replaces England’s Clare Connor on the 15-strong committee that oversees the future direction of the game and is responsible for recommendations for change.New Zealand coach Mike Hesson replaces Darren Lehmann, whose position became vacant after he resigned in the wake of the ball tampering scandal, and Scotland captain Kyle Coetzer steps into the shoes of Kevin O’Brien as the associates representative.The committee chaired by former India captain and coach Anil Kumble will meet next week in Mumbai, discussing player behaviour, potentially scrapping the toss and other issues.Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every dayChief executive David Richardson confirmed the ICC would review its code of conduct and sanctions following the Cape Town cheating scandal, which came after a series of ugly incidents that marred the sport.Lehmann had been one of the most vocal supporters of a push to ditch the coin toss in Tests, proposing the visiting side be given the option of batting or bowling.The initiative is intended to reduce home-ground advantage, encouraging curators around the world to produce pitches that deliver a better balance between bat and ball."

When the game was as good as lost, England at last started to play as if they could win. They were 110 for six, still 69 runs behind, when Dom Bess joined Jos Buttler in the middle. The two of them batted right through the late afternoon, in the sunny lees of a hot summer day. Buttler is a man of peerless talent but the way Bess, a 20-year-old playing his first Test, made it all look so easy showed up just how poor England had been until he came to the crease. They put on 125 and the hours their partnership lasted were the first since Thursday morning in which England had any measure of control over the match.Good as they were, the lead is only 56 and they will have to be a lot better yet to make anyone forget how bad England could look in the past three days.A lot of dubious thinking goes on at Lord’s on the Saturday of a Test match. Something about it seems to lead people to make the most bizarre decisions. How else does one explain all the preposterous clobber people wear? The blazers with candy-cane stripes, the schoolboy caps, the scarlet slacks, all those men ferreting around in their wardrobes asking: “Darling, have you seen my red trousers? I reckon it’s just the day for them.”At tea none of this felt quite so questionable, though, as the idea that England might have turned their winter form around. At that point they were shaping up to lose by an innings to a team who had scored 363.Anyone who has been watching England for long has seen them be all sorts of awful and every shade of abject over the years. You might think, after all this time, that they had already run through the many ways a team can fail, that they had covered the entire spectrum of calamities and catastrophes. These past three days, though, have been something else, something new.They have played sickly, consumptive, cricket, out-batted, out-bowled, out-fielded, even though they are at home, in conditions that seemed almost tailormade to suit them – and had won the toss too. Given all that, their performance here was so much worse than any other at home, at least in recent memory, that even the old salts were left scratching their heads as they tried to find something similar to compare it to.There was nothing dramatic about it. England were not swept away in a spell of breathtaking bowling; they were not bamboozled by a spinner or blasted out by a quick; there were not any giddy, dizzy, dramatic batting collapses. Oh, Mohammad Amir bowled some wonderful deliveries, like the inswinger that beat Jonny Bairstow, and Mohammad Abbas held his line and length while he wobbled the ball this way and that, just like his mentor, Mohammad Asif, taught him to, back when they were playing for Sialkot a few years back. But it was not exactly like being worked over by Wasim and Waqar. Pakistan’s bowling was not insurmountably good. Bess, who has played all of 16 first-class games, mastered it easily enough.England were not batted out of the match, ground down by the relentless brilliance of the opposition’s best. Pakistan’s batsmen did not make a 70 between them, never mind a century. This is not, by Pakistan’s own standards, a strong or experienced team. In the past two years they have lost every Test they have played against Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka – which is why they are ranked seventh in the world. Only two of the side, Azhar Ali and Asad Shafiq, have played as many as 50 Tests. Alastair Cook has played more than their entire top six and so has James Anderson than their entire bowling attack. But Pakistan were pushed harder by the rookie Irish side in the Test at Malahide.Instead there was a listless drift, a slow, steady, slump towards stumps. Until Bess came out England looked, and played like a team lost deep in the doldrums. Whatever directions their head coach, Trevor Bayliss, is giving them, they have not yet led them out again. These were familiar failings. Even Joe Root, the one man in the top six who made it to fifty, fell before he got to his hundred – again.They needed a breath of fresh impetus from somewhere. Buttler had been picked to do exactly that. Bess, though, was no one’s idea of a hero. But he batted quite beautifully once he had settled and was pinging drives and pulls for four both sides of the wicket.One guesses, though, that for England that may be as good as it gets in this match. They will hope the two and a half days beforehand were the worst of it, too."

Here’s a quick bit of Mark Wood reaction, by way of parting gift:It was hard toil from our point of view. They just kept getting scores. One guy after another kept getting scores. We worked hard as a bowling group, at times we beat the bat a lot, but they’ve outbowled and outbatted us so far. A hard day, a hard day’s graft.

Mickey Arthur has a chat. He says “incredibly” a lot, and is very chirpy.It’s been a really good two days. We’re obviously incredibly happy. We know it’s not finished yet. Good two days, we’ll enjoy them, but the reality is we’ve still got plenty to do.As a unit we’ve worked incredibly hard on getting our lengths right. On the subcontinent the guys bowl a little bit shorter. At our camp we prepared really well. We had 10 days in Lahore before we cam out and that’s one of the things we worked incredibly hard on. We knew if we could get it swinging at those lengths we’d give ourselves a chance, and that’s what we set out to do.Preparation was good, but the execution from our bowlers was second to none. I couldn’t be prouder of them as a unit. We knew in these conditions if you could get balls in the right area there’s always something on offer. We just had to do that and do that well.Grant took his batting unit away. We had the bowling machine firing at them, the bowlers bowling at them, and we concentrated on playing the ball a lot later, on playing the ball under our arms. That hasn’t happened by accident, there’s been a hell of a lot of work gone into that.I was so impressed at the way as a unit we fought. We fought incredibly hard. Very handy lead. If we can get another 20, 25 and then do exactly what we did in the first innings - build some pressure, bowl the ball in the right area, and hopefully we can get something going again.

And that is it for day two. There were positives there for England: some good bowling, with the ball beating the bat on countless occasions and finding the edge quite a bit as well. But the catching was poor, some of the fielding patchy, and the wind of cricketing fortune just refused to blow their way.

6.32pm BST
18:32

110th over: Pakistan 350-8 (Amir 19, Abbas 0) Bess doesn’t take it. Instead Amir (who was in fact on strike) hits a lovely shot to sneak one final four into the day.

6.29pm BST
18:29

109th over: Pakistan 346-8 (Amir 15, Abbas 0) Stokes doesn’t get the wicket England need, or look particularly keen on actually doing so. One more over today, and this is a chance England need to take. Dominic Bess is the man they think will take it. Updated
at 6.31pm BST


6.25pm BST
18:25

108th over: Pakistan 345-8 (Amir 14, Abbas 0) Another edge flies safely away for four, this time just wide of gully. I’d love to know what the two teams’ edge-to-wicket ratio is. Then Amir hits the ball past mid-off, and it is eventually fielded a couple of feet from the rope. England will want to end the innings tonight, without giving Babar Azam the chance to recover from injury and have another bat in the morning.

6.20pm BST
18:20

107th over: Pakistan 338-8 (Amir 7, Abbas 0) In nine Test innings Abbas has an average of five and a high score of 4*. He has only once been out without scoring, mind, and he can stick around: there has been a 43-ball four and a 34-ball 1*.

6.16pm BST
18:16

106th over: Pakistan 337-8 (Amir 6, Abbas 0) It’s all happening now. Amir works the ball off his thigh, straight out the middle and away for four, a very fine shot, then another edge lands safe, bouncing a good yard in front of first slip, and then the wicket, all in a three-ball burst in the middle of Anderson’s over.

105th over: Pakistan 332-7 (Amir 1, Ali 0) Shadab reaches 50 in ugly style, going for a pull and top-edging high into the air. Bairstow is quick off the mark for this one, racing round towards square leg, but it lands just out of reach. It has been that kind of day. A few moments later Bairstow does have the ball in his gloves, and he barely had to move for that one.

6.00pm BST
18:00

103rd over: Pakistan 327-6 (Shadab 47, Amir 1) Root fields, goes down hard on his knee, collects the ball and comes up complaining of a sore right hand. I’m not sure quite how he hurt it, but he seems displeased.

5.56pm BST
17:56

102nd over: Pakistan 325-6 (Shadab 46, Amir 0) The wicket and the lights have got the crowd a bit more vocal, at least when Anderson is bowling. They get gradually quieter as the over progresses.

5.51pm BST
17:51

101st over: Pakistan 323-6 (Shadab 44, Amir 0) Now a misfield. Shadab tickles the ball to fine leg, where Stoneman gets a hand to it but instead of collecting it he inexplicably pushes it into the rope. Wood recovers from his annoyance to bowl a couple of fine deliveries at Amir, neither of which he manages to get any bat on, despite strenuous efforts to do so.

5.48pm BST
17:48

100th over: Pakistan 318-6 (Shadab 39, Amir 0) Anderson’s first delivery at Amir hits him hard in the pads, to loud cheers from the crowd, but the umpire shakes his head. Still, a wicket maiden. After three deliveries he had asked the umpire to check the ball; it passed the test, and a wicket fell immediately.

99th over: Pakistan 318-5 (Shadab 39, Faheem 37) This has been humbling for England. The bowlers have often bowled too short, when the batsmen err the ball keeps dropping safe and when it doesn’t, the fielders drop it anyway. Shadab thrumps the ball past mid-off for four.

5.36pm BST
17:36

98th over: Pakistan 309-5 (Shadab 31, Faheem 37) DROPPED! Anderson finds Shadab’s edge this time, and it zips low but straight to Cook at first slip, who has it in his fingers and then lets it out again! Then Shadab goes for a close single, retreats to his crease, Stokes goes through with his shy at the stumps which hits them and then flies away, and the batsmen take a free run.Updated
at 5.50pm BST


5.34pm BST
17:34

97th over: Pakistan 308-5 (Shadab 30, Faheem 37) Wood starts his over with a cracker of a delivery, which has Shadab squirming but doesn’t catch the edge. A single later Wood does get an edge, but the ball flies between a static Bairstow, who thought Cook at first slip should go for it, and Cook, who only goes when he realises Bairstow won’t. That was painful, and it becomes more so when the very next delivery if thumped through midwicket for four. Cook rewarded Bairstow with an evil glare. “It was Shadab and Faheem who ruined Ireland’s hopes in the Malahide Test match a fortnight ago with a partnership of 120,” notes Martin Gilbert. “Looks like they could be able to do the same to England here.”

5.28pm BST
17:28

96th over: Pakistan 299-5 (Shadab 29, Faheem 29) Anderson bowls. A leg bye follows.

5.24pm BST
17:24

95th over: Pakistan 298-5 (Shadab 29, Faheem 29) Shadab tries to work the ball down the leg side, but it goes straight past the bat and is caught by Bairstow, who appeals half-heartedly and is ignored. He totally mishits the next ball, which is in the air for a while but lands safe between mid-on and midwicket. One of the things England have lacked so far is luck. Faheem then pulls the final delivery for four, effortlessly, straight out of the middle of the bat.

5.18pm BST
17:18

94th over: Pakistan 291-5 (Shadab 26, Faheem 25) So that’s drinks, and an opportunity for England to discuss how to curtail one of the more comfortable periods of Pakistan’s innings. Will they get past option one (namely, complain to the umpires about the ball and hope they give you a more fun one)?

5.12pm BST
17:12

93rd over: Pakistan 287-5 (Shadab 23, Faheem 24) Wood returns, and Shadab gets a couple off the final delivery, which takes a leading edge but rolls away safely. “Is it ironic that in a match that England selected Buttler for lower order acceleration and a young spinner Bess, we are being shown how to do it by lower order dasher (Faheem) and possibly a young Shadab wrapping up the second innings?” wonders Sachin Paul. Sounds to me like proof that England got their selection just right. 

5.07pm BST
17:07

92nd over: Pakistan 285-5 (Shadab 21, Faheem 24) Faheem tries to pull Broad’s final delivery, gets only glove on it but it’ll do, the ball trundling to the fine leg boundary. Pakistan’s lead is thus extended to triple figures, currently standing at 101.

5.02pm BST
17:02

91st over: Pakistan 280-5 (Shadab 20, Faheem 20) An update on Babar, who apparently has not required an x-ray, and is quietly “managing his pain”.

4.58pm BST
16:58

90th over: Pakistan 276-5 (Shadab 19, Faheem 17) Pakistan are enjoying the new ball (well, except for Babar Azam, obviously). Shadab drives past gully for four, and sees out the remainder of Broad’s over comfortably. Updated

4.53pm BST
16:53

89th over: Pakistan 272-5 (Shadab 15, Faheem 17) So having given Stokes a bit of a go with the new ball, Root finally hands it to Anderson. And he elicits a lovely cover drive from Faheem, who is careering along well in excess of a run a ball.

4.49pm BST
16:49

88th over: Pakistan 268-5 (Shadab 15, Faheem 13) The ball flicks off Shadab’s pad and rumbles away for four. There follows an absolute cracker of a delivery from Broad, heading into Shadab and straightening to beat the bat, which by the end is nowhere near it. His only reward is a sheepish grin from the batsman.

4.45pm BST
16:45

87th over: Pakistan 264-5 (Shadab 15, Faheem 13) Faheem gets two boundaries, both sent to an unguarded third man. This is interesting, though I suppose Broad has yet to complete an English summer, and by the end of it he might be knackered enough to bring those averages back down again.Stuart Broad's average speed in 2018 is 136.5kph - that's the fastest he's ever managed in Test cricket. #ENGvPAK pic.twitter.com/1DFrmlC7j9

86th over: Pakistan 254-5 (Shadab 15, Faheem 3) Broad bowls full and Shadab punches it through cover for four, Root chasing gamely and launching a last-moment full-length superman dive in a vain attempt to cut it off. Four balls later he might have gone. His review was instant, though - presumably he’d felt some gentle contact.

85th over: Pakistan 250-5 (Shadab 11, Faheem 3) Babar was not wearing an arm guard - Faheem Ashraf resisted the urge to hurriedly strap some on before he replaced him - and arms are simply not made to withstand that kind of impact. If there’s no fracture there it is a miracle of evolution.

84.2 overs: Pakistan 246-5 (Babar 68, Shadab 10) Stokes bowls short, and Babar has no idea what to do about it. Instead of swaying backwards away from it he kind of half-crouches, putting his hands and his head precisely in the path of the ball, which then crashes into his left wrist. He goes down, clearly in pain, and is now receiving treatment (namely, an ice pack). Hence this mid-over update.Updated

84th over: Pakistan 245-5 (Babar 68, Shadab 9) That’s a fine over from Broad, without reward. Still, at least they didn’t score off it. Meanwhile, it’s Friday afternoon, it’s the cricket - there’s no way there’s tea in that mug. Champers at the very least, surely.

4.16pm BST
16:16

83rd over: Pakistan 245-5 (Babar 68, Shadab 9) Stokes continues, Shadab pushes through the covers for four, and then flicks the next delivery off his hip to deep square leg for a second helping.

4.12pm BST
16:12

82nd over: Pakistan 237-5 (Babar 68, Shadab 1) A nearly over from Broad, which comes close to a reward when Babar diverts the ball just past the stumps, with Broad doing a pre-emptive gleeful skip of potential joy, and even closer when the next delivery is edged wide of Stokes at third slip - it didn’t carry to the cordon anyway - and away for four.

81st over: Pakistan 232-5 (Babar 64, Shadab 0) England snaffle the new ball at the earliest opportunity, and give it to Ben Stokes. After free dot balls Babar tries to push one to mid on, outside edges, and gets away with it. Off it shoots, away for four.

79th over: Pakistan 227-4 (Babar 59, Ahmed 9) The new ball is due in two overs, it’s just before tea and England totally reorganise their field for Stokes’s last stab with the old nut. A helmet is brought on, Root pops it on and stands at short leg, and sends a few extra fielders to the boundary. Clearly, Stokes is going to bang it in and hope for the best. And this he does, several times. Sarfraz ducks under the first attempt, leaves the second and, with just one ball to go before tea, goes after the third! Mistake.

77th over: Pakistan 222-4 (Babar 59, Ahmed 4) Stokes bowls a harmless short, wide delivery at Babar, and the batsman tucks in. Four runs.

76th over: Pakistan 215-4 (Babar 54, Ahmed 2) Bess keeps going. He’s the most expensive of England’s bowlers, going for precisely 3.5 runs an over so far, but having tried to go for him this morning the batsmen have been more circumspect this afternoon. Still, no maidens in his 14 overs.

3.23pm BST
15:23

75th over: Pakistan 213-4 (Babar 52, Ahmed 2) Having stood at the other end while Stokes gave Babar a bit of a workout in his last over, Sarfraz is understandably cautious when it’s his turn to have a go. What results is the first maiden for 22 overs.Babar Azam is not really a candidate for this short-pitched barrage England are employing. Against quick bowling, he averages 10.66 against full length balls, 14.50 against in-between length balls - and 44.50 against short balls. #ENGvPAK pic.twitter.com/GVu56xpuCX

74th over: Pakistan 213-4 (Babar 52, Ahmed 2) That’s 50 for Babar, his half-century brought up with a nice cut for four. That’s his sixth Test 50, and he’s yet to get a century.

3.16pm BST
15:16

73rd over: Pakistan 209-4 (Babar 48, Ahmed 2) This is good stuff, Stokes getting one to move into the batsman, the next to move away, and the one after that to move in again. Babar swishes at the second and is lucky to get nothing on it, and gets a single off the last, but that was a fine half-over."

With Pakistan getting ready for the first Test on Thursday Azhar Ali believes they can take 20 England wickets at Lord’s.The opener, who hit 73 on Saturday, said: “Good bowlers always take advantage of early-summer conditions and we have good bowlers.” He added: “That’s the way we’re thinking. We want to play attacking cricket, we want to take 20 wickets. That’s why we are going with five bowlers and hopefully this side will do well.”Their main strike bowler, Mohammad Amir, was unavailable here, protecting the recurring knee injury which forced him to leave the field in the Test against Ireland last week.But the fact that his fellow opening bowler Mohammad Abbas, who took nine wickets in the Test against Ireland, picked up a solitary victim deep into the evening session while his fellow seamers Rahat Ali and Faheem Ashraf both went wicketless, indicates that the pitch at Lord’s is going to have to have spice in it for there to be a serious possibility of Pakistan bowling England out twice.Accurate and economical they may have been but penetrative they were not and on a flattish track only the leg-spinner Shadab Khan looked able to make inroads.Ali also said Pakistan are likely to be unchanged from their Test victory near Dublin last week.As preparations for their two-Test series against England go, taking three wickets in the first 72 overs against what amounted to a county second XI is unlikely to fill Pakistan with confidence. Yet Ali said: “Overall we’re happy with the preparation we’ve had and hopefully that will transfer to the Tests against England. Amir is fine. He bowled very well against Ireland and in the last couple of days he’s been doing his rehab and also some bowling and he’s quite comfortable.”On a cloudless morning it took the visitors almost an hour and three-quarters to prise out Leicestershire’s young openers, who had brought up the 50 before Shadab had Sam Evans leg-before on the back foot for 22.Harry Dearden had ground his way to 19 off 77 balls when a loose drive at a wide delivery from Saad Ali gave Fakhar Zaman a low catch at backward point.That was the sum of Pakistan’s success before lunch but they appeared more focused after the break. Ashraf bowled a lively, aggressive and accurate spell, during which he hit Ateeq Javid on the helmet, and Rahat also improved, but it was Shadab who caught the eye. The smiling teenager once again demonstrated the considerable potential of his variations, having Lewis Hill caught at mid-off and Aadil Ali dropped at cover, as well as a handful of respectable leg-before shouts turned down, though Leicestershire’s batsmen later reported his googly can be picked, both from the hand and because it is bowled with a slightly quicker action.Even so, wickets continued to elude the visitors. Javid went on to a half-century before retiring, and the shadows of the floodlight pylons were extending a long way across the pitch before Abbas had Tom Wells caught in the gully. Even then Tom Taylor hit him for four fours in five balls before the players shook hands.“It’s a team game and everybody will have to play a part,” said Azhar. “As a senior player I need to make sure I do what I can to build a platform so we have enough runs on the board to help the bowlers. It’s never easy to play in England. It’s always challenging but we are prepared to do our best. It’s a big opportunity, especially for the younger players.”"

Captain Tim Paine has dismissed allegations of fixing and Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland says there is no credible evidence linking Australian players to corruption after claims were made in a documentary against two unknown players.Al Jazeera aired the allegations on Sunday, shining the spotlight directly on last year’s drawn Test between Australia and India in Ranchi, as one of several to be questioned across the world.In the documentary, a criminal claims two unnamed Australian batsmen were paid to bat slowly during a period of play in the Test.“At this stage it’s unsubstantiated claims. We’re confident that none of our guys are involved in it,” Paine said. “As far as I’m concerned our players have got nothing to worry about. I’m really confident none of our players are involved.”Sutherland stressed there was no credible evidence linking any Australian players. Crucially, there is no time stamp on the footage, and there is no audio of any Australian player present in the documentary.There was also no way for fixers to know which two batsmen would be batting together at any time in a match.“Although not having been provided an opportunity to view the documentary or any raw footage, our long-standing position on these matters is that credible claims will be treated very seriously and fully investigated,” Sutherland said in a statement.“Cricket Australia will continue to fully co-operate with the ICC Anti-Corruption Unit in its review of the matter. Cricket Australia and the ICC take a zero-tolerance approach against anyone trying to compromise the integrity of the game.“Neither the ICC or Cricket Australia is aware of any credible evidence linking Australian players to corruption in the game.”The documentary is the same one that claimed pitches were doctored to achieve desired results at Galle International Stadium in Sri Lanka. Australia were heavily beaten by 229 runs inside three days in 2016 at the coastal ground.It is understood Cricket Australia had contacted players last week to alert them of the allegations."

Mark Wood feels ready to crank up the pace at Lord’s this coming week should the instruction come from Joe Root. But the long-term aim is still to become a bowler for all seasons and one who lives up to some as yet unfulfilled hype in Test cricket.Unless an emerald green pitch is rolled out at Lord’s when England take on Pakistan from Thursday, and makes the uncapped spin of Dom Bess as redundant as an Argos catalogue in Ikea, then the chief talking point will be whether it is Wood or Chris Woakes – who took 11 wickets in the same fixture two years ago – who gets the final spot. Though Wood is the incumbent, having replaced Woakes for the final Test of the winter in Christchurch, Root and the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, will still take a view based on the surface. Grassy, and the Warwickshire bowler could win his spot back; dry with potential for reverse later on, and it is over to Durham’s fast but slightly fragile right-armer.Asked during the launch of the new England kits where his pace is currently, Wood replies: “That’s a question for the speed gun. There’s times I can bowl quickly and times I know I can but don’t like to force it because I’ll leak runs. It depends what the captain wants – if he wants me to rev it up then I’m happy to do that.“I want to be a bowler for all conditions. But I’d certainly be happy if they said Woakes, Jake Ball or whoever is more suited to a pitch – I wouldn’t have a problem. More than anything I want the team to do well. Hopefully I can bring something else when conditions aren’t like that, where it’s drier, reverses or a slower pitch.”Such skills came to the fore during Wood’s first county match of the season when, having called time early on a bench-warming spell in the Indian Premier League with Chennai Super Kings, he used similar conditions to claim a career-best six for 46 in Durham’s run-soaked draw at Derbyshire, which finished on Monday. His dismissal of Wayne Madsen, caught behind failing to evade a searing short ball from around the wicket, was his personal favourite and demonstrated why England have persisted for three years.With 28 wickets at 41 from 11 Tests, the 28-year-old accepts that while injuries are a factor, the Test-watching public are yet to see his best. “I need to get more wickets, I need to be more consistent,” says Wood. “To be honest I’ve got a lot to prove to the selectors, coaches, media, the fans because I’m a guy people probably had high hopes for and I’ve not done it consistently enough. An average of 40 is pretty average to be honest and I definitely want to lower that.“I’ve got a point to prove to myself that I am good enough to do it at that level. Am I really as good as I think I am? Am I as good as the commentators, selectors think I am? Can I live up to that? I’ve got a long way to go.”Such honesty is one of Wood’s endearing qualities, as is the drive to succeed at Test level in an era when, as a fast bowler with a back story of injuries and operations, he could easily jump on the Twenty20 train as a white-ball specialist.The reason why not? “When I was in the back garden as a kid it was never T20 or 50-over, it was Test matches. In my mind all the best players were at Test level and that’s what I wanted to strive to. These days, the 50- and 20-over stuff is a huge part of the game so I’m delighted to be part of such a good team.“But the pinnacle for me is still trying to get into that Test side and I think I have a real point to prove.”"

Ireland came up short in their bid to pull off a miracle in Malahide as they were beaten by five wickets in an enthralling inaugural Test with Pakistan. Hopes of an unlikely home victory were raised on the final day when the tourists, chasing 160, crashed to 14 for three, but half-centuries from Imam-ul-Haq and Babar Azam helped Pakistan home ahead of their meeting with England at Lord’s next week.The result had appeared to be a foregone conclusion on Sunday when Pakistan made Ireland follow on with a 180-run lead, but Kevin O’Brien’s century guided the hosts to 339 second time around. That knock ended on 118 to his first ball on Tuesday and despite further fireworks early in Pakistan’s innings, Ireland were unable to record what would have been only the fourth win in Test history for a side following on.As Pakistan warmed up on the final morning, they could hear Daniel Powter’s Bad Day playing, but if it was meant to be psychological warfare it did not work as Mohammad Abbas took the final three Irish wickets within 40 minutes. O’Brien, who had been pivotal to Ireland’s fightback on Monday, fell to his first ball of the day chasing a wider delivery and nicking to slip.Boyd Rankin and Tyrone Kane soon followed, both bowled by Abbas, who returned five for 66 in the innings, and nine for 110 in the match, as Ireland added just 20 to their overnight score. The 160 target was still enough to make the chase intriguing and the drama grew once Tim Murtagh and Rankin made early inroads.Azhar Ali’s tactic of dancing down to Murtagh proved short-lived as a shaped delivery did for him and he edged through to first slip from the innings’ fourth ball. Pakistan then slipped to 13 for two for the second time in the match when Haris Sohail attempted one drive too many and picked out Ed Joyce at gully off Rankin.And when Murtagh struck again, bowling Asad Shafiq through the gate, Ireland sensed a stunning success. Only England in 1894 and 1981, and India in 2001, had won a Test after following on, and no country had won their inaugural fixture in the longest format since Australia won the first Test match in 1877.The 11th Test nation’s optimism began to dissipate with Imam and Azam at the crease, though the former was fortunate an edge dropped short off Murtagh and the latter was almost undone by a Rankin yorker. Imam, in particular, looked at ease and was scampering between the wickets – a trait his uncle Inzamam-ul-Haq was not renowned for during his career – as Pakistan reached lunch 52 for three, needing 108 more.Ireland could not afford any missed opportunities and Andrew Balbirnie, who got a pair with the bat, endured another moment to forget at third slip when he put down Azam from his first ball faced in the second session. With the threat of rain to come later in the day, Pakistan sensed the need to accelerate against attacking Irish fields and Imam soon moved to his maiden 50 before Azam progressed to his fifth.Balbirnie at least had some reason to remember this match fondly when his throw back to Stuart Thompson at the non-striker’s end ran out Azam on 59. Thompson then pinned Sarfraz Ahmed in front but Pakistan got over the line prior to tea, with Imam unbeaten on 74."

The rise of Dom Bess has been staggeringly swift. On Thursday, if the sun keeps shining, he will, at the age of 20, become a Test cricketer after playing only 16 first-class matches in his life. Yet two or three weeks ago he was pondering whether it might be a good idea to see if he could go out on loan from Somerset as there was little incentive for any county side to play two spinners so early in the season and his friend, Jack Leach, England’s most recent debutant, was occupying that slot in the Somerset team.Now, after Leach’s unfortunate injury, Bess is among the glitterati at Lord’s. He is suddenly hot property, though I am unable to confirm that he already has a sponsorship deal with Ikea. He might have earned one since it became public knowledge to the millions of cricket followers out there (I take a more optimistic view than the ECB’s chairman) that he was in the brand new Exeter store looking for furniture when Ed Smith rang him with the news of his selection last week.It would be remarkable if Bess, so callow in cricketing experience, had a major impact at Lord’s. But don’t count it out. In September 2016 he was catapulted into the Somerset side to make a Championship debut against Warwickshire. The ball was spinning but even so it was stunning that his first two victims in successive deliveries were Jonathan Trott and Ian Bell. He finished with six for 28 from 16 overs and added two more for good measure in the second innings. In March, in his first game for the MCC in Bridgetown, Barbados, he took eight wickets against Essex and knocked up a rapid century. Does he not realise what a difficult, tortuous game this is?Charlie Gabbitass, Bess’s cricket coach at Blundell’s School in Tiverton, Devon, suggests that he doesn’t. “Dom does not overthink things,” he says. “He just gets on with it. Give him an opportunity and he’ll embrace it. At Lord’s on Thursday I expect him to be thinking, ‘Right, I want to get five wickets here.’”Even so, Gabbitass acknowledges that Bess was not an especially precocious schoolboy cricketer. “He came to us from a local primary school, a podgy boy from Sidmouth and he took a bit of time to adjust but on the games field he always had confidence. Early on it became apparent he had the ability to spin the ball – he’s got big hands he can wrap around the ball – and he could instinctively bowl at different paces without changing his action. Playing rugby helped him, I’m sure.“He was never hot-housed. It got him fitter and he enjoyed it, moving from hooker into the backs. He had an insatiable appetite to learn and take on board advice. And he was a humble boy with a good feel for the game when he was captain.”One indication that young Dom was not a child prodigy is that he felt it necessary to move clubs to progress. The Bess family hail from Sidmouth, where several of Dom’s cousins still play cricket on a famous old ground overlooking the sea, but with the prompting of Gabbitass, Bess decided at the age of 16 to move to Exeter CC, where he would be guaranteed more bowling. He attended the Somerset Academy while still at Blundell’s before becoming a beneficiary of the club’s decision to play on some spinning surfaces at Taunton.In part this explains his astonishing success as a young spinner. In 16 matches he has 63 wickets at 22.49 apiece; as a batsman he is not technically perfect but he has a good eye, natural ability to time the ball and a batting average of 25, which could easily improve. He may have to learn how to bowl on flat pitches in Test cricket – but he won’t worry too much about that.His uncomplicated zest for the game shines through. Unsolicited, Paul Farbrace, England’s assistant coach, mentioned how impressed he was by Bess when he joined up with the England squad last summer. It was not so much his batting and bowling that made an impression; it was his guileless eagerness to get stuck in to whatever they were doing (he can play football, too), however exalted those around him were. Bess does not like to sit still for long. He buzzes in the field, bristles with the bat and instinctively hunts for wickets.He is, of course, incredibly raw but so far seems to have made that an asset; he does not waste time contemplating the pitfalls ahead. He has never played at Lord’s, though he was in the squad when Somerset were there last year – apparently this was his first, wide-eyed trip to the capital.Back in the West Country there will be a host of well-wishers for the most endearing of cricketers on Thursday. Another Blundell’s teacher, Amy Candler, who was rather more concerned with Bess’s academic progress than his cricket coach, speaks warmly of his “grit and determination to make the best of himself. We’re all absolutely thrilled by his call-up”. So they are at Taunton, even though they are fast running out of spinners there."

Virat Kohli will not be playing for Surrey this season after the India captain saw his keenly anticipated spell at the club cancelled because of injury.India’s five-Test series in England later in the summer – and Kohli’s struggles against the moving Dukes ball on his previous tour of the country in 2014 – had led him to set up a month-long stint at the county that was due to begin on 1 June. But now the Board of Control for Cricket in India has confirmed that the 29-year-old is struggling with a neck injury sustained during his recent Indian Premier League campaign and will instead undertake his rehabilitation at home.The board’s statement read: “Team India Captain Mr Virat Kohli suffered a neck injury while fielding during Match 51 of the VIVO IPL between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Sunrisers Hyderabad on 17th May 2018 at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru.“Mr Kohli, who was scheduled to play for Surrey CCC in the month of June, has been ruled out from participating. The Team India captain will now undergo a period of rehabilitation under the supervision of the BCCI Medical team.“He will begin training and subsequently undergo a fitness test at the NCA in Bengaluru from June 15. The BCCI Medical Team is confident that Mr Kohli will regain full fitness ahead of India’s upcoming tours to Ireland and England.”Though England’s bowlers will doubtless be buoyed by the news that the world’s premier all-format batsman will have less time to acclimatise to conditions, it is a blow for Surrey and indeed county cricket itself given the excitement surrounding the deal.Kohli, who scored just 138 runs in 10 Test innings in England four years ago, was due to begin his time playing in the 50-over Royal London Cup, starting away to Kent at Beckenham on 1 June, before three County Championship fixtures at Hampshire’s Ageas Bowl, against Somerset at Guildford and then away to Yorkshire in Scarborough.India are due to begin their tour with two Twenty20s in Ireland from 14 June. They will then cross the Irish Sea for three more T20s against England and then three one-day internationals, before the marquee five-Test series gets underway at Edgbaston on 1 August."

Andrew Strauss is to take a summer-long break from his role as director of England cricket with Andy Flower stepping into the breach as a temporary replacement.The former England captain’s wife, Ruth, was diagnosed with cancer last December and is due to begin a new treatment at the end of this week. With that in mind, Strauss has been granted a period of compassionate leave to offer his full support.Strauss, who was appointed three years ago, said: “Andy Flower is going to be stepping in for me over the course of the summer. We all know about his qualities and his experience of both England and English cricket and he will fill in my shoes very adequately.“ I look forward to returning and grabbing the reins again but at this period of time my focus has to be on supporting Ruth and my family at a challenging time for us.”Since standing down as England’s Test team director after the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash Flower has been operating in a number of roles behind the scenes, first as the head of elite coaching before taking over as head coach of the Lions set-up.Strauss has continued his running of the senior England teams during the early stages of his wife’s diagnosis and has recently introduced a new selection system, with Ed Smith taking charge of the panel and now six new scouting roles handed to Marcus Trescothick, Glen Chapple, Steve Rhodes, Richard Dawson, Chris Read and James Taylor.“They will be compiling reports on players of interest to us,” said Strauss. “But they won’t compile reports on their own players, if they are involved in a county. It is just formalising a process that has been going on in a more ad hoc manner for a long time.On the new approach he added: “The idea is for us to get better information on all the players in county cricket. This is not what some people think it is, around loads of data and statistics. This is about getting qualitative information on what England’s needs are.”"

Yes, it was going to be difficult in the first couple of hours but but we just didn’t bat well enough. We simply keep making the same mistakes. We have seen these guys score runs in difficult conditions but we have to do it more often.” On the slip cordon chopping and changing, Bayliss acknowledged the issue. “We haven’t fielded well in the slips,” he said. “It is a bit like the rest of our play, we have a good game then a bad one. We need someone to field at short leg. Cookie is probably our best short leg to the quicks. Rooty has had a go in there this week.” Scrappy.

Instead, they lost four wickets in seven balls to leave just Pakistan 64 to win, which they knocked off in 76 deliveries. “Absolutely walloped,” says Phil Tufnell on TMS. “I can’t remember them playing so badly.”

Haris Sohail finishes it in style, popping a full toss from Bess into the grandstand then two balls later clipping him through midwicket for four to win the game! Pakistan 66-1 (Imam 18, Haris 39) Updated

12:27

12th over: Pakistan 56-1 (Imam 18, Haris 29) Joe Root at silly point on his hands and knees as though he’s striving for the final wicket late on day five. A short leg also there, a leg gully too. No surprises where Wood is directing his attack at Imam, then. In saying that, Wood is fuller this over than the two that came before it. Runs from three of the six deliveries around the field. Both teams happy for this to finish asap. Eight to win.

12.25pm BST
12:25

11th over: Pakistan 50-1 (Imam 13, Haris 28) Haris Sohail looking fantastic here. It is a shame that his day is nearly done. Admittedly, the first of his two boundaries this over was a case of putting away a Bess full toss. No issues with that. The second required real skill, bisecting the two men in the covers after getting to the pitch. Spot on. 14 to win.

12.22pm BST
12:22

10th over: Pakistan 42-1 (Imam 13, Haris 20) Wood sends down a maiden to Imam to slow the Pakistan chase, if briefly. He is really banging it in short of a length as his stock delivery, changing it up with a couple of bouncers. No issues for the opener.😂 When you ring the 5 minute bell but then have to get to the pitch for the team photo...🏃‍♂️ @AzharMahmood11 ¢LoveLords#ENGvPAK pic.twitter.com/iTXL6h5l58

12:20

9th over: Pakistan 42-1 (Imam 13, Haris 20) Haris into the 20s with another lovely drive through cover, off Bess this time. He looked fantastic in the first innings, before getting out. A nice red inker here will give him plenty of confidence going into Headingley. Not far away now, 22 more required for a famous Pakistani victory.A little factoid here from the BBC: “The last time England lost the first Test of a summer, regardless of what month it began, was in 1995 against West Indies.”Updated

12.16pm BST
12:16

8th over: Pakistan 36-1 (Imam 13, Haris 14) Mark Wood getting a chance now in place of Broad. Bowled with excellent pace first time around and immediately into his work here, short to Haris who ducks. When Imam gets down there, he gives him a bumper to begin as well. Fair enough. And then again to finish, trying to leave a bruise by aiming at his body. 

12.10pm BST
12:10

7th over: Pakistan 35-1 (Imam 13, Haris 13) Dom Bess on for a twist and I think that’s a good shout from Root. If the debutant can get his first wicket in Test cricket before this is finished, that won’t be for nothing ahead of next week. He is very close with his third ball of doing just that, Imam throwing his hands and missing everything. Loose shot from a ball that had plenty of air. I’ve liked that from Bess, giving the ball a chance to turn from the outset. Frustratingly, his misses his line next up and Imam tickles a four fine. Gosh, then some big spin out of the footmarks that beats Imam and Bairstow (and Stokes), adding three more runs to the sundries column. Bowled. 

12.05pm BST
12:05

6th over: Pakistan 27-1 (Imam 12, Haris 9) Forget about that extra half an hour, they’re ticking over nicely here with a couple of boundaries for Haris in this Broad set. The first is in error off the edge, but not to hand. The second is much better, leaning into a lavish cover drive that skips away to the rope in front of the grandstand. 

12.02pm BST
12:02

5th over: Pakistan 19-1 (Imam 9, Haris 4) Anderson in from the Pavilion End once more. I don’t expect that he will bowl many overs here with back to back Tests. Runs coming from three deliveries in this over, Haris clipping one, Imam driving three then Haris pushing another. He keeps the strike. But really, nothing to see here. Lunch is an hour away and the umpires have the power to extend the session by half an hour if they believe a result is imminent. In other words, one way or another, this ends before lunch.Watch that stump cartwheel 😍More clips: https://t.co/9jYAMDq8J7 #ENGvPAK pic.twitter.com/GSEPr4MTrZ

11.58am BST
11:58

4th over: Pakistan 14-1 (Imam 6, Haris 2) Broad charging in from the Nursery End and keeping Imam honest throughout, beating him with a good’un to finish. He receives generous applause from the modest crowd in today. Modest by Sunday at Lord’s standards that is, and for good reason. “‘Obsequies’ is a lovely word, isn’t it?” observes John Starbuck. Funeral rites, the definition (full disclosure: I googled). But yes, that’s what this is.

11.53am BST
11:53

3rd over: Pakistan 14-1 (Imam 6, Haris 2) Haris has three balls to look at, tucking neatly around the corner towards the rope beneath my spot in the press box. A couple for him. First time in 14 years that Pakistan pacers have taken 18 or more wickets in a Test. Last was against NZ in Wellington in 2003 when Shoaib Akhtar took 11 wickets. #EngvPak

Something there for Jimmy, picking up Azhar for the second time in the Test. That’s a beauty too, angling in before nipping past the outside edge, smashing into the off-stump. Can’t ask much more of him this week. Updated

11.48am BST
11:48

2nd over: Pakistan 11-0 (Azhar 4, Imam 5) “Does this not remind you of Adelaide?” asks Dan Norcross on TMS. Not wrong. A wicket second ball then all over in about an hour. Anyway, Imam’s turn and he’s going to make it count based on the early evidence, playing a glittering off-drive to get off the mark. That’s delightful. A single gets Azhar on strike and Broad beats him immediately.A couple of emails asking about the spot fixing documentary that has just gone live on Al Jazeera. With an abundance of caution, I’m leaving that alone for now, but Ali Martin is writing up a yarn. I’ll post here soon as it is live. 

11.42am BST
11:42

1st over: Pakistan 6-0 (Azhar 4, Imam 0) So, Imam is out there batting despite having copped a bad whack to the groin in the field just before Pakistan’s quicks finished it off. His senior partner Azhar Ali is taking the first ball from Anderson, though. He’s defending to begin before a couple of leg byes get the chase underway to fine leg. Then some runs off the bat to finish off the over, four of them, to third man. Not far from the catcher at third slip, but not to be. Updated

They are back on. Jimmy with the ball in his hand with 63 to defend. Yep. 

11.37am BST
11:37

Unsurprisingly, the England twitter account have not been posting videos of those wickets. But the clips, if you feel the need to watch them, are alongside the scorecard here (for those reading in the UK). “Do you think England after 141 years of test cricket are in with any chance of improving on Ireland’s five wicket loss to Pakistan in their first ever test?” asks Peter Salmon on the email. “Something to aim for.” In short: no. Aside from the final session yesterday, this has been horrid. As Vish Ehantharajah observed on yesteday, this may well be England’s ‘Hobart Moment’. When Australia were flogged by South Africa there a couple of years ago, five changes followed. Now, that won’t happen. But this side are in real strife at the start of a long summer. By contrast for Pakistan, Abbas finishes with match figures of 8-for-64. Just brilliant.

11.30am BST
11:30

There it is! For all the talk of tricky fourth innings chases, England lost four for seven this morning in 25 balls. It’s emphatic from Amir, uprooting Bess’ off stump. Pakistan need 64 to go one-nil up. Early bath then, lads. 

11.28am BST
11:28

82nd over: England 242-9 (Bess 57, Anderson 0) Jimmy nearly goes first ball! Big inside edge, very lucky it didn’t bend back his leg stump. Oh, I better hit send on this because... (you can probably tell what has happened first delivery of the next over). 

11.26am BST
11:26

A second ball blob for Broad, who bags himself a pair. Just a soft prod and Abbas finds the edge on the way through. Test wickets don’t come much easier than that. It came the ball after a lengthy delay when Imam was hit in the groin by a Broad drive that went to point, requiring the young man to leave the field in some distress. But given how small the fourth innings target is going to be, he can put his feet up. England lead by 63, adding only seven to their overnight score, losing three wickets along the way. Oh dear.

11.18am BST
11:18

It takes four deliveries with the second new ball for Amir to find Wood’s outside edge with a ball that nipped away beautifully. No footwork to speak of, but that’s excellent bowling to the tail. The left-armer warmed up rolling a couple down with the old ball, which enabled Bess to get off strike, but Wood didn’t have much of an idea there. Broad walks out on a pair. I did say this could happen quick. 81st over: England 241-8 (Bess 56) 

11.13am BST
11:13

80th over: England 240-7 (Bess 55, Wood 4) Shot. Wood off the mark with a lovely square drive to the rope. He’s happy to leave the rest alone. That’s the final over with the old ball and it is a successful one. It looks like they will take it straight away with Amir immediately on to replace Hasan. We’ll see.Here is the DRS map on the Buttler dismissal. Abbas has taken five LBWs in the match, Andrew Samson tells us on TMS. Nobody has taken six in a Test at Lord’s. He has a big chance to do so here with three England wickets on the shelf with the new nut.WICKET! Big blow for England as Abbas traps Buttler (67) in the second over of day four. Eng 236-7, lead Pakistan by 57, live on Sky Sports Cricket and Main Event. https://t.co/LPM9KGnhnU #ENGvPAK pic.twitter.com/Ff4U4rPDBN

No issue with that decision from Paul Reiffel, technology confirming that the ball is hitting middle and leg. Buttler was beaten on the inside edge from a delivery that just hinted back at the right-hander off the seam. More superb bowling from Abbas who is having a mighty Test Match. He’s in the book for a third time with his second ball of the morning. The 126-run stand is broken with England’s lead 57. Updated

BUTTLER GIVEN LBW! He’s reviewed. He has to. But it looks pretty good on the first look. Stand by.

11.04am BST
11:04

79th over: England 236-6 (Buttler 67, Bess 55)  Cripes, the third ball of the day has just about run along the ground. Can England hang around long enough for it to matter? Buttler digs out a yorker to cover but can’t beat the man there, but does keep the strike with a single squeezed to third man. 

11.00am BST
11:00

Azhar Mahmood ringing the bell. He scored a ton on debut at number eight in 1997, Dan Norcross advises on the wireless. That’s what Dom Bess is trying to do here. If you were wondering, the highest score for an England number eight on debut is Liam Dawson who made 66. He was the last man to debut in that position, as it happens. Bess resumes on 55. I made a mistake in the preamble earlier, by the way (which I’ll be editing in a tic). Keaton Jennings was, of course, the most recent hundred first up for England - not Trotty. Righto. Hasan Ali has the ball in his hand, Joss Buttler is on strike. PLAY! 

10.54am BST
10:54

Jos Buttler having a chat on radio. “He (Dom Bess) is a confident boy and he knows his game really well. He’s got a lot of talent with the bat. I’m not sure how many people knew it before this Test, but they do now.” Said from a tricky situation, they showed some “skill and character” to dig in during the final session. “I had the same mentality really, I played the situaiton. I said before the game whether the ball is red, white or pink, I play with the same (approach).”The players are due out in about five minutes and the sun is still poking through the clouds. But the updated forecast isn’t great, heavy rain expected around lunchtime.

Some more on The Hundred from Ali Martin the paper today. Looks like they are going to take it on the road (well, the UAE) to give it a spin later this year.Ultimately the plan is to have the scorecard showing the number of balls going down in each 100-ball innings – regardless of how that number is reached – as the score goes up. One senior ECB official told the Observer this is intended “to help answer the age-old question of ‘who is winning?’” and thus simplify cricket for the uninitiated.Groan.

10.28am BST
10:28

Andy Bull on Dom Bess. This line isn’t about the man on debut, but I’ll pull it out as it made me laugh:A lot of dubious thinking goes on at Lord’s on the Saturday of a Test match. Something about it seems to lead people to make the most bizarre decisions. How else does one explain all the preposterous clobber people wear? The blazers with candy-cane stripes, the schoolboy caps, the scarlet slacks, all those men ferreting around in their wardrobes asking: “Darling, have you seen my red trousers? I reckon it’s just the day for them.”

Adam CollinsWhen turning in last night, I thought this was going to be an OBO of the wet weather. How about that storm? Lightning strikes every few seconds for what felt like hours. 50,000 of them, I’m told. Followed by chunks of hail that were more tropical Queensland than London. But fast forward to the morning, and it’s all good at Lord’s.That might not be what England fans necessarily want to hear with the home side still so far behind in this Test, but the forecast says the rain will come again later today. So that gives us is a chance to revel in the work of a couple of lads from the west country who batted beautifully on Saturday afternoon to keep the contest vaguely alive.Without getting too far ahead of myself, Dom Bess has the chance to double his half-century and become the first Englishman since Keaton Jennings to record a hundred on Test debut (and the first ever from number eight). You get chapters in books written about you for that kind of thing. Go on, you good thing.As for the more senior man, Jos Buttler, he said his recall to the XI was like being on debut again, and resuming on 66, can salute for three figures for the first time in the creams for England as well. So, despite how it looks when these two joined 125 runs ago and hopes of a fourth day were fading, there remains more than a bit of interest here. Pakistan have been joyous in their celebrations across three days of this match so far but will be mindful their job is not done. If this incumbent pair can stick around for the bulk of this session, the fourth innings chase will enter nasty territory, much as it was when they batted last in Ireland a couple of weeks ago. No major concerns, but work to do. On the other hand, if they can keep the old ball reversing (or get the second new one going in two overs time) this could be over in a hurry and the visitors will triumph in London again, as they did both 2016 Tests here and the 2017 Champions Trophy Final. They like the capital as much as the city enjoys being in the European Union. Yes, I’ve been working on that gag all week and it still doesn’t work. Updated

The first Test finished just after noon on Sunday when the sun was at its zenith. There seemed to be shadows on the pitch all the same. Earlier in the morning al-Jazeera released a documentary on corruption in cricket. It included allegations that three English players had committed spot-fixing during the fifth Test against India in Chennai in December 2016 by agreeing to score a certain number of runs during a particular 10-over stretch of the game.The England response was robust. Their captain, Joe Root, called the allegations “ridiculous”, their coach Trevor Bayliss said they were “outrageous” and the ECB’s chief executive, Tom Harrison, said: “There is nothing we have seen that would make us doubt any of our players in any way whatsoever.”The film, Cricket’s Match-Fixers, included three strands. The most serious and substantial seems to be the allegations that members of the groundstaff at Galle in Sri Lanka were being paid by bookmakers to doctor pitches before Tests. The International Cricket Council has already launched an investigation into this. The second concerns a proposal for a new franchise tournament in Dubai, which would allegedly be set up with the sole purpose of enabling fixing, but the tournament never actually got off the ground. The third, least substantiated, are the allegations about spot-fixing during the Test in Chennai and another, between India and Australia, in Ranchi in 2017.There was an echo in all this of the Lord’s Test between England and Pakistan in 2010 when the News of the World broke the story that three Pakistani players – Mohammad Asif, Mohammad Amir and Salman Butt – were guilty of spot-fixing. England had dominated that match, just as Pakistan have dominated this one, and the final few overs of it played out on the Sunday morning after the News of the World ran its story.The key difference between then and now, other than who won and lost, is that the News of the World’s allegations were substantiated and ultimately led to criminal convictions. al-Jazeera’s allegations appear to be based on the word of a single, seemingly untrustworthy, source, and presented in a sensationalised documentary.But still, it added to the sense that this match was somehow upside down, that the positions of the two teams had been switched around. Pakistan have looked slick and efficient this week, their batsmen patient, their bowlers holding line and length. They have adapted brilliantly to typically English conditions. England are in a muddle, so uncomfortable that Bayliss said Lord’s felt like foreign ground. They have enough mess even without these allegations.“When we were told about it the thought was ‘rubbish’,” Bayliss said of the allegations. “But there’s nothing we can do about it if they want to put something out there. Let’s concentrate on getting out there and trying to play some good cricket.”Pakistan have been quite brilliant these last few days, but for that one session on Saturday evening when they seemed to slacken off, thinking, perhaps, the match was already as good as won since England were six down at tea and still 69 runs behind. By Sunday they regrouped and refocused. Their captain, Sarfraz Ahmed, pulled them into a tight little huddle after each and every one of the wickets they took, to push them on to the finish. The joy with which they celebrated each of those last tail-end wickets spoke plenty about how driven and committed they were feeling. In the end they won by nine wickets, at a canter.Pakistan were under just as much scrutiny as England before this series started, their fans were just as sceptical about the team’s chances. In the two years since they were last here the only teams they have beaten are West Indies, home and away, and Ireland in that one-off Test at Malahide. They had lost every other game they played which is why they have slipped to seventh in the world.The head coach, Mickey Arthur, had made some brave calls before the tour such as dropping Wahab Riaz because he was not working hard enough in training. “He hasn’t won us a game in two years,” was Arthur’s blunt assessment.There was a measure of despair, too, that the Pakistani selectors had overlooked Fawad Alam, who has scored more than 10,000 runs at 55 in first-class cricket. None of this went down well with the old Pakistani leg-spinner Abdul Qadir, who tore Arthur to pieces on live TV. “Who is Mickey Arthur? He is someone who was kicked out by South Africa and Australia. Mickey Arthur is the one who ruined Shane Watson’s cricket. Ruined the cricket of Ahmed Shehzad, Umar Akmal. Now he is after Wahab Riaz.” Qadir said the PCB had “handed over the reins to an incompetent white man who has not played Test cricket himself”.Arthur’s approach has backfired on him before, of course, when he was coaching Australia between 2011 and 2013. Arthur tried to force through sweeping changes to the culture of the team. He has been doing a similar thing in Pakistan, by pushing them to become more professional in their cricket, more committed to their fitness. He organised a four‑week training camp before this tour. You wondered then whether it was all going to blow up again. But judging by the way they have played these past four days, Arthur’s work is paying off.For once it is Pakistan who have their house in order. England, on the other hand …"

Ed Smith did not disappoint. Not for the first time the England and Wales Cricket Board promised “fresh ideas” and Smith duly delivered some that were genuinely fresh, coherently explained and rationally justified, unlike one or two other members/employees of the board in recent times.He was also remarkably relaxed in his new role. He can articulate with the best of them; indeed he sounded rather like his recent Australian counterpart, John Inverarity, who first bounced Smith on his knee at Tonbridge almost 40 years ago. He was enthusiastic and accommodating.“That’s a good question”, he said several times to his former colleagues; everything would be “terrific”. His was a polished debut in front of the press – he even managed to exit the room just as a question about The Hundred was being framed.Smith has broken with convention – though he kept stressing that “we” or “the selection panel” were responsible for the diverting list of 12 names chosen for the Lord’s Test – by selecting someone who has not encountered a red ball this year. This is a risk. But it is not a ridiculous one. He has long admired Jos Buttler and there is no doubting the wicketkeeper batsman’s talent or temperament; he knows and likes the grand occasion. But there is the problem that he has recently been programmed to hit every ball he receives for six or four, which he has been doing regularly for the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League.Buttler, while encouraged to play with freedom, will have to rediscover how to bat in a Test match – in a Test match at Lord’s. This is quite an undertaking but trusting in “a unique talent” and defying old truisms meets personal approval.Indeed Smith’s selections have brought a smile especially to the West Country. Even though the word “Lancashire” appears after the name of Buttler in the list, most of his fans in England reside west of Bristol, where he was born. Now having mourned the cruel injury to Jack Leach in the nets at Taunton on Monday, those fans can also celebrate the rapid elevation of Dom Bess out west.If this is not the case already, Bess might soon become the best off-spinner to come out of Blundell’s School in Tiverton and Somerset CCC for half a century or more. He has played only 16 first-class games, most of them on turning pitches at Taunton (or in Bridgetown, Barbados, where he took eight wickets for MCC in the match against Essex in March as well as hitting a century). Two or three years ago he was moving from Sidmouth CC in Devon to Exeter CC partly in search of more bowling opportunities. Now a Test match at Lord’s beckons – he is bound to play if the sun stays out.Bess was quick to commiserate with Leach, who has been a source of much sound advice for him over the last two years. In fact he is almost the polar opposite of Leach as a cricketer. Leach is a methodical man, who has improved by dint of much hard graft as a batsman and fielder as well as a bowler. Bess, who made his debut for Somerset in a two-day game against Pakistan in 2016, is more of an instinctive sportsman and a natural athlete. If the force is with him, things happen.He is a clean striker of the ball, who would bat above Stuart Broad in this team; he will certainly raise the standard of England in the outfield, where he buzzes and is capable of the odd breathtaking moment. So far he has never seemed overawed, though Lord’s will represent the highest hurdle yet.In Somerset’s recent game against Hampshire at Taunton Bess struck a breezy 92 and propelled 41 overs, taking the solitary wicket of Rilee Rossouw in the first innings for 77 runs. He bowled with sound control, admittedly against batsmen set upon saving the game in the second innings when most of his deliveries were at James Vince, who may have produced the most mature innings of his career and certainly his longest (514 minutes). Bess has already shown he is not intimidated by bowling on a turning pitch (some spinners are); there is less evidence about how he fares on a flat one. However he is always up for the challenge and his debut will be an exciting moment, not just for those in Devon and Somerset.Indeed the announcement of this squad prompts a smile and a spring in the step; it represents the most cheerful thing to come out of the ECB this summer. A month ago Smith was unlikely to be the man to provide fans with eager anticipation. This season your correspondent has occasionally railed against The Hundred and the plans for domestic cricket to no great effect. Now on consecutive days Colin Graves, albeit unwittingly, seems to have been more effective in providing reasons to reconsider the ECB’s guardianship of the game. Meanwhile Smith, trusting his gut rather than the data (though he is “interested in data”), has, by making two bold selections, invigorated the summer of 2018. The first Test should be fun for young and old alike."

Celia Brackenridge, who has died aged 67 from leukaemia, was an international sportswoman, a campaigner for women’s causes and an authority on child protection in sport. She carried out pioneering work on the sexual abuse and harassment of young athletes and footballers by their coaches in the 1980s and 90s. Her research led her further to examine the sexual, physical and emotional abuse of all athletes, her findings being met with total denial by the then sports establishment.In 2001 she began working with the Football Association to assess the state of child protection at clubs, and to monitor a new FA strategy to protect junior players, but what was intended to be a £1m, five-year project was curtailed because of internal disputes in the Football Association and a disagreement between Adam Crozier (then FA chief executive) and the Premier League clubs, which objected to the project. Her work will live on because it is being incorporated into the current inquiry into abuse in football, led by Clive Sheldon QC.By nature a rebel, Celia would challenge authority, whether at local, national or Olympic level, to take action to protect young people in sport – often facing hostility from those who would not believe that such a problem existed. As she said in the 90s: “People thought I was a troublemaker and trampling on paradise. It was the same in the church – people could not bear to believe this could happen because these were places of sanctuary.”Her reputation grew in Britain and internationally as she worked in collaboration with the NSPCC, Unicef, the International Olympic Committee and the Paralympic movement. Her final job was as a child protection adviser to Dame Janet Smith’s inquiry into the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jimmy Savile at the BBC.She was born in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, the middle child of John Brackenridge, a dentist, and his wife, Joan (nee Stroud), who was then a Women’s Royal Air Force sergeant and jazz singer. She won an assisted place at Lady Eleanor Holles school for girls in Hampton, south-west London, where she excelled in sport and music. Against the wishes of her headteacher, she decided not to go to university and instead trained as a physical education teacher at Bedford College of Education.She shone at Bedford and was selected to be one of the few certificate of education students to go to Cambridge University, where, as well as a BEd with first-class honours (1972), she earned a double sporting blue, for lacrosse at national level and for women’s cricket at county level.She was selected to play lacrosse for England and then Great Britain. She became captain, winning the Vaux Silver award for leading the team to five victories over Australia in 1979. She was in the side for 14 years, making the Guinness Book of Records in the mid-80s for the most appearances as a GB lacrosse player.She then had a brief period as national team coach for the Lacrosse World Cup in the US, where she was not as successful, having already changed career direction for academia by becoming a full-time lecturer at a teacher training college, now part of Sheffield Hallam University.She was a founder and first chair of the Women’s Sports Foundation UK, a lobby group intended to raise public awareness of gender inequality in sport and influence public policy. She described it as “like a Greenpeace for women’s sport”.This transformed itself into the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation. In 1994, in Brighton, it held its first world conference attended by 82 countries and adopted what became known as the Brighton Declaration on Women and Sport, promoting the involvement of women at all levels in sport, including coaching and administration. This has now been taken up by more than 150 national organisations.At the same time Celia pioneered research into the sexual and physical abuse of young athletes by their coaches.

cricket,"• Buttler and Bess lead England fightback at Lord’s • ‘It was like Joe Root walked back out, with his cover drives’
Ali Martin at Lord's

Jos Buttler thought Joe Root had walked back out to join him in the middle, such was the skill and temperament on display from Dom Bess as these two sons of the Somerset academy set about rescuing England from the ignominy of a three-day defeat.It remains to be seen whether their twin half-centuries in an unbroken seventh-wicket stand of 125 runs compiled over the course of the final session on Saturday have simply delayed the inevitable in this series opener against an impressive Pakistan team.Buttler, who reached the close on 66 not out in his first Test in 18 months, was still hoping that England can extend their lead of 56 to a target of around 200 for the tourists. But whatever happens, he believes a gem has been found in young Bess.Of the 20-year-old’s 55 not out, which made him the third youngest England debutant to register a half-century after Denis Compton and Haseeb Hameed, Buttler said: “It was like Joe Root walked back out, with his back foot punches and cover drives. He’s got a great character and he really showed that.“I had just left Somerset [in 2014] when he came up from the academy, so I hadn’t seen much of him. But I had heard a bit from the guys I keep in touch with. You wouldn’t think it’s his first game for England. He loves the competitive side of things, whether with bat or ball, and he has some really good attributes, which you need in international cricket.”Root’s departure on the stroke of tea had left England staring into the abyss at 110 for six, still 68 runs behind. But as Bess went inside out to lace Mohammad Amir through extra cover off the final ball of the day, minutes after raising his bat to all corners of Lord’s, the beleaguered hosts at least had something to smile about.“We were both trying to scrap hard for the team,” said Buttler. “The atmosphere was great at the end and in the dressing room as well. Joe had said it was a hard pitch to start on, so partnerships were going to be crucial . We managed to put together a good one and now we need to make it as big as we can.”Buttler’s own 130-ball vigil was 10 balls more than an entire innings in his recent format of choice, having been parachuted into the side this summer as a specialist batsman at No 7 off the back of an impressive showing in the recent Indian Premier League.Though he took Hasan Ali for three fours in a single over, this was a far cry from his record run of five half-centuries for Rajasthan Royals. Despite a rash drive in the first innings here, the 27-year-old has switched over to the demands of Test cricket impressively.Buttler said: “It felt great. I was trying to use all my experience from every tournament, every championship game, whatever. The game is based around making good decisions ball after ball. I had spoken before the Test about trying not to worry about the colour of the ball and trying to keep a very good mind-set, which I have had for a few weeks.”“I was feeling in good form and playing in front of big crowds out in India. Playing here it is a very similar feel, it’s a big occasion. It’s trying to pull from past experiences and show people I can play.”Pakistan’s Asad Shafiq, who spoke for the tourists after the close, said: “I don’t think we did anything wrong in that final session. We should give credit to the English batsmen and especially the debutant. We will try to get them as soon as we can. We will not be happy to chase anything over 150.”"

The day before the start of play they were still putting the finishing touches to Test cricket’s newest venue, the modest, pretty little ground at Malahide. So over the top of the pick-pack-pock-puck of the practising batsmen there was the sound of workmen hammering and drilling, fixing loudspeakers on the scaffold grandstands and new hoardings around the impermanent pavilion. Down the road a man was putting a fresh coat of paint on the railings by the station. The Irish have been waiting, working, a long time for this first Test match and want everything to go just so.“It’s been quite a while building up to this since it was announced,” said Ireland’s captain, William Porterfield. “I am sure there will be a lot of different emotions that will flow through everyone in the next 24 hours.” Mainly excitement, he said, but some anxiety, too. The pitch is green, the forecast awful and Pakistan have a formidable attack. Ireland aren’t short of first-class experience – they’ve more of that than this callow Pakistan side – but Boyd Rankin is the only man among them who has ever played a Test.So even Porterfield, 33, and Ed Joyce, 39, aren’t quite sure how they will handle it all. The team had a long chat with Marcus Trescothick after their warm-up match against Somerset to get a better idea about what to expect. “He talked about the experience of playing Test cricket and how the standard is just that little higher than county cricket, how it’s more relentless,” Porterfield said. It was nothing they had not heard before from their coach, Graham Ford, but Porterfield still found it reassuring.The captain and his team are acutely aware that they are not just representing themselves, but all the Irish cricketers before them, the men who never had the chance to play a Test. “It would be remiss if we didn’t talk about everything that has gone before us. Not only over the last five or 10 years, which everyone remembers, but about every cricketer who has ever played for Ireland. On and off the pitch, administrators and a lot of people have devoted a lot of their lives to make this happen.”Cricket has a long history in Ireland. There were playing in Phoenix Park back in 1730, and by 1860 it had become one of the most popular sports in the country. There were around 300 clubs in Ireland at that point and the national team waswere strong enough to beat MCC by an innings at Lord’s in 1858. Everything started to change when the Gaelic Athletic Association was formed in 1884, and then, at the turn of the 20th century, banned GAA members from playing or attending foreign sports.Back then, there wasn’t an Irish Cricket Union to protect or promote the sport. As a result the game, so strongly associated with England, dwindled in popularity. It became a minority sport, played in patches of Northern Ireland and middle-class areas of Dublin and Cork. The national team played annual matches against Scotland and tour games against counties and countries. They won some famous victories, against South Africa in 1904, West Indies in 1928 and 1969. But they were seen as beer matches.Even in the 1990s, when Cricket Ireland finally appointed their first full-time coach, Mike Hendrick, the game was an amateur affair, and often as not the players would have to covering their own costs. When Adrian Birrell took over as coach in 2002, he was told the boot of his company car was supposed to double up as a storeroom for the team’s kit. When Warren Deutrom became the chief executive in 2006, he was the board’s only full-time member of staff, with a part-time PA who worked four mornings a week.It is fitting that Pakistan are their opponents in this first Test, since they were the team Ireland beat in their breakthrough game, on St Patrick’s Day at the 2007 World Cup, a three-wicket victory that put them on the front pages and to the forefront of associate cricket. After that, Deutrom pushed through the modernisation of the sport. The first professional contracts followed in 2009, an interprovincial domestic competition was launched in 2013 and now, 11 years after that win in Jamaica, they are at last being allowed to play Test cricket.Porterfield played in that famous match in 2007. “It’s obviously been a long journey,” he said, “but in some ways a pretty quick journey as well.”When Porterfield started, Ireland did not even have ODI status, “now tomorrow we’re going out there and playing the first Test match for Ireland”. Along the way there has been, he said, “a long banging of the drum”. And now it’s done, there’s excitement, anxiety, and more than either of those, the gratitude. “It just culminates with us being lucky enough at the time of our careers to be able to take the pitch to play that first Test match.”"

Cameron Bancroft will be free to play grade cricket for Western Australia club Willetton before the end of his nine-month ban for ball-tampering. Bancroft incurred the suspension from Cricket Australia for his part in the ball-tampering controversy which engulfed Steve Smith’s side during the Cape Town Test against South Africa two months ago. Captain Smith and his deputy David Warner were both banned from international and domestic cricket for a year after a plan was hatched to alter the condition of the ball at Newlands. They are clear to play for their club sides in New South Wales, but a quirk of state association rules in Western Australia meant Bancroft needed an exemption to do so at the start of next season. The opener, at 25 just eight matches into his Test career, admitted to applying sandpaper to the ball after television cameras showed him stashing the evidence down his trousers. As a result, Somerset announced he would not be playing for them this summer, after they had initially signed him to do so while he was helping Australia to beat England 4-0 and so regain the Ashes in his maiden Test series last winter. After an extraordinary general meeting on Monday night, however, it was announced the Western Australian District Cricket Council has provided Bancroft with an outlet to return once the 2018-19 domestic grade season starts. The decision was confirmed in a tweet from the Western Australia Cricket Association.It read: “The WADCC has granted Cameron Bancroft an exemption to play Premier Cricket for Willetton during the 2018-19 season.” Bancroft reportedly did not attend the meeting, at which WA’s Premier Cricket clubs voted by a majority of 14 to two to allow his return. WACA chief executive Christina Matthews told Cricket Australia’s website: “I’m pleased to announce the Western Australia District Cricket Council tonight approved Willetton’s application for an exemption to the rule that prevented Cameron from playing Premier Cricket this season. “It was strongly debated across a number of areas, but ultimately approved. It’s great news for Cameron, and I’d like to congratulate the WADCC on their decision.”Bancroft will therefore be able to play for his club side up to three months before his CA ban ends in late December."

Joe Root urged England supporters to “keep the faith” with his ailing Test side after conceding that Pakistan outplayed them in all facets of the game during the crushing nine-wicket defeat at Lord’s.It was the first time in 23 years that England have lost the opening Test of a home summer – this previously occurred against West Indies in 1995 – and follows a horror winter during which England surrendered the Ashes 4-0 in Australia and endured a 1-0 series defeat in New Zealand.Root, along with the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, and national selector Ed Smith, must decide whether to stick with the same squad for the second and final Test at Headingley starting on Friday, with the out-of-form opener Mark Stoneman looking most vulnerable after two failures.Asked what his message to supporters would be, the England Test captain replied: “Keep the faith, keep trusting, keep believing. We know we’re underperforming. It’s very difficult to take as a talented group of players but we fully believe we can get to where we want. We got it wrong, we know that. These conditions suit us as well which is why it’s so disappointing.”England were chasing the game from day one when, having won the toss, they were all out for 184. Root put that call down to a dry pitch and had no regrets per se. But Pakistan’s seam attack still exploited what live grass there was, with Mohammad Abbas named man of the match following his eight wickets across the two innings.Root, whose side put down five catches as the tourists took control in their first‑innings reply of 363 said: “We’ve been outplayed across all three departments – and in particular, it was disappointing with the bat first up. It really hurt us not getting the score we needed. It’s easy to look at this and say: ‘Right, we need to make drastic changes.’ But it’s not just one or two guys – we were collectively all under par this week. We have to take that on the chin, learn the lessons very quickly and make sure we respond. It would be easy to go into next week feeling sorry for ourselves and think there’s no way forward – but there is.”Of huge concern to Root and Bayliss will be that three days of intense training leading into the Test was followed by such a limp performance. Pakistan, by contrast, adapted perfectly to conditions despite a top six that boasts fewer caps collectively than Alastair Cook’s 155 and an attack similarly less experienced than Jimmy Anderson alone.Sarfraz Ahmed, the Pakistan captain, said: “To take wickets in England you have to pitch the ball up. So credit goes to my bowlers, they bowled really well and to the plans, pitching up the ball. Especially the first day – the way Abbas and Hasan Ali bowled.“No praise is enough for the boys especially the fast bowlers who set the tone on the first day, then our batsmen responded. I don’t think any young team would have done something like this previously at this prestigious ground.”"

It’s been a busy day for Vic Marks. He presented Dom Bess with his England cap this morning, and this evening he wrote a match report for your perusal.With that, it’s time to head into the night. Thanks for your company; we’ll be back tomorrow morning. Goodnight.

Hasan Ali speaks! “We had a long meeting and our plan was to bowl fuller because the pitch was fresh with a bit of moisture. That’s where we succeeded. Playing in the Champions Trophy last year helped me adjust to English conditions. I would love to use the Duke ball all the time!”

6.47pm BST
18:47

Alastair Cook speaks! “Pakistan have had the better day, but with a five-day match you’ve got the chance to come back. Fifty for one can quickly become 80 for four, but credit to Pakistan. I thought it was a really interesting toss decision – the pitch is dry but it did have live grass on. The forecast is that it’ll get warmer. We were probably 60/70 short on that wicket, and it’s probably going to be a first innings v fourth innings game – 250 on the last day could be really hard work.”

A summary of the day’s play Updated
at 6.41pm BST


6.34pm BST
18:34

23rd over: Pakistan 50-1 (Azhar Ali 18, Haris Sohail 21) Ben Stokes switches ends to bowl the last over the day, a maiden to the excellent Azhar Ali. That’s stumps. The day’s play was dominated entirely by England until the first ball was bowled – after winning the toss and choosing to bat, they were hustled out for 184 by Pakistan’s superb seam attack. Azhar Ali and Haris Sohail then showed the value of defensive batting to take Pakistan to 50 for one, a deficit of 134. They have a great chance to take control of the game tomorrow, though England will know that no game against Pakistan is lost after one day. Except ODIs, obviously.

6.28pm BST
18:28

22nd over: Pakistan 50-1 (Azhar Ali 18, Haris Sohail 21) With five minutes remaining, Dom Bess comes on for his first bowl in Test cricket. He’s demonstratively setting his own field, a sign of his unusual maturity. All the available evidence suggest temperament will not be a problem, and he starts with a good over that includes a couple of skiddy deliveries which almost sneak past Haris’s defence. The last ball is a bit loose and cut for four. 

6.24pm BST
18:24

21st over: Pakistan 46-1 (Azhar Ali 18, Haris Sohail 17) Azhar wrings his hand after taking a short ball from Wood on the glove. Wood is starting to make things happen, but he can’t rip Azhar from his bubble. He glides two more to third man and has 18 from 66 balls, the perfect innings in this situation.

6.20pm BST
18:20

20th over: Pakistan 43-1 (Azhar Ali 16, Haris Sohail 16) Stokes tries to make up for his error with a lively over to Azhar, who calms everything down with some solid defensive strokes. A maiden. Stokes has looked good in this short spell though. 

6.18pm BST
18:18

19th over: Pakistan 43-1 (Azhar Ali 16, Haris Sohail 16) The two teams have played like each other today. Pakistan have batted patiently and bowled full; England batted friskily and are experimenting with the ball. And now England have dropped the kind of catch that Pakistan are supposed to put down! Haris Sohail was turned round by a terrific delivery from Wood and edged it towards Malan at second slip. He was waiting to take a relatively simple catch when Stokes flew across him from third slip and put down a one-handed chance. Oh, England (reprise).Updated
at 6.18pm BST


6.11pm BST
18:11

18th over: Pakistan 41-1 (Azhar Ali 15, Haris Sohail 15) There’s a hush around Lord’s, though I suspect it’s born of booze rather than anticipation. Azhar Ali scrunches Stokes to third man for four. His approach – please don’t call it game management – has been immaculate.

6.08pm BST
18:08

17th over: Pakistan 36-1 (Azhar Ali 11, Haris Sohail 14) There’s just under half an hour’s play remaining. Wood jumps wide on the crease to beat Azhar Ali, a smart piece of bowling. Though England haven’t bowled brilliantly, they could easily have picked up two or three wickets tonight.Updated
at 6.11pm BST


6.06pm BST
18:06

16th over: Pakistan 34-1 (Azhar Ali 10, Haris Sohail 13) Ben Stokes replaces Stuart Broad, who bowled a good spell of 7-4-10-1, and promptly beats Sohail with a full-length outswinger. Beautifully bowled. Updated
at 6.08pm BST


5.58pm BST
17:58

15th over: Pakistan 36-1 (Azhar Ali 14, Haris Sohail 11) The Pakistan batsmen look comfortable against Wood, despite his extra pace. He hasn’t made them play enough, and Azhar in particular is happy to ignore as many deliveries as possible before the close.Updated
at 6.03pm BST


5.54pm BST
17:54

14th over: Pakistan 32-1 (Azhar Ali 10, Haris Sohail 11) A very full delivery from Broad beats Haris’s attempted drive. The follow-up delivery is too straight and zips away for four leg-byes. England really need at least one more wicket before the close or tomorrow could be a serotonin-sapper.

5.50pm BST
17:50

13th over: Pakistan 26-1 (Azhar Ali 10, Haris Sohail 9) Azhar is beaten, feeling for a sharp short ball from Wood. I was just about to say that Pakistan have played smarter cricket than England today; that was one of only a few loose strokes in the innings, and they bowled fuller as well. Updated
at 5.50pm BST


5.45pm BST
17:45

12th over: Pakistan 26-1 (Azhar Ali 10, Haris Sohail 9) There are 18 overs remaining, though we won’t get them all as play will end in 50 minutes’ time (I think). Haris has shown such good judgement outside off stump that Broad has moved around the wicket. The second ball from the new angle beats Haris’s nervous fence outside off stump. Another good over from Broad, his fourth maiden of the innings.

5.40pm BST
17:40

11th over: Pakistan 26-1 (Azhar Ali 10, Haris Sohail 9) Mark Wood replaces Jimmy Anderson, who bowled an okay first spell of 5-2-11-0. His pace is good, with his second ball measured at 89.2mph. The speedgun has come a long way from the England v Pakistan Test at Lord’s in 1996, when Mark Ealham was clocked as being faster than Wasim Akram. Azhar flicks confidently through midwicket for a couple to end Wood’s quiet first over.

5.35pm BST
17:35

10th over: Pakistan 22-1 (Azhar Ali 7, Haris Sohail 8) Haris survives a relatively quiet LBW appeal for Broad, with replays showing an inside-edge. Another good over from Broad, who tries to set Sohail up for the drive. Sohail declines the offer.

5.29pm BST
17:29

9th over: Pakistan 22-1 (Azhar Ali 7, Haris Sohail 8) I’d be tempted to have a look at Ben Stokes, who might make the ball hoop in these conditions. Anderson is driven crisply through mid-off for three by Sohail.“Dear Rob,” says Dave Seare. “The Smith regime has been tottering since he failed to name Ed Sheeran, Simon Cowell and that bloke off the PPI ads among his scouts. And his emphasis on cricket flies in the face of ECB policy.”Updated
at 5.31pm BST


5.25pm BST
17:25

8th over: Pakistan 17-1 (Azhar Ali 6, Haris Sohail 4) Broad has another LBW celebration turned down by Rod Tucker, this time against Azhar Ali. There was a huge inside edge and it probably hit the pad outside off stump. That aside, it was plumb. Another, more polite LBW appeal is turned down two balls later – Azhar was well outside the line but I think Broad argued he was hiding his bat. This is a challenging spell from Broad, whose knees are pumping so much that he’s in danger of knocking his own front teeth out.

5.20pm BST
17:20

7th over: Pakistan 16-1 (Azhar Ali 6, Haris Sohail 4) Azhar, pushing around his front pad at a sharp off-cutter, survives a big LBW appeal from Anderson. England decide not to review; replays show it did far too much and would have missed leg. Sohail is then beaten by a length delivery that moves sharply off the seam. England haven’t pitched it up as much as Pakistan.“If England are playing Wood because they want to get pace into the XI (though Lord’s in May not be the ideal time and place), they should have picked Olly Stone, who is the quickest bowler in English cricket and in form,” says Gary Naylor. “He’s also 24 and has played nearly twice as many first-class matches as Dom Bess.”I’m sure he was discussed but two debutants might have been too great a risk. But it’s probably about time we asked a difficult question: has Ed Smith taken this team as far as he can?

5.16pm BST
17:16

6th over: Pakistan 16-1 (Azhar Ali 6, Haris Sohail 4) It was a good delivery from Broad, fullish and snaking back towards the pad. I suspect the umpire Rod Tucker, as with the Ben Stokes dismissal earlier in the session, thought it had pitched outside leg stump. The new batsman is the left-handed Haris Sohail, who is playing his fourth Test. He is beaten first ball by a very good delivery and then gets off the mark with a swaggering clip over midwicket for four. “I have a theory that I believe explains the current failure of our batsmen,” says Kim Thonger. “They’ve been traumatised by the number of GDPR emails they’ve received in the last 24 hours. It’s destroyed their ability to concentrate. The good news is my theory predicts a gradual recovery as they all get used to GDPR not actually affecting their lives at all when the fuss dies down. Unless it does, then the whole summer is a write off.“Updated

at 5.12pm BST


5.08pm BST
17:08

5th over: Pakistan 11-0 (Azhar Ali 6, Imam-ul-Haq 4) It’s been a pretty solid start from Pakistan, that one thick edge notwithstanding, and Imam comfortably sees off Anderson’s third over.“Re: your comment about Buttler’s dismissal,” begins Matt Dony. “Unless you live in some multiple-kitchen lap of luxury, then ‘every sink in the house’ probably amounts to ‘the kitchen sink.’ Bathrooms and WC’s have basins. I realise this is pedantry on a depressing level, but here we are. As is so often the case, that is all I have to offer.”You haven’t seen my new office. I use sinks instead of desks as it cuts out those wasted rehydration minutes.

5.05pm BST
17:05

4th over: Pakistan 10-0 (Azhar Ali 5, Imam-ul-Haq 4) A better over from Broad, who jags one back to hit Imam in the breadbasket. The fuller follow-up is thick-edged wide of the slips for four. That was a fairly loose stroke, with not much foot movement.

5.00pm BST
17:00

3rd over: Pakistan 5-0 (Azhar Ali 5, Imam-ul-Haq 0) That’s a lovely shot from Azhar Ali, who leans into an Anderson outswinger and drives it through mid-off for four. He is a key man at the best of times but especially if this becomes a low-scoring game, because he has the capacity to bat all day. Sometimes he even plays a defensive stroke!Imam then survives an appeal for a catch down the leg side off Anderson. It was a stunning low take from Bairstow but the ball hit only the pad.“Good afternoon Rob,” says Dave Brown. “I rather think England have missed a trick by preferring Wood to Woakes. They’ve always had this fascination with pace which I’ve never really got. Fair enough if you’ve got Marshall, Donald, Holding et al but I feel Wood could be quite expensive here.”Wasn’t it just part of the restructuring of the team? I thought that was a really difficult decision – Woakes definitely gives you a better chance of winning this match, but England want to break the cycle of home wins and away defeats. I’d like to see much more flexibility and rotation, with different XIs for almost every game, but it will take decades for that to happen. What I’m saying is: I’m a visionary!

4.56pm BST
16:56

2nd over: Pakistan 0-0 (Azhar Ali 0, Imam-ul-Haq 0) Imam-ul-Haq is beaten first ball, chasing a very wide delivery from Broad. A quiet over thereafter, with Broad’s radar not quite right. “Maybe the lads are pushing towards a 100-ball Test format for people not interested in cricket,” says Dave Seare. “There’s an endearing lack of competence about England batting these days, though well bowled Pakistan.”I thought it was more about Pakistan’s bowling than England’s batting. That said, there has never been an England line-up less capable of defensive batting than this one. 

4.51pm BST
16:51

1st over: Pakistan 0-0 (Azhar Ali 0, Imam-ul-Haq 0) Anderson’s first over is a promising maiden, with plenty of outswing and one play-and-miss from Azhar Ali. England will want a minimum of two wickets tonight; if they start well they could get four or five.

Say what you like about England - and I wouldn’t want to be a foam-allergic keyboard right now - but that was a blistering bowling performance from Pakistan. They even backed it up in the field. See you in 10 minutes to see how England’s bowlers fare. Meantime, here’s a precis of the day so far (NB: clip contains adult language)

4.38pm BST
16:38

That’ll do. Wood mis-pulls towards mid-on, where Amir swoops to take a terrific catch. A year on from the horror of Cardiff, England have been savaged by Pakistan’s pace bowlers again.

4.35pm BST
16:35

58th over: England 180-9 (Wood 3, Anderson 0) “I’ve been struggling to express the core reason why Pakistan are the life, soul and party of this fabulous game we call cricket,” writes Peter Cork. “I think the answer is: ask anyone to point-blank name the first 20 cricketers who put a smile on their face. Do this for 50 people, from all nationalities and all walks of life. Chances are, that top 20 will be 40% Pakistani, 60% other.” 

4.33pm BST
16:33

Most of the wickets have come from full-length deliveries. Pakistan’s complementary seam attack have been terrific - and there goes another! Broad is trapped LBW by a fine off-cutter to the left-hander, and is so obviously plumb that he doesn’t even consider a review. Updated

On a sunlit Saturday evening Jos Buttler and Dom Bess, both oblivious to the torments endured in the dressing room of England’s Test team over the winter, saved their side from total ignominy. At 110 for six at tea, a basketful of humiliations were on the horizon: a three-day finish, an innings defeat, a terrible loss of face, not to mention income, which is deemed quite important in these parts.Then Buttler and Bess, both revelling in the chance to show their worth rather than fearing the consequence of another failure, calmly restored order by batting throughout the final session in an unbeaten stand of 125. Bess posted his maiden Test half-century and the debutant had the nerve, when acknowledging the crowd’s applause, to give the impression that this was a routine event for him - without quite succeeding.This was a heartwarming moment even for those not born west of Taunton. At the very least this pair have delayed the inquests into a horrid performance by England at Lord’s. Currently they lead by 56 with four wickets in hand, far from ideal but it could have been so much worse.Until Saturday’s final session the only thing that England had won in this match was the toss – and that did not do them much good. Pakistan have batted, bowled and caught better against all the odds. It is May; it is England in their own backyard (if we can refer to Lord’s so irreverently). So all had seemed set fair for Joe Root’s side after the travails of the winter. For two days conditions were archetypally English with a greenish pitch below and cloud cover above, perfect for playing against a callow Pakistan side, currently ranked seventh in the world, or so we thought.To claw their way back into this game England had to mount a significant second innings score on the third day and there was reason to believe that this was possible. The sun was out; the pitch had changed colour with the green tinge fast disappearing.But then England started batting and by tea they were in disarray. As in the first innings, Pakistan’s bowlers were wonderfully disciplined; they bowled full and straight and with their supple wrists behind the seam they found flickers of movement; they were supported by alert, rather than athletic, fielders eager to snaffle any chance that came their way and comforted by the fact that only Root among the top order threatened any kind of permanence. The rest were out of form or out of luck and appeared almost resigned to the fact that the task ahead was too monumental - the first-innings deficit was 179.The Pakistan bowlers propelled some serious deliveries to undermine the top order but even during the periods in between the fall of wickets, there was the impression that England were going nowhere. This sense of fragility was triggered in the second over of the innings when Alastair Cook was lbw to Mohammad Abbas. It was a devilish delivery to any newly-arrived batsman since it jagged down the slope before thudding into the knee roll of Cook’s pad, one of those lbws where the experienced batsman does not even bother to glance at his partner to check the merit of a review. Instead Cook turned immediately and headed towards an uncomfortably silent Long Room.Mark Stoneman was clearly out of touch but determined to hang on in there, if only to earn the sobriquet “Stonewall”, and he survived long enough to prompt Sarfraz Ahmed to introduce his spinner. Stoneman edged a boundary against Shadab Khan and was then scuttled by a nasty delivery that turned out of the rough and kept low before hitting the off-stump. This was a “respectable” dismissal but in this match there has been no evidence to suggest that Stoneman has a place in England’s strongest XI for the Headingley Test, which starts next Friday.Dawid Malan was barely more fluent alongside Root. The crowd was uneasy, willing England to progress, cheering the odd delicate boundary from Root, not out of any patriotic fervour; they just craved a contest. A deft late cut against Mohammad Amir took Root to his 50, out of a total of 76 for two, which demonstrated the gulf between him and the rest.Then the game swung violently after the drinks interval in the afternoon session. Another tentative prod against Amir from Malan produced an edge and a fine sprawling catch by Sarfraz, diving to his left. Two balls later Jonny Bairstow was bowled by a perfect in-swinger from Amir; it’s hard to replicate those in practice however assiduously you go about your business.Ben Stokes announced himself with two crisp boundaries before departing to a soft dismissal. He punched a shortish ball from Shadab firmly to mid-wicket, where the substitute fielder, Fakhar Zaman, held a fine catch. When Root was lbw to the constantly impressive Abbas for 67, England had slumped to 110 for six and all was glum at Lord’s. Then the mood was magically lifted by Buttler and Bess.There was nothing unorthodox from Buttler. He was positive but never extravagant in his strokeplay and, unlike several others, he is manifestly seeing the ball well, just as he was for the Rajasthan Royals 10 days ago. Unsurprisingly, Bess was tentative at the start but not overawed. Then he hit two flighty boundaries against Faheem Ashraf and he settled in, stroking six more fours with ever-increasing assurance. Meanwhile, Buttler was happy with an unaccustomed, avuncular role at the other end. Probably for the first time in the match, the new national selector Ed Smith wore a smile."

Graham HardcastleTwo England seamers past and present combined for Lancashire as they claimed a notable first win of the season by toppling the Division One leaders Nottinghamshire by an innings and 67 runs early on day three at Trent Bridge. Graham Onions, who played the last of his nine Tests in 2012, claimed six wickets in the second innings and nine in the match, while the incumbent Jimmy Anderson ably backed him up with four wickets in the second and six overall.This was Lancashire’s first win in five this season, and they gained revenge for an opening‑round defeat against Nottinghamshire at Old Trafford last month. The hosts started day three on 106 for five having conceded a first-innings lead of 205. They were bowled out for just 138. Onions, a 35-year-old new signing for the Red Rose, is now nine wickets away from 650 career first-class scalps. .There was another victory of note at New Road, where the champions Essex came from behind to beat Worcestershire, who fell 33 short of a 215 target. Essex bounced back from losing their first Championship match in 19 against Yorkshire at Chelmsford last weekend, with the off-spinner Simon Harmer and the Australian overseas seamer Peter Siddle equally sharing the second‑innings wickets. The bottom side Worcestershire had been 50 for one and 160 for five in their pursuit.Yorkshire’s captain Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow are under pressure against Surrey at the Oval, with the visitors made to follow-on 185 runs behind midway through the afternoon. Unfortunately for Root, he fell twice in the day for 14 and 23, trapped lbw by on-song Sam Curran and bowled through the gate by the fledgling off-spinner Amar Virdi. Bairstow, however, enjoyed a more productive day. He counter-attacked for 95 off 94 balls, passing 6,000 career Championship runs on the way, and finished the day unbeaten on 25 second time around. Yorkshire closed on 142 for five, 43 behind. Curran, 19, finished with six for 54 in the first innings and was awarded his first-team cap at lunch. Warwickshire strengthened their grip on top spot in Division Two with a six-wicket win against Northamptonshire at Edgbaston, their third from four matches. Chasing a 180 target, they were 94 for four, but the opener Will Rhodes posted 100 not out. Kent replaced Sussex in second place by comfortably defending a 270 target at Canterbury. The New Zealand seamer Matt Henry finished with six wickets and 10 in the match to take his tally to 37 in four Championship outings this summer.At Grace Road, Leicestershire claimed a nail-biting three-run win over Glamorgan, who recovered from 139 for eight chasing 251. Marchant de Lange smashed 90 off 45 balls to heighten nerves, but the Foxes held on for only a third Championship win since 2012. Middlesex are chasing an innings victory over Gloucestershire, who started their second 245 behind at Lord’s and closed on 66 for two. Derbyshire and Durham are heading for a high-scoring draw at Derby.Updated

Vic MarksOut came the sun and out went the demons from the Taunton pitch. At last the batsmen could look down at the strip of fast-fading green turf and they felt that they could trust it. There was minimal lateral movement and just a hint of swing under a cloudless sky, and the ball would not turn for the spinners in a match that has been dominated so far by Somerset.The hosts, who contrived 506 after being 134 for five, raced away in the morning with James Hildreth purring along with the tail. In fact it might be regarded as a fake tail. After the early departure of Jack Leach, leaving a ball from Fidel Edwards and losing his off-stump, Dom Bess demonstrated that he is an imposter at No 10.In 30 overs the irrepressible Bess added 145 with Hildreth. He dominated the strike and the scoring as the Hampshire attack, deprived of Kyle Abbott again, began to wilt. Bess scores in similar areas to Hildreth, square of the wicket, and he is just as rapid stealing singles. He adds buzz to whatever he is doing on a cricket field, which will not include batting at No 10 for much longer.Only Hildreth’s final shot was ugly. Before lunch on 184 he mishit a high full toss from Tom Alsop to mid‑on. After the break Tim ­Groenewald swung merrily but Bess, on 92, was denied his first century for Somerset by a fine delivery from Gareth Berg.Batting was a more serious business when Hampshire began their second innings with a deficit of 275. The tempo declined but the skill level did not. Somerset’s attack snatched two early wickets via errors from Jimmy Adams, swishing outside his off-stump, and Joe Weatherley, who pulled a ball straight into the hand of George Bartlett, meticulously placed at deep square leg seconds earlier.Now the quality stepped up. As Somerset, sniffing their third victory of the season, probed, Hampshire’s two Test batsmen, James Vince and Hashim Amla, set to work. Vince, on eight, offered a tough chance to Craig Overton in the gully but he then proceeded to bat with great composure and skill. And patience, which is a quality more readily associated with Amla, who gave the connoisseurs a treat. The Somerset bowlers made him work hard but Amla is humble enough to do that. By the close he had cruised to an unbeaten 86 while Vince had, by his standards, crawled to an excellent 63. Hence there is a way out for Hampshire, who are now just 97 runs behind.

Graham HardcastleSqueaky bum time at New Road. Worcestershire are seven down for 170, needing 45 more to beat Essex. Simon Harmer has done the most recent damage with three wickets. But in Travis Head, unbeaten on 55, and captain Joe Leach, they still have men capable of getting them home. To colleagues in the press box here at the Oval, I have just predicted the loss of Leach in the not too distant future and Head attacking as he runs out of partners to see them home. Adam Lyth has just fallen caught at slip off Amar Virdi for 58. Yorkshire 99-4.

5.42pm BST
17:42

Graham HardcastleJoe Root has been bowled through the gate by off-spinner Amar Virdi for 23, leaving Yorkshire at 66/3 in the 29th over. We still have 28 overs left to be bowled in the day. It is fair to say Virdi was pretty chuffed with that. If you want to imagine his celebration, think a cross between Monty Panesar and Imran Tahir.🙌 What a ball, what a moment for @AmarSinghVirdi.He gets the @englandcricket skipper @root66 bowled through the gate.

Graham HardcastleWorcestershire, having been 97-5 in pursuit of 215 to beat Essex at New Road, are now 140-5 as Australia’s Travis Head and Ed Barnard steady they ship. They have 38 and 26 respectively. 75 more for a first win of the season for the Pears. 

4.44pm BST
16:44

Graham HardcastleWe have our second result of the round, and it’s at Edgbaston, where Division Two leaders Warwickshire have beaten Northamptonshire by six wickets. It is their third win from four matches this summer. Here at the Oval, Yorkshire are 24-2. We still have 40 overs to bowl. 

4.12pm BST
16:12

Vic MarksAt tea Hampshire are 70-2. The cricket has been sedate but of high quality. Vince and Amla have played watchfully as the situation demands; Somerset’s England bowlers have been on target. Overton bowled much better than in the first innings; Leach was also accurate but extracted little turn. We are therefore in connoisseur country in lazy Sunday afternoon sunshine. For the first time at Taunton this summer the bowlers are going to have to toil for their wickets but Hampshire will also have to work very hard to avoid defeat here. Like many others around the country this is a good game.

4.04pm BST
16:04

Graham HardcastleThe champions are fighting hard. Worcestershire are now 68-4 and still 147 away from their target against Essex at New Road, with Peter Siddle doing the early damage with three wickets, including that of Joe Clarke lbw for two. In Division Two, Sussex are 88-4 chasing 270 against Kent at Canterbury. Matt Henry has two, with everything he touches turning to gold at present. Warwickshire are on the verge of beating Northamptonshire. They are 23 away with six wickets in hand. Here at The Oval, Yorkshire are 15-2 in their second innings. Joe Root has two of them, a dab wide of slips.

3.45pm BST
15:45

Graham HardcastleYorkshire’s batting troubles continue. They are 10-2 in their second innings. Jade Dernbach and Sam Curran have removed Alex Lees (caught at second slip) and Che Pujara (bowled off an inside edge) to bring captain Joe Root to the crease. Whatever they do, the White Rose county can’t seem to get going with the bat. It’s a long standing problem and one that has left coaches and players scratching their heads. 

3.29pm BST
15:29

Vic MarksThe pitch has flattened here but Somerset have a second wicket, one that Joe Weatherley will want to erase from his memory. Not much was happening against tight bowling especially from Tim Groenewald. Then Abell and Groenewald decided to send George Bartlett towards the square leg boundary. With great precision Bartlett was stationed about 15 yards inside the rope and next ball Groenewald, who has never been a speedster (except when holding the bat) dug the ball in. Weatherley pulled and Bartlett did not have to move an inch to take the catch. So now Hampshire’s key batsmen, Vince and Amla, are together. 48-2

3.08pm BST
15:08

Graham HardcastleYorkshire are all out for 229 and will follow-on, 185 runs behind. We still have 57 overs left in the day, not taking into account a possible extra half hour. Sorry to be pessimistic, Yorkshire fans. Sam Curran has finished with six wickets and has just taken his 100th in first-class cricket, the fourth youngest Surrey player to achieve that feat. He turns 20 in June.

2.43pm BST
14:43

Vic MarksAdams has played a loose swish outside the off-stump and has been caught behind off Gregory. So Vince is at the crease early. I wonder whether what he does here will influence the selectors, who announce the Test squad on Tuesday or have they already reached their conclusions? Of those on the outside Clarke, Gubbins, Jennings, Burns and Foakes have all scored recent runs - and so has Hildreth. Vince has hit one delicious shot to the boundary. I leave you to ponder what it was. 24-1

2.33pm BST
14:33

Graham HardcastleJonny Bairstow has just fallen for 95 to Jade Dernbach, caught at first slip by Rikki Clarke on the drive. Yorkshire are 203-9, with Surrey set to choose whether to bat again. I wouldn’t, not in a million years.

2.28pm BST
14:28

Graham HardcastleWorcestershire are chasing 215 at New Road as they bid to inflict a second successive defeat upon champions Essex. They hadn’t lost in 19 before last week’s heist by Yorkshire at Chelmsford. The hosts are currently 11-0. Here, Jonny Bairstow is in the early nineties (93 to be precise), with Yorkshire 197-8. They need 68 more to avoid the follow-on.

2.15pm BST
14:15

Vic MarksSomerset all out for 506. Bess was bowled by a trimmer from Berg for 94, Groenewald, one of the better No 11s on the circuit, hit 25 in no time. So the lead is 275. Now we wait to see whether fresh bowlers can find life in a pitch that is now pale green. 

1.50pm BST
13:50

We are taking lunch here, slightly late given there are 104 overs to be bowled in the day. Yorkshire are 176-7 with Jonny Bairstow unbeaten on 87. Five-wicket star Sam Curran was capped as the players left the field. It looks an absolute corker at New Road, where Essex are 266-8 at lunch, leading Worcestershire by 205. You wait ages for one defeat and then two come along once. Potentially, I stress, for the champions.👍 What a way to top off a brilliant session for @CurranSM, he received his Club Cap, presented by Club Captain @roryburns17. #SpecialDay #3Feathers pic.twitter.com/4D6ahRxoEpWe have one result in around the circuit, with Lancashire beating leaders Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. Former Durham pair Graham Onions and Keaton Jennings were their stars with nine wickets in the match and a century respectively.Speaking of Durham, in Division Two, they are 217-5 in reply to Derbyshire’s 417 at the County Ground. Graham Clark has top-scored so far with 63, but he’s out. Leaders Warwickshire are wobbling at 44-3 chasing 179 against Northamptonshire at Edgbaston – Ben Sanderson with all three wickets. Sussex will chase 270 to beat Kent at Canterbury, with that pursuit just about to start. Like at New Road, that looks a belter of a finish. The same at Grace Road, where Leicestershire are 191-7, leading Glamorgan by 204. At Lord’s, Gloucestershire at 107-3 replying to Middlesex’s 455/8 declared.Updated

Vic MarksIt’s been a romp for Somerset in an elongated session. Hildreth and Dom Bess, an imposter at No 10, added 145 together as the pitch ran out of malice and the Hampshire bowlers – with the exception of Fidel Edwards who kept steaming in to no great effect – ran out of puff. At lunch Somerset sit pretty on 472-9, a lead of 241.Hildreth has been the more measured of the two. He knows how to capitalise. This was the 15th time he had passed 150 out of his 43 hundreds. Then in the last over before lunch on 184 he mishit a high full toss from Tom Alsop, a very occasional left-armer, to mid-on. How fortunate for Somerset that they are unlikely to be deprived of Hildreth’s services once the Tests start, how unjust that he has never played a match for England, though he represented the Lions on a regular basis a few years ago. His self-deprecating manner may not have endeared him to the men that matter, I suppose.We know the powers that be like the buzz and business of Bess, who will surely not bat in double figures again for Somerset. He has a first class hundred to his name for the MCC against Essex in Barbados in March. At lunch he was unbeaten on 84 and he may have the chance top register his first one for Somerset after the break.With the sun out the demons seem to have departed so we expect plenty from Bess and Leach with the ball before long.

Graham HardcastleYorkshire have lost two more quickly, Jack Leaning for 20 lbw to Rikki Clarke and Tim Bresnan caught at second slip off Sam Curran for one, to slip to 158-7, still 107 runs away from the follow-on target. Curran has five wickets, and Jonny Bairstow is still there on 76.

Glamorgan are turning things around at Grace Road and have taken five this morning, with Leicestershire 158-7 and leading by 171. Michael Hogan has four-for. Here, Jonny ploughs on, although helped by a missed opportunity from Jade Dernbach (one-handed to his right) off his own bowling on 66. He has 74 of 154-5. Yorkshire need to reach 265 to avoid the follow-on.

And Lancashire have won by an innings and 67 at Trent Bridge, bowling Notts out for 138 in their second innings. 6-55 for Onions and 4-26 for Anderson. That is Lancashire’s first away win in the Championship since July 2015 against Glamorgan at Colwyn Bay when Ashwell Prince and Alviro Petersen put on 501 for the fourth wicket - also an innings win.Updated

Vic MarksGreetings from Taunton, where Somerset are attacking the second new ball – there haven’t been many of those unwrapped here this season. Jack Leach lost his off stump to the old ball, not playing a shot. Obviously he was trying to play too responsibly. Against the new one the runs have flowed. Hildreth purrs on and Dom Bess is not really a number ten. In fact the names of Somerset’s batsmen from 7-10 (mind you Groenewald at 11 is not so bad) could be put into a hat to sort out the order. Just enjoyed a magnificent slice of coffee and walnut cake produced, if not cooked, by our press box doyen and host, Richard Walsh. What a fine start to the day.

11.44am BST
11:44

Graham HardcastleI mentioned in the scene-setter that Doug Bracewell had to back up his first-innings 81 to give Northamptonshire a realistic chance of victory over Warwickshire at Edgbaston. Well, he’s gone for seven, caught behind off Olly Stone. Northants are 179/8, leading by 170. Here, Yorkshire are five down having lost Harry Brook, caught behind off Sam Curran for 17. They are 86/5, and Jonny Bairstow has 33 of them in typically pugnacious fashion.

11.13am BST
11:13

Graham HardcastleJoe Root has gone to the day’s sixth ball from Sam Curran. He’s been trapped lbw playing around his front pad for 14 having faced the second half of the over. Jonny Bairstow joins Harry Brook at the crease, and Yorkshire are 41/4. 

10.36am BST

Graham HardcastleSaturday was a day for two centurions who are very much in the category of England hopefuls; Keaton Jennings for Lancashire against Nottinghamshire and Joe Clarke for Worcestershire against Essex. On Sunday, the current Test captain will hope to match them as Yorkshire bid to stave off a Surrey charge towards victory here.Joe Root will begin day three unbeaten on 14 with his side at 40/3 in reply to Surrey’s 414. Jonny Bairstow is still to come as well, and the White Rose will need them both to perform. The general consensus is that this is a new ball pitch, so the first hour or so will be very interesting.Both Jennings and Clarke, Lions team-mates, scored their second successive centuries. Jennings helped put Lancashire in control at Trent Bridge, with Notts 106/5 in their second innings and still 99 runs behind. That one could easily be done by lunch. It would not be a great surprise to see the left-hander named in Ed Smith’s first Test squad later this week. Clarke’s inclusion, surely ahead of James Vince if anything, would be a touch more left field. But why not?His Worcester side just about have the edge against Essex, who will resume day three on 143/4 in their second innings with a lead of 82. Alastair Cook was out for 66 late on last night.James Hildreth will resume unbeaten on 125 for Somerset (324/7) against Hampshire (231) at Taunton. England chance passed him by? Probably, yes, although many will put him in the unlucky bracket.In Division Two, like here at the Oval where rain damaged day two, they will get under way at Lord’s between Middlesex and Gloucestershire. The hosts declared on 455/8 before rain arrived at lunch. Leicestershire (191 and 119/2) are on top against Glamorgan (178) at Grace Road with a lead of 132, as are Kent (215 and 125/4) against Sussex (181) at Canterbury. They lead by 159. The draw looks favourite between Derbyshire (427) and Durham (115/2) at the County Ground.And finally, Division Two pacesetters Warwickshire are on course to win again, with Northamptonshire struggling at Edgbaston. They are 160/7 in their second innings with a lead of 151. New Zealand all-rounder Doug Bracewell is at the crease. If he can match his first-innings 81, they could be in business. Updated

The Royal London Cup north group table is beginning to take on a shape and it’s something of a surprising one. Worcestershire lead it with three wins from four matches, the latest over Lancashire. In a match reduced to 48 overs per side, one could argue that the visitors were winning it for all but the last three balls (I understand that one of the supposed benefits of The 100 is a more straightforward answer to the question: “Who’s winning?” Good luck with that one). But Darryl Mitchell had anchored the chase with an old-school 102* off 118 balls (breaking a run of poor form) and had put on 58 for the seventh wicket with Ed Barnard and, bolstered by a couple of boundaries and a wide in that last over, 104 for the eighth wicket with skipper Joe Leach to see Worcestershire home. Mitchell, Barnard and Leach are not the kind of cricketers who will appear on posters for the T20 Blast or The 100 but, having spent the week watching England’s abject display at Lord’s, I’m happy to confirm they are the kind of cricketers I like to watch.Derbyshire share the same record as Worcestershire, rounding out an unlikely pairing at the top of the table. It was a particularly good week for Luis Reece, who backed up his 9-0-43-2 and 92 in a tight win over Durham, with 7-0-37-3 in another squeaker, this time over Leicestershire. Reece had looked like the Next Big Thing for Lancashire when he broke into the side in 2013, an opening batsman who could bowl a bit – one of those with a game that reminded me of those many League type pros who have worn the Red Rose over the last 150 years. His career stalled, he dropped off scorecards and it took a move to nearby Derbyshire in 2016 to revive his fortunes. Like many of the cricketers highlighted in this column, Reece is probably a notch below international level but, still only 27, his resourcefulness is ideally suited to the county game. And there is, despite the naysayers’ relentless tinkering that devalues domestic competitions, nothing wrong with that.Nottinghamshire became the first team to pile up 400 runs in a One-Day Cup innings this season, finishing on 409-7 against Leicestershire, who also gave it a go, but fell 93 runs short. After Riki Wessels and Tom Moores had each biffed 76, with 17 fours and six sixes between them, Samit Patel gave us another reminder of his, er, huge talent with a round 100 off 63 balls (10-0-52-2 wasn’t bad with the ball either). But that’s the kind of output you get from Samit, his ODI figures backing up his obvious class (482 runs at 32.1 and a strike rate of 93.2 with the bat; 24 wickets at an economy rate of 5.5 with the ball, all done before the “No Fear” era of England white ball cricket, his last match some five years in the past now). But Samit is a classic example of the need to avoid the glass-half-empty perspective – we should not lament his slightly underwhelming 60 appearances for England but celebrate his 16 years and counting at Trent Bridge.Hampshire lead the South Group table by a single point, but it could have been three were it not for a remarkable final over from Kiwi speedster Matt Henry. Joe Weatherley had batted beautifully to register a maiden senior century and, with four to get off the last six balls, the bat was strongly favoured over the ball. Four dots later, he could only get a single from the fifth delivery and Lewis McManus, new to the crease, could not score the boundary required off the last ball. One feels for the 21-year-old, who had been in the middle for 35 overs and just celebrated the milestone, but there is nothing more important in the 50th over of a chase, with bat or ball in hand, than a clear mind and a clear plan. Henry and his captain, Joe Denly, can reflect on a job well done for Kent but Weatherley will be back and all the better for the experience.Somerset went level on points with Middlesex just one behind Hampshire with a victory that showed the benefit of having bowling options available for the captain. Lewis Gregory, having opened the bowling himself, whistled up five team-mates to have a go and they all chipped in with at least one wicket and none were collared, Jamie Overton’s economy rate of 7.0 the most expensive. Gregory had the luxury of ignoring his seventh bowler, Johann Myburgh’s handy off-breaks not required. In the era of batsmen-wicketkeepers, many of whom have grown up with a licence to tee off, some teams have as many as three in their line-up – and see Ball Three above for Riki Wessels’ effectiveness on the biff. That said, captains must be wary of squeezing their bowling options, six surely being a minimum in the 50-overs format.It was a Bank Holiday Monday and the weather was fine. Just the kind of day that might lend itself to a few hours watching the cricket, perhaps at an outground with a festival atmosphere and a glass of Pimm’s in hand. But there was no cricket to watch – anywhere. Thanks for that, ECB.• This article appeared first on The 99.94 Cricket Blog• Follow Gary Naylor on Twitter"

Soon after 10am, the Irish players gathered together on the outfield while the chair of selectors, Andrew White, set down a scruffy cardboard box full of handsome new caps. He handed them out one by one, the first to captain William Porterfield, then the rest in alphabetical order, Andy Balbirnie, Ed Joyce, Tyrone Kane, Tim Murtagh, Kevin and Niall O’Brien, Boyd Rankin, Paul Stirling, Stuart Thompson and Gary Wilson. The first Irish Test XI. At least a couple of them started to cry from pride. Then, their coach, Graham Ford, cut them short. “Let’s get moving.”The Irish cricket community is small, but proud and enthusiastic. Over the years a lot of boys and men who love or loved the game have entertained daydreams of playing in a Test match for Ireland. In their minds, it might have looked just like this Saturday. A bright, warm May morning at the pretty little ground, hardly a cloud in the sky, and 5,000 fans in the grandstands, family and friends and team-mates all around and the opposition reeling. This after Porterfield, following Friday’s washout, had won the toss, and became the first captain to choose to bowl in his country’s first Test.Porterfield’s side were stacked with right-arm medium-fast bowlers, his two openers, Murtagh and Rankin, much the best and most experienced of them. The next, Thompson and Kane, have played a handful of first-class games between them, and the last, Kevin O’Brien, is strictly part-time. But Pakistan’s batting line-up was callow, too. They had given a debut to Imam-ul-Haq and Faheem Ashraf, their No3, Haris Sohail has played two Tests before this, and their No5, Babar Azam, 11. The pitch was damp and grassy and Porterfield reckoned Pakistan’s batsmen might be vulnerable.Porterfield was right. They looked nervous from the first ball, which was a slapstick bit of business. Murtagh, ever so tense after the “spine-tingling” cap ceremony, over-pitched so the delivery landed right up by Azhar Ali’s feet.“That first ball is something I’ve been thinking about for a while,” Murtagh said. He’d been telling himself to “bowl a magic ball, bowl a magic ball” and instead “I missed my length by about a yard” so it came out as a floaty yorker. Azhar patted the ball down to the ground, stared at it for a split second, then set off on a quick single.Imam came haring up from the non-striker’s end and as he dived for the line he collided with both the keeper, Niall O’Brien and Kane, who was sprinting in from square-leg. Imam was knocked flat and for a moment it looked like he might be seriously injured. He passed his concussion test though and was back on his feet and batting again five minutes later. As Murtagh said: “The first ball in Test cricket’s probably never taken so long.”In the stands, everyone seemed to know each other, but not what to expect from this Test. The Irish crowd know the game, and love it, so were quick and keen to applaud Imam when he hit the first four, through cover. They were quicker and keener, mind, when Rankin got Azhar out soon after, caught at second slip, and then Murtagh dismissed Imam lbw with the next ball. Murtagh was bowling brilliantly and almost had Asad Shafiq caught at slip later in the over.Porterfield chose this as the moment to make his first change and brought on Kane. A group of his club-mates were watching, unable to believe that their pal, a 23-year-old who has not played so much as a county match, was now a Test cricketer.They seemed every bit as nervous for him as he must have felt himself. Kane started with a no-ball but after that he settled into it well, his second over a maiden. As Porterfield said, he bowled better than his final figures, 18-2-84-0, suggested.As the morning wore on, Pakistan rallied, and Shafiq and Sohail batted through to lunch.The afternoon ebbed and flowed. Thompson found that Test cricket was as easy as whanging the ball down and waiting for the batsmen to play a bad shot. He had Sohail caught in the gully and Sarfraz in the slips. In between, Murtagh got Azam and Rankin did for Shafiq, who was the only man in the top order who settled. Shafiq put together a careful 62 before Rankin switched to bowling short and had him caught at square-leg.At that point Pakistan were 159 for six. But they finished well. Faheem and Shadab Khan rattled their way to half-centuries so by the close they were 268 for six, as Ireland’s fielders flapped at a couple of catches. It had been a long day, the first of many."

Surrey flogged 20 wickets out of the Oval square in smashing a strong Yorkshire side by an innings well inside three days playing time. That’s the kind of result that catches the eye of an England captain – though, since Joe Root was in the middle for much of the match, he could hardly have missed it. That said, missing the ball got him out twice, LBW to Sam Curran for 14 and bowled through the gate by Amar Virdi for 23. The current pride of English batsmanship dismissed twice by teenagers in the same match? It can’t have happened too many times in the past. On first sight of a schoolboy Sam Curran’s skiddy pace and swing, delivered left-arm and supplemented by handy batting, I said that I’ve never been more certain that I was watching a future England player – good judges told me something similar about Virdi last season too.Nottinghamshire ran into the oldest swingers in town, as Jimmy Anderson and Graham Onions shared 15 wickets to register a first notch in Lancashire’s win column. Both will be 36 years of age before the season is out, but as the aches and pains pile up in the body, so too does the nous in the brain. Onions might still be playing for England were it not for the injuries that blighted a career that barely got started before it was curtailed – and he should still be playing for Durham, but, understandably, he joined the exodus, albeit a year later than some, after the crash of 2016. Onions’ beautifully balanced run-up has been praised by Michael Holding – who knows a bit about that sort of thing – and he’s never been less that a delight to watch going about his work exactly as northern seamers should. Seeing two master craftsmen in tandem must be a thrill for Red Rose fans – but will it happen again this season? Lancashire climb into the mid-table mire, while Notts stay top.Essex bounced back from last week’s defeat with a win over rock bottom Worcestershire in one of those low scoring matches in which something always seems to be happening. For once, it wasn’t Jamie Porter in tandem with Simon Harmer in sharing 10 second-innings wickets evenly, but Aussie, Peter Siddle, who signed off his county cricket stint with a fivefer. The wholehearted Victorian is 33 now and it’ll take an unexpected turn of events in Australian cricket to see him back in the Baggy Green – but stranger, far stranger, things have happened. He has a few years left in his boots, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see him follow fellow quick and vegan, Jason Gillespie, and go into coaching when he does.Warwickshire opened up a 15-point gap at the top of Division Two with what eventually proved to be a comfortable win over Northamptonshire. But there are few gifts these days, even in Division Two, as Steven Crook and Doug Bracewell put on 122 for the eighth wicket in Northants’ first innings and Tim Ambrose and Henry Brookes cobbled together 95 for the ninth wicket in the Bears’ reply. In the fourth-innings chase, it still needed an undefeated stand of 86 between youngsters Will Rhodes and Matt Lamb to bring the win home in the Midlands battle, the match finishing with Warwickshire 180-4. Rhodes moved from Yorkshire to get more cricket and a round 100 not out opening is a pretty good vindication of that decision. Given the fragility of Yorkshire’s batting, they might want him back when his two years contract at Edgbaston expires.At various times in the scorecard read:Leicestershire 67-6Leicestershire 191, Glamorgan 90-1Leicestershire 191, Glamorgan 178, Leicestershire 127-2Leicestershire 191, Glamorgan 178, Leicestershire 158-7Leicestershire 191, Glamorgan 178, Leicestershire 237, Glamorgan 139-8Leicestershire 191, Glamorgan 178, Leicestershire 237, Glamorgan 247-9Marchant de Lange’s five fours and eight sixes got the Welshmen to within a blow of a victory, but the South African quick was caught on the boundary going for glory and the home side won by three runs.Here’s some of what Paul Nixon, “The Badger” who is now installed as coach at Leicestershire, had to say: “It was an unbelievable game of cricket, absolutely extraordinary – the fight shown by both sides. It swung one way and the other from the first day on. I’m almost speechless. Championship cricket is the truest test, physically and mentally, and to come out on top at the end, there’s nothing like it.”After a few months in which red-ball cricket appears to be undergoing a slow motion nervous breakdown, a County Championship Division Two match retains the power to render the garrulous Nixon speechless – well, almost. Keep saying it Nico – and it might be useful if others (who should know better) could talk the game up a bit too.There’s always been a reason not to pick James Hildreth for England: his numbers are too “Taunton”; his time has passed; there’s another whose form is just that bit better. He could be forgiven for believing that the main reason James Hildreth doesn’t get picked is that he’s “James Hildreth, Somerset (and not England)”, and that’s just the way things are. His second century of the season, a daddy 184, was supported by 80 from Craig Overton and 92 from Dom Bess (like Theresa May, cruelly hiding at No10) proved enough to lift Somerset above 500. Hampshire, 275 behind, needed some big knocks to save the game and they got them, with a century for Hashim Amla and a double from James Vince (England’s latest No3) proving the Curse of Hildreth once again.• This article appeared first on The 99.94 Cricket Blog• Follow Gary Naylor on Twitter"

Joe Root has admitted his frustration at not being able to find form for Yorkshire during their past two County Championship games, although the England Test captain was at least able to take a glimpse into the future having seen Ollie Pope and Sam Curran shine for Surrey during their innings victory achieved on the morning of day four.Root’s brief return to county colours before the international summer has yielded scores of 0, 35, 14 and 23 in a victory against Essex at Chelmsford and defeat here. He will now turn his attentions to squad selection for the first Test against Pakistan a week on Thursday and meet the new national selector Ed Smith on Tuesday.“When you come back to Yorkshire, you want to perform and give a bit back to the side. It’s been a little bit disappointing,” said Root, who led Yorkshire at the Oval owing to Gary Ballance’s illness. “But that’s cricket, it can be challenging.“I didn’t come into these games to get ready for the Test matches. I made sure I did my preparation beforehand to try to perform well for Yorkshire. It’s just not materialised, unfortunately. That’s just how it can go.”Root and the Yorkshire coach, Andrew Gale, bemoaned missed opportunities in the field during the first day as the primary reason for their defeat, with the 20-year-old Pope nearly run out on the way to a career‑best 158 not out as Surrey recovered from 162 for six to post 414 on a pitch which offered help for the seamers all the way through. This was their second win from four matches.Alongside Pope, their other hero was the 19-year-old left-arm seamer Curran, who claimed six wickets in the first innings and finished with his first 10-wicket match haul – 10 for 101.Root said: “Their two young lads were very impressive. On a wicket that offered a bit, Ollie played really well. He has a good all‑round game and put our bowlers under pressure. Sam bowled nicely. To back it up having enforced the follow-on was impressive.”Meanwhile, both of the remaining Division two games ended in draws, despite the best efforts of Mark Wood who, in his first game since leaving the IPL early, took a career-best 6-46 for Durham in Derbyshire’s second innings. Wood reverse-swung the ball with alacrity, but Derby resisted on a dry pitch, finishing on 279 for 9.At Lord’s, 21-year-old wicketkeeper James Bracey saved the game for Gloucestershire with an unbeaten 125 against Middlesex, his third Championship century. “It’s good enough just to play at Lord’s,” he said. “I wanted to enjoy the occasion and I’ve surpassed myself, so I’m really happy.” Bracey, who was born in Bristol and is in the final year of his degree at Loughborough University, signed a two-summer contract with Gloucestershire in March.At the end of the first five rounds of Championship games, Nottinghamshire and Worcestershire top and tail Division One; Warwickshire and Northamptonshire Division Two. The next round of matches begins on 9 June.Kevin O’Brien produced another memorable international century to leave Ireland’s inaugural Test with Pakistan fascinatingly poised following the hosts’ spirited fourth-day fightback.Seven years after O’Brien smashed the quickest World Cup ton in a match-winning innings against England, he went into three figures again, making 118 not out as Ireland, who had been made to follow-on, progressed to 319 for seven – a 139-run lead.With showers possible today, all results still appear possible when it had seemed like a Pakistan victory was a foregone conclusion at the start of yesterday play.Resuming on 64 without loss, still 116 in arrears, the sight of Mohammad Amir moving gingerly due to a knee problem would have provided encouragement, particularly when he did not open the bowling. As it was, he was not needed at first. Joyce, with 43, was run out by Faheem Ashraf’s direct hit and there was a pair for Andrew Balbirnie, who was once more trapped in front by Mohammad Abbas.Niall O’Brien and Porterfield could both have been run out but did not make the most of their second lives as Amir produced a brilliant spell. Two of O’Brien’s stumps were uprooted, before Amir finally found Porterfield’s outside edge, with Sarfraz Ahmed taking a smart catch to send back Ireland’s captain for 32.Amir secured his 100th Test wicket with the dismissal of Gary Wilson with Stuart Thompson becoming victim number 101, but he, along with Kevin O’Brien, took 14 off two Amir overs to bring Ireland within touching distance of moving in front.They did so via Kevin O’Brien’s edge through the vacant second-slip region for four and the 34-year-old soon became Ireland’s first male Test half-centurion with a clip through point from his 186th ball.

With uncertainty comes excitement and there are more uncertainties than usual as England begin their Test summer. So for those of a nervous disposition let me offer one cast-iron reassurance: in the field at Lord’s England will be a more vibrant, athletic outfit than they were last winter.The newcomer and the prodigal are brilliant fielders. Dom Bess, guaranteed to play according to Joe Root on the eve of the match, is a terrific presence in the field in the ring. So too is Jos Buttler, assuming he remembers how to do it. Before he was given the gloves Buttler was also a superb outfielder, fast and with safe hands, though if his return to Test cricket becomes permanent his slip-fielding prowess may have to be explored – this is not an area in which England have excelled recently beyond second slip.Now to the unknowns: the most eye-catching selection was the return of Buttler as a specialist No 7 batsman. He has excelled in the Indian Premier League, which served as a reminder of the “unique gifts” Ed Smith referred to when announcing the squad. England have had specialist batsmen at seven before – Derek Randall, Mike Gatting, Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash have batted there – but it is hard to recall the side ever adopting the notion of a “specialist seven” with particular freedom to play in an aggressive manner, honed by white-ball cricket. This is unpredictable and appetising – though it is doubtful the Lord’s faithful will break into a slow handclap if Buttler has not played his “ramp shot” within 10 minutes of his arrival at the crease.The oddity about Bess’s selection is that he could be construed as the conservative choice once the sad news of Jack Leach’s broken thumb had surfaced. Bess toured with the Lions in the winter; he has played 16 first-class games with the astonishing return of 63 wickets at 22 apiece and he can bat a bit as well as field. His most obvious rival is Surrey’s Amar Virdi, a year younger than Bess at 19 with only seven first-class appearances for Surrey and 23 wickets at 26 apiece.Even so Bess’s elevation is incredibly rapid; he will be England’s youngest finger spinner and in first-class cricket he has seldom bowled on a pitch that does not turn, which is likely to be the case at Lord’s for at least three days. Once again here is a (glorious) uncertainty.It does not end there. It may be that Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes will be the support bowlers for Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. Like Buttler they have just flown from the IPL into a Lord’s Test without playing any red-ball cricket this season. This may well work, but it breaks with convention and it is not so hard to predict how one or two old players might riff on the impossibility of playing proper Test cricket with such scanty preparation if Stokes and Woakes bowl poorly or run out of puff in the final session.Woakes is not guaranteed to play. He is competing with Mark Wood for the last bowling slot and Root explained England would inspect the pitch early on Thursday morning before making their decision. It was tricky to inspect it on Wednesday since it was locked under a white tarpaulin and then, after a quick mow, the hover cover.Currently those covers are hiding a healthy amount of green grass but the fact that the pitch was hidden from the sun all day suggests the groundstaff are concerned that it may become too dry too quickly.The selection conundrum probably goes like this: if England think the ball is going to jag around then they are more likely to go for Woakes; if the pitch looks flat and batsman-friendly they may prefer Wood, who played in England’s last Test in Christchurch. Wood has the dubious reputation of being a better pick when his variety – the potential extra pace, his willingness to bowl bouncers – is deemed to be of greater value. A less cheerful man than Wood might then point out “I only play on the flat ’uns”.There remains more uncertainty about the opening batsmen even though Alastair Cook will be equalling the record set by Allan Border when playing his 153rd consecutive Test. The only game Cook, who has never been dropped, has missed was through illness in Mumbai in 2006, which would have been his third Test.Both sides have slumped since the drawn 2016 series here. They were vying for first place in the rankings then; now Pakistan are seventh, England fifth. Sarfraz Ahmed, a sparky captain behind the stumps, is leading a team that is rebuilding and missing one of their best bowlers, the leg-spinner Yasir Shah, because of injury.“That is why we have inducted Shadab Khan and Faheem Ashraf so we can have five bowlers”, said Sarfraz. “If we had Yasir we would have played six batsmen and a keeper with four bowlers”.Shadab, who is only 19, bowls leg-breaks, Faheem medium pace and both can be classed as all-rounders. Along with Imam-ul Haq, Inzamam’s nephew, they represent the new generation. But as with so many players in this match we have no real idea how effective they will be over the next five days."

Australia’s cricket team can expect a verbal barrage from England’s players, fans and media on their tour next month following the ball tampering scandal but new coach Justin Langer has told his side they can negate that if they behave better. Australian cricket was thrown into turmoil in late March after captain Steve Smith, vice-captain David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft conspired to illegally rough up the ball during their test series in South Africa. All three were banned afterwards, while the Australian team were criticised globally by cricket fans and commentators for what they perceived to be an arrogant and hypocritical team culture. Langer said he expected that to continue on the tour, which includes five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 match. “I am expecting to cop plenty from the crowds and the media but that’s England,” Langer said. “Even when you are winning all the time and are squeaky clean, you still cop it. We will cop it just as much as usual. But that’s okay... will be a good learning experience for our young blokes and our experienced guys will help navigate that landscape.” Langer, who replaced Darren Lehmann after the former coach quit following the scandal, had previously said the team would need to earn back the respect of the cricketing world, which could take time. He reiterated that on Saturday. “We have to aim to be number one in professionalism, number one in honesty, number one in humility,” Langer said. “It doesn’t matter how much money, how many games, how many runs you made, if you are not a good bloke that is what people remember. So if we behave well on and off the field, then hopefully we’ll earn some respect back and earn some trust back.” "

Every year in the US five people die and 10 million dollars of damage is caused as a result of deep-frying a turkey. This appears to be a festive tradition among bearded flag-draped men with hunting knives and baggy shorts, men for whom freedom’s just another word for caramelising your own arteries and shouting a lot on YouTube.But freedom comes at a cost. Each deep-fried turkey takes seven gallons of superheated fat. A special chain is required to lower it into its hell-cauldron. Moisture is the key issue: a pocket of concealed water inside the turkey can cause it to explode into a roiling spume of flames and fat.All things considered it would probably be more sensible to cook these turkeys in the oven, to play it straight. But then, you don’t get a special chain. You don’t get seven gallons of oil, or great melting mouthfuls of face-scalding fat-soaked bird, so tangy and moist and crispy-skinned you’re already salivating over it now.Bad ideas that look delicious. Delicious ideas that are – despite being delicious – also clearly very bad. Ideas that end up with everyone catching salmonella, the house on fire and England 86 for eight on a nibbly green seamer. There was a note of this in the first sight of England’s squad for the Lord’s Test against Pakistan next week; with specific reference to the gripping, oddly decadent selection of Jos Buttler as a specialist No 7 batsman, given licence to wander out, sniff the air and basically make the game up in front of him.There is a degree of natural resistance to this, a sense that to pick Buttler is to devalue decisively the proving grounds of county cricket. Buttler averages 17 in four red‑ball games over the past year. His selection is at odds with all we have heard about the informed methods of Ed Smith, out there crunching his data curves, occasionally emitting a clank of excitement over some outstanding first-innings metrics from the strangely overlooked Cakebread-Thomas of Derbyshire seconds.He could probably buy a plastic bat in the Catford branch of Sports Direct without anyone offering a yawn of recognitionInstead we have this. Faced with an ailing team and a general anxiety about how to make all forms of cricket more instantly comestible the selectors have reached for the most more-ish option; have decided, basically, to just give up and deep-fry the turkey.And yet it is undeniably the right thing to do. Not playing Buttler when you have the chance to play Buttler: that really would be weird. “He hasn’t been picked because of the IPL,” Smith said this week. But he clearly has. Buttler has been picked, in part, because he is famous, because right now he is among the top three hottest, most luminously attractive cricketers in the current edition of the sixth biggest sporting league in the world.This is simply the truth and everyone involved should embrace it, because it’s both entirely sensible and entirely consistent with the England and Wales Cricket Board’s more gimmicky attempts to popularise the game. If we’re willing to junk the basic robustness of the sport via the Hundred, to introduce the new colts cricket rules trailed this week – ditch the lbw law, double-run maxi zones in the field – then it looks like old-school good sense to pick the most pop-famous cricketer in the country as often as possible.The fact is Buttler stands outside the normal rules and numbers. This has been said before about other cricketers. But in this case it’s actually true. He was a ludicrous spectacle in the IPL this year, driving and cuffing and gliding his way to 389 runs off 258 balls at an average of 97, with that familiar, beautifully delicate kind of violence in those whip-crack wrists.It is traditional at this point to suggest batting on pitches where the ball moves, where a flighty fifty can lose a game rather than win it, is a different matter altogether. Plus Buttler has been batting with a self‑made technique in India, adopting that white‑ball power hitting stance, front leg shifted to one side so he can hit in front of square from the same base, sending the ball through the field in a weird flat, scything arc.The thing is, it works. Just as moving up to open has worked, despite the need to adapt instantly to new angles, speeds, pressures. English cricket has no history of producing unorthodox players, certainly not at this global-genius level. But for once it is perhaps simply time to go with it.The real issue around Buttler’s career isn’t his ability to defend against the swinging ball. The absurdity of mature Buttler is that he is essentially a blank in his own country, a Category A sports person in a global game who could probably walk in and buy a plastic bat in the Catford branch of Sports Direct without anyone offering a yawn of recognition.This week the chairman of the ECB told us children just don’t like cricket. This is of course dangerous nonsense. The game is good. The talent is there. But it is also invisible to swathes of the population, just as Buttler has become English sport’s great invisible superstar, hidden away behind the high hedge on the last remaining patch of green.For an industry that spends a lot of time quivering and whining about what it doesn’t have, Buttler is the asset, the talent. Centre stage may be a little left of centre these days. But it’s time to get him out there."

AB de Villiers, South Africa’s master batsman, described himself as having “run out of gas” after making the surprise decision to call time on his international career.The 34-year-old right-hander, considered among the greatest of all time by his peers, bows out 14 years on from his debut in 2004, having struck 22 centuries in 114 Tests and 25 in 228 one-day internationals. Mr 360, as he is known for a dazzling array of shots, will no longer wear the Protea on his shirt.“I have had my turn and, to be honest, I am tired,” said De Villiers in a video message posted on social media. “It’s not about earning more somewhere else. It’s about running out of gas and feeling that it is the right time to move on. Everything comes to an end.”De Villiers hopes to continue playing for the Titans in South Africa and the Guardian understands he is looking to see out the remaining two years of his Indian Premier League deal with Royal Challengers, where his £1.4m salary per season is reportedly worth seven times his international retainer.The decision to bow out from South Africa duty altogether - rather than specialise in a particular format, perhaps with an eye on next summer’s World Cup – is said to stem from criticism of a near two-year break from Tests from January 2016 to December 2017 and the suggestion he was “picking and choosing” his cricket.De Villiers used this exact phrase during the announcement of his international retirement on Wednesday. Despite an impressive return to Tests this year for the wins over India and Australia at home – not least the latter, where his unbeaten 126 in Port Elizabeth turned the series - this perception appears to have put him off a repeat.“It would not be right for me to pick and choose where, when and in what format I play for the Proteas. For me, in the green and gold, it must be everything or nothing. I will always be grateful to the coaches and staff of Cricket South Africa for their support through all these years,” he added.De Villiers will doubtless still attract plenty of interest abroad, as the owner of the fastest ODI century – 31 balls against West Indies in 2015 – and with a Twenty20 record that boasts 45 half-centuries and three centuries from 251 matches. The England and Wales Cricket Board will be hoping he fancies a stab at the new 100-ball cricket format in 2020, too."

A series of trial games for English cricket’s 100-ball tournament could be held in the United Arab Emirates before the end of the year as the architects of the proposed format look to set out its playing conditions in a live match situation.The England and Wales Cricket Board has already turned down an offer from Surrey to test out The Hundred at the Oval this summer and will instead look to go overseas, with the UAE emerging as a possible destination before the Lions play there in November.Of huge interest will be how the controversial 10-ball over is deployed. It was described by the tournament director, Sanjay Patel, as a “fresh tactical dimension” when the ECB announced the new format last month but has resulted in plenty of grumbling from the players.The ECB originally planned for this to sit at the end of each innings after 15 traditional six-ball overs. But other ideas include one team using it as a “wildcard” option at the behest of the batting side, or possibly 16 overs with the extra four balls used tactically within them.Ultimately the plan is to have the scorecard showing the number of balls going down in each 100-ball innings – regardless of how that number is reached – as the score goes up. One senior ECB official told the Observer this is intended “to help answer the age-old question of ‘who is winning?’” and thus simplify cricket for the uninitiated.Among the concerns of the Professional Cricketers Association currently is that, with The Hundred replacing the women’s Kia Super League, women’s cricket will lack a domestic Twenty20 tournament to mirror the format played an international level. It is understood the ECB is looking into further augmenting the Women’s County T20 Cup to address this."

Australia skipper Tim Paine expects a torrid reception from England fans and the media during next month’s one-day international tour. The wicketkeeper, who took over as Test skipper after the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa, will lead Australia’s 15-man squad for the June one-day international series.“It’s certainly going to be raised. The English are going to be basking in the glory of what’s happened,” he said in Hobart on Thursday. “Guys are certainly going to have to be ready for that.

Neehan Khaunte is into the final few hours of a family holiday in London and the best has unquestionably been saved till last. This 13-year-old from Goa cannot believe where he is and what he is watching. Wearing an England shirt, he is sitting in the lower tier of the Edrich Stand at Lord’s, his face fixed in a beatific daze. Back home Neehan is the captain of his state under-14 cricket team. He plays every day, early in the morning before school and again after school for more intensive training. Being part of the crowd watching England v Pakistan renders him virtually speechless. “We only have a few hours before the flight back to Goa but we will spend every last minute we can here at the cricket,” his father says.Seeing a child so entranced by the experience resonates. Cricket in England appears to be having a complicated existential debate with itself about how to engage with new generations of young players and cricket watchers.Colin Graves, the England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, has been ruffling feathers about the concept, The Hundred, to make the game more thrilling and fast-paced to reel in the fans of the future – kids growing up used to bite-sized highlights on a mobile phone, video games and social media flashes. A sport that can drift into slow motion as the players have a stretch and a ponder between each ball does not easily connect with shortening attention spans.“The younger generation, whether you like it or not, are just not attracted to cricket,” Graves opined. “In all the work, surveys and research we have done, the younger generation want something different. They want more excitement, they want it shorter and simpler to understand.”While being way off the age scale, Graves is targeting shorter and simpler to understand cricket and that appeals to me as I click through the turnstiles for the opening day of the first Test of the English summer.Full disclosure: I am a cricket agnostic. My spectacles are so deeply tinted in football that most other sports exist only in the blurred periphery. There was not much exposure in childhood, when I got hooked by football. French cricket in the gardens of the 1970s brought a rare example of being allowed for once to join in a version of a designated boys’ game. One memory stands out from teenagedom, of choosing to spend an entire day glued to a one-day international on television (Phil DeFreitas performed heroically) as a means of successfully procrastinating from O-level revision. I was grateful for the distraction, but not enthused enough to go back for more.As a rookie in the Lord’s crowd, the action did feel on the drawn-out side. On Thursday, Pakistan picked off most of England’s batsmen in the opening innings with speedy precision, and in between balls there was abundant time for chatter and a few sips of something or other, which seemed to be part of the attraction for many.At lunch, as the picnics were unfurled, a group of children were ushered on to the grass to showpiece cricket’s commitment to capturing the imagination of the next generation. They were all wearing their All Stars gear, pale blue tops and caps, as they enthusiastically demonstrated rudimentary bowling, batting and fielding skills.After lunch, a group of schoolchildren in block L began to cheer and wave at any players in the vicinity. They loved holding up cards with 4 or 6 on either side to honour a fine boundary. Charlie, from nearby UCS, was part of a trip that invited the under-11 A and B teams to get to smell professional cricket at close quarters. “I have played nearly all my life,” he said. “I love the excitement. You are in the sun. It is exhilarating because it’s not predictable. You think a lot. Cricket is a great game and anybody should try it.”The coach, James, can only see the benefit of coming to somewhere like Lord’s. “We show the boys a lot of videos of techniques so to see it in person is great. And this is a magical place.”The traditionalists appear wedded to the notion that cricket is best appreciated slowly. That dilemma – whether to remain true to the authentic style or evolve into something more energised – feels generational and perhaps in a way geographical too.Hebbani is from Bangalore and raves about how the IPL has regenerated cricket in India. “The Twenty20 matches are full of fours and sixes and runs and runs and runs,” he enthuses. “All the matches are in the evening and in front of crowds of 40,000 or 50,000, it is electrifying. Music, dance, cheerleaders, lights, everything on the screen. It has transformed the way cricket is played and the pool of players.”English cricket still seems to be unsure about its most productive path. A day at Lord’s remains something old-fashioned, rooted in its own ways. The crowd retains its own idiosyncratic flavour, sights and sounds that are particular to cricket, with an unfeasibly large red trouser count, every shade of beige and cream mixed in with the egg and bacon stripes of the MCC, champagne corks popping on to the fringe of the grass. “Just wondering whether to Bloody Mary or not to Bloody Mary,” is not the first sentence you would expect to overhear entering a football ground.Time will tell whether Graves’s Hundred is a curious gimmick or a brave new enticing world."

Bill Lawry is putting down the the microphone after four decades of cricket commentary for the Nine Network. The 81-year-old confirmed on Tuesday he had turned down offers from Fox Sports and the Seven Network, opting for retirement after Nine’s loss in April of cricket media rights.“I’ve had 40 great years at Channel Nine and I’ve been very, very lucky ... I don’t want to spoil a great journey,” he told SEN’s Whateley program.Lawry said he viewed Nine as a “home” where he’d been very happy since his recruitment by Kerry Packer in the 1970s to commentate World Series Cricket.“Packer called us together way back there in 1975-76. I remember Keith Stackpole and I went to the first meeting or two and we said this will only last for a couple of years – let’s enjoy ourselves,” he said. “So we were way off the mark there.”The former Australian Test captain credited Nine with helping to revolutionise cricket by bringing the modern game into people’s homes.Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day“The replays, the third umpires, stump-cam, Greiggie and his pitch report way back in the early days – sticking a key into the pitch – brought to the people just how Test cricket was played,” he said.“It was new territory for everybody.

No one really knows why a cricket ball swings. It is a problem that foxes the finest scientific minds, as much of a conundrum as the true size of the universe, the life-span of a proton and quite why James Hildreth has never been picked for England.Oh, the mechanics of the movement are clear enough. That is all to do with what they call laminar flow, the way the air passes over the two sides of the ball. But the when and the where of it, why one ball should swing and another not, why certain grounds should be especially conducive to it, whether the weather has any effect or what that effect might be – all that is a mystery.Cricketers say it is to do with how hot and humid the day is. But a lot of scientific studies have been done to determine just how much difference those two things make to the trajectory of a ball and the answer is none at all. The most recent one, at Sheffield Hallam in 2012, concluded that, if the atmospheric conditions do have anything to do with when and whether the ball swings, it is not because of the humidity but something else altogether. “It is proposed that new avenues for investigation should focus on how differing levels of cloud cover may affect localised air turbulence.”Which sounds like academic for “we don’t know”. England did not come any closer to an answer on Friday morning. They spent a lot of the day wrestling with the swing problem and did not come any closer to solving it than the engineers and scientists at Sheffield Hallam. Pakistan’s novice attack made the ball hoop around on Thursday. They have 40 caps between them. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad have played more Test matches here than that, never mind in the rest of the world. The conditions were similar, thick, sticky and still, but they could not get the ball to move nearly so much as Pakistan had.England expected it to swing. Broad and Anderson tried to do it. Anderson was hit for a couple of fine drives by Haris Sohail as he floated the ball up full to give it every chance to do its thing. He got so fed up with it all that he banged the next ball in short and hit Sohail in the ribs.England did a lot of that as the morning wore on. Once they realised the ball was not swinging they quickly decided to switch to plan B, which meant peppering the batsmen with bouncers and pestering the umpires to switch this ball for another, one that might move in the air.The plan worked on the batsmen better than it did on the umpires. Mark Wood softened Sohail up with a couple of bouncers from around the wicket before he had him caught at slip off a ball that moved away down the slope. Ben Stokes bounced out Asad Shafiq, caught at slip, Sarfraz Ahmed, caught at fine leg, Shadab Khan, caught behind, and also forced Babar Azam to retire hurt by hitting him on the forearm. This is not exactly how play on a cloudy May day at Lord’s is meant to go.It all meant that England’s new young spinner Dom Bess had a lot more to do in his first Test bowling spell than one might have guessed at the start of play. Anderson and Broad are a couple of old Eeyores but Bess, 20, is supposed to be full of Tiggerish enthusiasm for the game, which is good because he will have needed every last little bit as he wheeled through plenty of thankless overs on Fridayafternoon, without so much as a sniff of spin to work with. Bess has played 16 first-class games and none of them was at Lord’s. He has not done much bowling outside Taunton, where the wickets tend to turn. So it felt as if England were asking an awful lot of him here.Bess went about it all enthusiastically enough. He has a busy run-up. He makes a brisk, determined march to the crease, cocked forward at the waist, like a geography teacher cutting through the playground to break up a fight on the far side of the yard. He works his wrist as he goes, as if readying it to grab one of the boys by the shoulders. There is a lot going on before his delivery, then, but less after it. Anderson and Stokes at least found a hint of swing from the Nursery End as the day wore on but Bess did not get a single ball to turn off the straight. It did not fizz so much as float.Bess stuck at it, though, from over and around the wicket. The Pakistani batsmen worked him this way and that and looked troubled by him only when they tried something too ambitious. Bess will hope he has more to work with in the fourth innings. The way the match has shaped so far, England will have to bat a lot better if he is going to get his wish."

Ed Smith’s first utterances as national selector are awaited with the anticipation of Greeks hastening to Delphi to listen to the oracle. As for them there is no certainty his outpourings will be understood. This is his first appearance in the role and he will already understand the business of selection is easier as a pundit than an employee of the England and Wales Cricket Board.There has been speculation about what he might do but it is only speculation. The past two national selectors, Geoff Miller and James Whitaker, were always discreet and, to the exasperation of the odd colleague, disinclined to leak. Smith is likely to operate in the same way.On Tuesday afternoon he announces the squad for the Lord’s Test against Pakistan and there are few certainties beyond the sad news that Jack Leach, who impressed in Christchurch at the beginning of April in his Test debut, will not be at Lord’s.Leach has broken his left thumb. This happened when he was practising his batting, which has improved greatly, before the start of play in Somerset’s match against Hampshire. A ball propelled by the first‑team coach, Jason Kerr, with his dog ball‑thrower, rose steeply and struck the thumb. Leach immediately headed off to the pavilion and by lunch he and his devoted colleagues’ worst fears were confirmed.In the meantime James Vince, a man always under discussion among the selectors, had reached the slowest Championship century of the season and then added another one. Somehow the slower Vince scores the higher his innings is regarded, so this was a timely effort which saved the game for Hampshire and just might have saved his Test place.It was a knock free of frills – he ended up unbeaten on 201 in the longest innings of his career (508 minutes) – that left Somerset’s captain, Tom Abell, scratching his head.Smith, too, must have done a fair bit of head-scratching in the past few weeks. Andrew Strauss spoke of “fresh ideas” on his appointment and it would be remarkable after England’s winter, in which they lost five and drew two of their Tests, if Joe Root led out a side containing all the same men. Yet it is not easy to decide whom to ditch, especially after Vince’s match-saving knock at Taunton allied with the fact he scored 76 in his last Test innings.It is now more likely that Alastair Cook, who surely will survive despite only one score of more than 37 in his 15 Test innings last winter (it was an unbeaten 244 in Melbourne) will have yet another partner. Mark Stoneman has struggled this summer and, even though his most recent Test score (60) is his highest, Smith along with Trevor Bayliss, Angus Fraser and Mick Newell may try a different left-hander. The candidates are Middlesex’s Nick Gubbins, Keaton Jennings of Lancashire and Stoneman’s Surrey partner, Rory Burns.If Vince or Dawid Malan does not survive, then Worcestershire’s Joe Clarke, unlike Lancashire’s Liam Livingstone, has scored timely runs now that the sun has come out. The other possibility is to remove the gloves from Jonny Bairstow and tell him to bat at No 5 (mind you, he could keep wicket from there). This would enable Ben Foakes to be drafted into the side.This is a strategy fast gaining popularity though probably not in the Bairstow household. Unless Smith really is silky‑tongued then he is probably not able to persuade Bairstow of the wisdom of this move. And does he want to alienate one of his best players? It would, however, constitute a “fresh idea”.So would summoning up Jos Buttler, who has hit a rich vein of form, albeit in that abbreviated, old-fashioned form of the game.Selectors are usually more prepared to juggle with their bowling attack, an area where England lack variety when the ball stops moving in the air or off the pitch. With Leach out, Moeen Ali is more likely to be summoned back from India unless they decide to take a punt on one of two raw off-spinners, Surrey’s Amar Virdi or Somerset’s Dom Bess, who toiled without reward in Leach’s absence at Taunton.Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad will be on parade. They must also decide whether to recall Chris Woakes, who seems to function better with a red ball in England than anywhere else. Craig Overton has not been at his best, which means they might seek variety in the pace of Mark Wood or Olly Stone or the slower left‑arm swing of Sam Curran, who may well have impressed the England captain at the Oval over the past few days.Possible squadCook, Gubbins, Vince, Root, Malan, Stokes, Bairstow, Moeen Ali, Woakes, Curran S, Wood, Broad, Anderson"

A post-tea collapse, triggered by Mohammad Abbas and Hasan Ali, two pacemen of Pakistan who look tailor-made for English conditions, punctured any early-summer optimism in the home camp in the space of seven overs.The stands were full as the final session began since this was no time for gossiping with old friends out the back. The Royals were dominating everyone’s attention again – the Rajasthan Royals, that is. The score was a less than satisfactory 165 for five but in the 20 minutes before tea Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler, fresh from the Indian Premier League, had hinted at a glorious Tamasha after tea. Buttler had cruised to 13 in no time while Stokes, in exemplary Test fashion, had reached 36. It was compulsory to be back in the bucket seats in time for the resumption.Instead of a dazzling Bollywood counterattack, there was a horror show of X-certificate proportions. Five wickets fell for 19 runs and England were bowled out for a paltry 184, not what Joe Root had anticipated when winning the toss.This ugly procession began with a shrewd review by Pakistan against Stokes. When the delivery from Abbas struck Stokes’s pad the naked eye suggested that the ball must have pitched outside his leg stump; the replay demonstrated otherwise, providing a reminder that Abbas gets commendably close to the stumps upon delivery. Two balls later Buttler flashed hard against Hasan and Asad Shafiq held a stinging catch at second slip. The Royals had been dethroned.There was no wagging of the tail. Dom Bess, after clipping his first Test boundary, was caught at second slip; Stuart Broad was so lbw that he did not bother to review even though there were still two available and Mark Wood had an unsuccessful swish. The spectators had been glued to their seats for the wrong reasons.Not that the upper order had offered much reassurance. Without a resolute 70 from Alastair Cook, only the third time he has passed 50 in his last 25 Test innings (on the other two occasions he scored 243 and 244 not out), England might have been fielding before tea.After an early stream of boundaries Cook recognised the problem. The ball was swinging on to a surface that had retained a tinge of green despite the dryness of the soil underneath, which meant that the captain winning the toss did not have an easy decision to make.So Cook set out to blunt a probing Pakistan attack. His feet moved more positively than in New Zealand, with the right one further down the track to the fuller deliveries, which were frequent since the bowlers recognised the virtue of pitching full with the Duke ball swinging obediently.The others were nowhere near as reassuring as Cook. Mark Stoneman was dismissed by a good ball from Abbas but he should not have been bowled by it – lbw might have been a better dismissal. He pushed away from his body and the ball crept through the gate that had been created. He did not look in great form; accomplished Test players can cope with that but Stoneman has yet to graduate to that level.Root was the most obviously culpable of the batsmen. Having been tied down for 23 balls he swished at a very wide swinging delivery from Hasan and Sarfraz Ahmed gleefully accepted the catch in front of first slip. Dawid Malan, on the back foot, edged his third delivery. The suspicion remains that his technique is better suited to the truer, bouncier surfaces of Australia.Jonny Bairstow suggested permanence alongside Cook but was bowled for 27 by the first ball of a new spell from Faheem Ashraf. There followed a brisk 49-run partnership between Cook and Stokes, who hit the solitary six of the day off the leg-spinner Shadab Khan – it was not a day for a tweaker of any sort. Then Cook, stuck on the crease, was bowled by a trimmer from Amir that beat his outside edge. Arguably the best ball of the day had dismissed the day’s best batsman. A little flurry from Stokes and Buttler and the innings was over.All the while Pakistan had been disciplined and patient in the field. Their quartet of pacemen bowled full enough to allow the ball to swing – and they received excellent support, a flying catch at mid-on by Amir to polish off the innings reflecting that.Batting was not much easier when Pakistan came out in gloomy conditions, with Broad, striding in from the Nursery End, offering the greatest threat. He removed Imam-ul-Haq, lbw after a review.Later Haris Sohail, on 16, was dropped off the bowling of Wood, who had been preferred to Chris Woakes in the morning; Stokes, poaching a catch that should have been destined for Malan at second slip, was the unlikely culprit. That aside Azhar Ali and Sohail batted with discretion, fine judgment and hope in the last hour to take Pakistan to 50 for one at stumps. You always bat with hope having bowled the opposition out for 184. On Friday the tourists can add expectation."

So, at last, England win a session, and all because Ed Smith opted to go west in search of a young man to bowl some spin. Dom Bess hasn’t taken a Test wicket yet, but he has made a fifty – and proved that he can stand the heat in a kitchen which, when he walked in, had all the smoke alarms going off at once. He has been expertly shepherded by a more senior son of Somerset, Jos Buttler. Their partnership for the seventh wicket is an unbeaten 125, which is more than double the next best England stand in this match (57). Pakistan were on fire in mid-afternoon, but the evening belongs to England, who lead by 56 and live to fight another session, at least.

78th over: England 235-6 (Buttler 66, Bess 55) The final over of the day: Bess facing Amir, keeping him out, keeping him out – and then creaming a four through the covers off the very last ball. Ah, the audacity of youth.“Tim.” Yes, John Starbuck. “I don’t use any of those terms myself [75th over], so have no preference. There really ought to be a website for arcane cricket-related insults. Perhaps there is? My main gripe though is people thinking my surname ends in a S as well as starting with one.” Ouch – I plead guilty, but have done some hasty corrections now. “I’m not a coffee company (even though I’ve had a discount there now and again on the strength of it). I believe they picked the name because they’d read Moby-Dick, in which Mr Starbuck is the First Mate, whose gloomy predictions are never believed but all come true.” Classy.

6.26pm BST
18:26

77th over: England 231-6 (Buttler 66, Bess 51) Faheem produces a beauty out of nowhere, jagging away from Buttler’s bat, but it’s too good to find the edge. Robert Wilson, seeing Simon Horbury in full flow, is back for another bite of the cherry. “Yup, that is a top effort from Bess. Tyro blitheness and self-assurance are a nice little booster package but I’m guessing a debut fifty from a near school-age spinner in a sticky enough situation has to be founded on a base of strongmindedness. That’s Aussie level dogged. Respect.”

6.23pm BST
18:23

76th over: England 230-6 (Buttler 66, Bess 50) Mo Amir returns, which sounds like an attacking move – but Sarfraz gives him just the one slip, as if fretting about the deficit already (it’s 51). Buttler clips Amir for two. Bess may well steal the headlines, but Buttler has been terrific, calm and sober, adjusting to the red ball, while also grabbing every run on offer. “What do you think England need?” says Nasser, and the person he’s asking is Ian Botham, who knows a bit about improbable reversals. “200,” he says, firmly, as if he’s forgotten the time when 130 was enough.

75th over: England 228-6 (Buttler 64, Bess 50) So Bess passes the little test set by Mr Hussain, the deputy head, and then Buttler pulls Faheem for four. Nasser turns his beady eye on the fielders: “Pakistan starting to look a bit ragged, for the first time.” Simon Horbury is back, picking up on John Starbuck’s point from the 73rd over. “The Chinese Cut was our name for the Harrow Drive when I were a young ’un.

But point taken: Bess, who has sailed through a proper test of his temperament, now faces another, smaller one – can he play normally for the next few minutes?

73rd over: England 219-6 (Buttler 57, Bess 48) A few more singles off Shadab, including one taken off the last ball by Bess, who is no longer being shielded at all by his senior partner.“A Harrow drive?” says John Starbuck. “That sounds like a public-school educated denigration, just like the Chinaman used to be, along with the Staffordshire Cut and the ball going Irish.” It may well be – but let’s be fair to the public schools, they’ve produced many fine cricketers, including Buttler and Bess.Updated

72nd over: England 216-6 (Buttler 56, Bess 46) Abbas continues, and Bess picks up another single with a fluent flick to fine leg. He looks as if he could end up in the top six, just as long as he remembers to take some wickets. An email arrives from Adam Roberts. “These were Ed’s two out-of-left-field selections, so maybe .... Of course, with his one 1st-class wicket this season, we should have known Dom was being picked for his batting.“Am I alone,” he wonders, “in my super-immaturity, in saying ‘Yer face’ every time someone says ‘Shadab’?”

5.58pm BST
17:58

71st over: England 213-6 (Buttler 55, Bess 44) Shadab goes round the wicket and Buttler kicks him away. The partnership is 103, the lead 34.Simon Horbury. meanwhile, is on a roll. “Is it possible that England have adopted the idea that my, now very old, cricket masters occasionally had and have decided to reverse the batting order of the ‘best batsmen’? Might I suggest next time we do it genuinely and open with No 11?” Just don’t expect Jimmy Anderson to thank you.

5.54pm BST
17:54

70th over: England 212-6 (Buttler 55, Bess 43) Abbas returns, and Bess greets him with an imperious square drive, off the back foot. That could have been another off spinner: Carl Hooper. Buttler then plays a rare false shot – looks like a Harrow drive, turns out to be four leg byes – and that’s the hundred partnership. WinViz reckons England now have a chance of victory – a 2 per cent chance, that is. Mike Atherton and Wasim Akram both feel it’s a bit more than that.

17:49

69th over: England 201-6 (Buttler 53, Bess 38) Bess takes another of those tight singles. He needs to be getting through to the close, not committing hara kiri. There are about 40 minutes to go.Richard Morris is back. “I knew it would all be fine!”Meanwhile, in other news …Updated

17:45

68th over: England 199-6 (Buttler 52, Bess 37) Hasan bounces Bess and concedes a wide, which may have been a bit harsh. Pakistan, whose Plan A worked so well, seem unsure about Plan B. A few overs ago, Sarfraz raced up to the bowler’s end to remonstrate with Hasan, though, to his (Sarfraz’s) credit, he didn’t send him into the wilderness.

5.41pm BST

67th over: England 197-6 (Buttler 51, Bess 37) Sky show highlights of Butter’s fifty, and there have been plenty – elegant strokes, evenly divided between extra cover and midwicket. “He’s a game-changer,” says Wasim Akram. Takes one to know one.Updated

Well, this is a rare sight: an Englishman waving his bat in the air. Buttler clips Shadab to midwicket, where a dive doesn’t quite prevent the four. A lovely shot and a fine innings.

17:37

66th over: England 192-6 (Buttler 46, Bess 37) A few more singles off Hasan, and these two have put on 81, easily England’s best stand of the match. After an understandably stodgy start, they’ve been rolling along at four an over.Someone had to say it, and Simon Horbury has. “Make Bess captain... It would be no more ludicrous than having a match of 100 balls per innings, with the last over consisting of ten balls.”

17:32

65th over: England 189-6 (Buttler 44, Bess 36) Bess lives dangerously against Shadab, surviving an LBW shout as he misses the googly, and then prodding at thin air when the leg-break arrives. But he survives. Confident, plucky, resourceful, a fizzing fielder: there have been worse picks, and that’s just among the fringe spinners.Hugh Odling-Smee has a retort for Gary Naylor (64th over). “Well Michael was a better batsman than captain, so he would know.”

5.29pm BST
17:29

64th over: England 189-6 (Buttler 44, Bess 36) England startle the crowd by going into the lead, thanks to another punchy cover drive from Bess, who adds a cut for four and a swat for three as Hasan offers too much width. These two have sailed past the rocks of total ignominy, but real hope is still some way off.And here’s Gary Naylor. “Dom Bess is reminding me of Michael Atherton’s rather terse description of Chris Schofield – ‘He’s a better batsman than bowler’.”

5.23pm BST
17:23

63rd over: England 177-6 (Buttler 43, Bess 25) Shadab goes for a few comfy singles. The OBO’s loyal readers, like a few people in the crowd, may have nodded off.

5.21pm BST
17:21

62nd over: England 174-6 (Buttler 41, Bess 24) Buttler plays another of his measured pulls for a single. Don’t the umpires realise that having drinks in mid-over messes with our system?Updated
at 5.30pm BST


5.15pm BST
17:15

62nd over: England 173-6 (Buttler 40, Bess 24) Buttler picks up two thanks to another misfield, in the covers, and the deficit is down to six. It’s not the end of the over, but there’s a suspicion that the ball is being changed for going out of shape, and that’s drinks. England are now flirting with respectability, but it’s surely too little, too late.Updated

5.12pm BST
17:12

61st over: England 171-6 (Buttler 38, Bess 24) Shadab returns with his leg spin, and when he tries a rare googly, Bess eases it for four to third man. He is beginning to look like A Find.Here’s David Acaster, joining the captaincy debate. “I would make the left bail captain,” he says, “if I thought it would restore Root’s batting.” Well, I know what you mean, but he’s making just as many runs as he was in the ranks – just getting to 50 all the time and 100 less often.

5.08pm BST
17:08

60th over: England 166-6 (Buttler 37, Bess 20) Bess keeps out Mo Amir, in a way that his elders and betters could not, and then he plays the shot of his day, a delicious off drive, on the up, that brings a ripple of Lordly appreciation.

5.02pm BST
17:02

59th over: England 162-6 (Buttler 37, Bess 16) A single to each batsman off Faheem, and a lovely flick-hook from Buttler, which goes for four on the strength of a misfield from Abbas. That was old-school Pakistan. And so the 50 partnership comes up, a credit to both batsmen, and to Ed Smith – the first time his bolder picks have come good.“Buttler captain?” splutters Simon Horbury, a propos the 56th over. “1. You’re having a laugh. 2. Might happen sooner than later.”Updated
at 5.05pm BST


4.59pm BST
16:59

58th over: England 156-6 (Buttler 32, Bess 15) Buttler clips Amir for a single, fearlessly handing him four balls to have a go at Bess, who has his sensible head on and survives.Tom van der Gucht is back for more. “Drastic times like this call for drastic measures,” he declares, “and I’d like to think I’m from the Ed Smith school of decisive action. Having given it some consideration, after this test has been completed I’d drop Malan, select Morgan and give him the captaincy, swap Stoneman for Roy and tell Bayliss to focus on the white-ball cricket and ask Farbrace to step up and coach the test team for the foreseeable future.” At the risk of sticking my neck out, I can’t see all of that happening. But Tom is right that something needs to be done about Stoneman, who looked lost today, and has already been sacked as the short-leg fielder.

4.54pm BST
16:54

57th over: England 155-6 (Buttler 31, Bess 15) Bess wafts, for once, at Faheem, and gets a jammy four that might have been a catch to third slip. Sarfraz’s fault for going on the defensive when he’s right on top. That brings up the 150, and Bess’s first foray into double figures. He cashes in with a much better shot, a cover drive for four. The deficit is down to 24 now.

4.49pm BST
16:49

56th over: England 147-6 (Buttler 31, Bess 7) Amir comes round the wicket, looking for the killer reverse swing that Wasim Akram, who is commentating, brought to the 1992 World Cup final. And Buttler sees him off, happy to play out a maiden. Buttler has quietly manipulated the strike, facing 54 balls to Bess’s 33, without appearing to distrust him. Practice for the day when Buttler finds himself captaining England.

4.45pm BST
16:45

55th over: England 147-6 (Buttler 31, Bess 7) Buttler takes a rather tight single into the covers, but gets himself out of a hole with a sprint. He and Bess have done what ministers can only dream of, and halved the deficit. Aha, here comes Amir.Updated
at 4.51pm BST


4.41pm BST
16:41

54th over: England 146-6 (Buttler 30, Bess 7) Buttler picks up another two and a one off Abbas, and in between he may be dropped behind by Sarfraz, who is standing up – a very tough chance as Buttler nicked an inswinger. Buttler has earned that with his positivity, and his unflustered fluency.I was just wondering where John Starbuck was, when this turned up. “Those of us who have followed England cricket for a while are not masochists, simply resigned. We know things have to get really bad before they can get better, so it’s just part of a very long cycle. I well recall my emotional state at Headingley 1981, so I know that Hope springs eternal. She’s a deity to whom our emotions are sacrificed.” Nicely put.Updated
at 4.43pm BST


4.36pm BST
16:36

53rd over: England 143-6 (Buttler 27, Bess 7) Sarfraz makes a change, but it’s Faheem, not Amir, who returns. Buttler picks up a couple with a leg glance off Faheem, and a single with a glide to third man. The game is suddenly feeling sleepy, although if any team can wake themselves up with a start, it’s Pakistan. “Afternoon Tim.” Afternoon Simon McMahon. “If Buttler can cut loose here and make, say, 149, giving the England bowlers, say, 130 to bowl at, then you never know I suppose. Though you do, really.” Ha.“Speaking of Cambridge,” says Ben Reilly, “as somebody who has a ticket for tomorrow and is currently at the Cambridge beer festival, I really hope for it to be over soon so I can get properly drunk without worrying about the morning.” Priorities.

4.30pm BST
16:30

52nd over: England 140-6 (Buttler 24, Bess 7) Bess, getting a bit carried away, goes for a big cut off Abbas and misses, but recovers with a sensible push for a single. Buttler then gets a leading edge which pops up into empty space in the covers and brings him a streaky three.Here’s Tom van der Gucht. “I’ve been out for a pub lunch and spent some time sat in the sun, but I don’t think this game is over yet... If Buttler can tap into his IPL form and cream out a quickfire 150 backed up by Bess, Broad and Wood all cashing in with 30s against a tiring attack, we’d still be in with a sniff of a chance. Especially if Anderson could hang around for an obstinate 2-hour-long 12...” Well, that answers the question from the 44th over about dreamers or masochists.Updated
at 4.31pm BST


4.26pm BST
16:26

51st over: England 135-6 (Buttler 20, Bess 6) Dom Bess guides a two to backward point and moves to his highest Test score. Hasan responds with a feisty bouncer, which Bess does well to jag out of the way of, and a yorker, which he digs out. Well played the kid, as Jose Mourinho would say.Robert Wilson is back, answering my question from the 46th over. “Which university, you say? Put it like this; if you plough through the archives of Cambridge University’s august sporting records, you will find my name twice. Being the first soccer player to be sent off in their entire history is all very well but I think that getting sacked from the St Catharine’s Novices Rowing Eight for cheating on the dawn run to the river by taking a taxi was my finest moment.”Updated
at 6.42pm BST


4.22pm BST
16:22

50th over: England 133-6 (Buttler 20, Bess 4) A single to each batsman, off Abbas, and a clip for two from Buttler. There hasn’t been a wicket for a full eight overs. Sarfraz must be tempted to summon the extra snap of Amir.

4.18pm BST
16:18

49th over: England 129-6 (Buttler 17, Bess 3) Buttler is seeing the ball well and getting a big stride in to stymie the swing.“Certainly England are not awful,” says Ram Prasad, “but young guns from Pakistan have come good in this match and 4 half centuries have hurt England a lot. Just that the impetus to propel the score when the chips are down, is lacking from Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes. Particularly Jos as he is red hot from a terrific IPL stint. Could he prove me wrong today?” I’m not sure impetus is what’s lacking, especially from those two – they both have tremendous energy. What’s been missing is nous, from the moment Joe Root declined to bowl first on Thursday morning.

4.13pm BST
16:13

48th over: England 128-6 (Buttler 16, Bess 3) Bess finally comes to the party, albeit unintentionally, as, facing Abbas, he tries to withdraw the bat and gets a bottom edge to third man for three. They all count.“Desperate times, desperate measures,” says Jon Millard. “Can we still call up Chris Cowdrey?”

4.10pm BST
16:10

47th over: England 124-6 (Buttler 15, Bess 0) After a wary start, Buttler finds his groove with a front-foot pull off Hasan, and celebrates with two fours through the off side – a glide and a cover drive. Given something to cheer at last, the crowd go wild, or as wild as they go at Lord’s.Here’s Dave Seare, with an email that’s more of a one-act play. “The phone rings at Lord’s.‘Er, hello.’‘Good morning, I’d like to speak to [insert England player name] please.’‘I’m sorry Sir, he’s just gone out to bat.’‘That’s ok, I’ll wait...’Tip your waiter, we’re here all week.”Updated

4.05pm BST
16:05

46th over: England 112-6 (Buttler 3, Bess 0) We have a run! Buttler hooks, or swats, Abbas for a controlled single to fine leg. Bess, again, keeps the straight ones out. He looks like finishing his first Test without any wickets, but he has shown a good temperament.“Dear Tim,” says Robert Wilson. “I’d hate to be guilty of reflexive Celtic Fringe anti-Englishness. I love you guys. You fed, clothed, housed and educated this particular Irish urchin. Then you sent me to your best university. Thanks a bunch. That was incredibly nice of you. And has confirmed my decided Anglophilia. So it is with great pain and deep sympathy that I point out that we are quite clearly MUCH better than you at Test cricket.” Nice one. So which university?Updated

However grim things get, we can always rely on Gary Naylor. “Writing a quiz recently,” he begins, classically, “I recalled that Zaheer Abbas made 240 at The Oval in 1974 (I was allocated locker 240 when I went to the big school soon after). In 44 years watching cricket, this feels as low an ebb as at any time since. 4-0, 58 all out, The 100 and now this.” It seems we’ve reached peak Naylor.

3.59pm BST
15:59

So what do you reckon – have England been awful, or just not as good as Pakistan? Sarfraz and his young team have given the sort of performance that Jurgen Klopp is planning for this evening: an underdog masterclass. OK, they’re not up against Real Madrid. But England are strong at home, and normally formidable in May – they’ve never lost a Test that has started this early in the summer. Send us an email (and if you sent one a bit earlier, please send again to tim.delisle at gmail, as my Guardian email is down) or a tweet.

3.45pm BST
15:45

45th over: England 111-6 (Buttler 2, Bess 0) Another maiden, from Hasan Ali to Dom Bess, who manages to play a solid straight bat to some naggingly accurate deliveries. And that’s tea. A moment that usually brings balm to an English brow, but here it’s more a case of rampant embarrassment. After England had finally had a good hour, Pakistan bounced back with a sensational one, taking four wickets for 19 in no time. England are minus 68 for 6, and the only doubt is whether Jos Buttler can bash a few defiant fours and make Pakistan bat again. Updated

3.39pm BST
15:39

44th over: England 111-6 (Buttler 2, Bess 0) A maiden from Mohammed Abbas to Jos Buttler, who was standing outside his crease to reduce the risk of LBW – so Sarfraz Ahmed came up to the stumps, adding sheer courage to his collection of strengths as a keeper-captain.“Why the doom & gloom?” said Richard Morris, a few minutes ago. “Root will bat safely for hours, Buttler will survive comedy moment after comedy moment, we’ll have a lead of 150, 8 for from Sir James, Ed Smith will look like a genius, all is right in the world.” Are cricket fans dreamers, masochists, or both?

3.33pm BST
15:33

43rd over: England 111-6 (Buttler 2, Bess 0) Well, this is a rout. And if it weren’t for Simon Burnton, you wouldn’t have heard about it because I’ve been having almost as many technical problems as England’s batsmen. Big thanks to Simon, and many commiserations to Ed Smith on finding, like a few others before him, that he has taken over a shaky ship.Updated

3.29pm BST
15:29

42nd over: England 110-6 (Buttler 1, Bess 0) Root has now got 10 half-centuries since his last ton. That was a fine delivery from Abbas, and given that he is the only Englishman to even offer some token resistance here it seems unfair to be overly critical, but that’s not so good. Anyway, here, finally, is Tim. Bye again!

Pakistan think so, the umpire thinks so, and Root has to review it in the circumstances.

3.23pm BST
15:23

41st over: England 110-5 (Root 68, Buttler 1) Hasan Ali is back. Root, whose innings has so far been exemplary, drives through the covers for four. A single gives Buttler half the over to deal with, and he is so committed to being unButtlerish that he leaves the ball whenever he can, even when he very nearly can’t - the last goes two inches wide of off stump, too close for comfort.Alerts:England have lost by an innings only three times at Lord's; last was v SA in 2003.Pakistan have won by an innings only once in England - Leeds, 1987.Pakistan marching towards a historic win.#EngvPak

3.18pm BST
15:18

40th over: England 105-5 (Root 63, Buttler 1) Pakistan know that Buttler will do as Buttler does, so move three slips into position as Mohammad Amir takes aim. A maiden is the almost inevitable result. But the slips very nearly got some action, Amir’s final delivery a peach that tempts Buttler into a drive and zips just past the edge.

3.13pm BST
15:13

39th over: England 105-5 (Root 63, Buttler 1) That is a ludicrous way to get out in this situation. That dismissal was so soft it was practically liquid. It was a gaseous dismissal. A damp fart of a dismissal. The question now is whether England can make Pakistan bat again.

Summer came late in 1906, and the spring, harried by a keen north-east wind, hardly stopped at all. May was cold and grey, frosty till the third Sunday. It was dismal weather for cricket. The season started on Wednesday the 2nd, but no one came to watch. Lord’s was empty. The Oval was empty. Old Trafford was empty. The press began to fret. On 27 May the Observer published a leader called The Necessity for Cricket Reform. It asked if the game had outlived its popularity. “Matches are being finished, but the crowds do not come,” the editorial read. “Cricket seems to have grown too old fashioned for these go-ahead times.”The Observer wasn’t the only one worrying. The next year’s Wisden recalled “all sorts of gloomy forebodings”. Until “the sun came out and all was well”. By the far side of the summer, England was in the middle of a long, late heatwave. George Hirst did the double-double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets, but Yorkshire were still pipped by Kent, who won 11 championship matches in a row, thanks in part to their brilliant young all-rounder Frank Woolley. It was one of the great seasons of the Golden Age, and when it was over, “no more was heard as to cricket being on the wane”.All this is just another reminder that cricket has always had a morbid obsession with its own death. As if this thanatophobia is a natural consequence of following the game, the inevitable upshot of a sport that leaves you so much time to stew, is so closely yoked to the coming and going of summer, and so dependent on the vagaries of the weather. The anxiety gets to be infectious. I suffer from it myself. It comes on stronger with age, perhaps because we never care for the sport so much as we did when we first came to it, so, looking back, it always seems less to us now than it did then.Even in 1906, the administrators and journalists were fussing and fretting over it, rethinking it and tinkering with the regulations to try to make it more appealing. In 1900 the MCC changed the length of an over, in 1904 there was a proposal to launch a new knockout competition for the counties, in 1905 they considered scrapping the toss, and in 1906 WG Grace argued the championship should be split into two divisions. There were running debates right through the decade about how many Test matches should be played, and how long they should last.Cricket’s been going on so long that there’s nothing new left under the sunWhich are all ideas we’re still turning over now, a century later. In the these last few weeks, the International Cricket Council has said that it is considering whether or not to scrap the toss in the new Test championship, there has been a push from within English cricket to get rid of the County Championship’s two divisions and replace them with regional conferences, and the England and Wales Cricket Board has, of course, announced it wants to change the length of an over so it can launch a new domestic competition. South Africa have already played a four-day Test. Cricket has been going on so long that there’s nothing new left under the sun.This lingering suspicion that the game is an anachronism is not entirely unique to cricket. It runs through its cousin game of baseball, too. The writer Susan Jacoby has just published a book about it, Why Baseball Matters. Just like cricket, baseball is worried that it’s losing the young audience; it has the oldest, whitest crowd of any major US sport. Nearly six out of 10 fans for nationally televised baseball games are white men over 55. Compare that with YouGov’s sketch of the English cricket fan, who, compared to similar groups, is particularly likely to be a rightwing male, over 55, and well-to-do.The MLB commissioner, Rob Manfred, tells Jacoby he is convinced that the “three-hour-plus length of the average baseball game” is “a major problem for young fans”. Jacoby believes that “the aging of baseball’s audience is largely attributable to the profound dissonance between a culture saturated with devices that offer instant gratification and a sport that requires intense, sustained concentration”. Baseball’s problem, she argues, is that “it derives much of its enduring appeal from a style of play and adherence to tradition very much at odds with our current culture”. It is, as the Observer put it in 1906, “too old-fashioned for these go-ahead times”.Last week the ICC held a seminar in Dubai to talk over its global strategy. It presented a “Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats” analysis. It was a provocative document, designed as a starting point for the discussion. It listed the “time it takes to complete the game” as one of the weaknesses, flagged up T10 cricket as both a threat and an opportunity. It even went as far as to ask “Why does cricket exist – what’s its primary purpose in society?” Which sounds less like a threat, and more like an existential crisis.Maybe cricket’s restless fretting about its own status is one of the game’s great strengths, a quality that has caused it to adapt and evolve, the reason we’re still playing and watching it all these years later. Certainly it seems to have been the backdrop to every other English summer since the sport started. We worry away at it until the sun comes out again. They say it will be shining when the first Test starts at Lord’s on Thursday. The crowds will be out, the international season under way, and all of a sudden, for those precious few hours, everything will seem right with the game.• This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

Anderson The first game we played against each other was Lancashire v Leicestershire at Old Trafford in 2005. I remember Gibbo [Ottis Gibson] was playing for you guys, but I don’t think we actually spoke to each other.Broad No, we definitely didn’t speak to each other because you’re not exactly the most socially friendly bloke with people you don’t know! I can then remember an England preparation camp for the 2006-07 Ashes in Loughborough. You were going on that tour but I was just up there as part of the academy and a few of us got involved in the training camp. But you didn’t speak to anyone you didn’t already know.Anderson I was just shy. Although Cooky always reminds me that the first words I ever uttered to him were a send-off in an Essex game!Broad In our very first game as team-mates we hit the winning runs together. I don’t think we’ve ever done it since.Anderson We are very rarely out there batting together when games finish. Even in drawn games, Broady is nowhere to be seen. You’re a bit of a cowboy, aren’t youBroad Longest nought in the history of English Test cricket, old boy!Anderson Not really, because we weren’t really like-for-like. We are different types of bowlers.Broad I would come in for Harmy to begin with and Jimmy would come in for Hoggy, and then when we got our chance together in New Zealand [in their first Test together in 2008], Ryan Sidebottom was the main opening bowler so we had different roles to play.Anderson We’d toured Sri Lanka together in 2007 and both carried the drinks a fair bit, which was good for us because we spent a lot of time together and got to know each other doing 12th-man duties. Swanny was there with us doing the same, so that’s where the friendship grew from. Some people say having competitiveness between team-mates is healthy but I’ve never really found it to be healthy. For example, the Gough/Caddick relationship in the dressing room was absolutely horrible to experience. It might have driven them on but from a team’s point of view it was awful.Broad We’ve never had that edge to want to outdo each other. We’ve had occasions where we’ve actually tried to get the other one a wicket if they’re on four, or nine for the match.Anderson We played Sri Lanka last year and I was on nine for the match. They were nine down and Broady came off mid-spell and said: “Come on, you get this last one.”Broad Our parents are quite close actually.Anderson We went for a coffee this afternoon and bumped into Stu’s mum and stepdad and got chatting. At the end his mum says: “I’ll tell your mum and dad I’ve seen you and you’re doing well.” It’s quite nice that they’ve been through this whole journey with us for more than 10 years and they’ve got a relationship too.Broad That’s one of the good things about cricket, the friendships around the game. My parents are still good friends with Straussy’s parents.Anderson The best I’ve seen from him was in the 2009 Ashes at The Oval – cleaned them up good and proper. Seriously good balls to seriously good players. It was under pressure, an important moment. That was a terrific spell.Broad Jimmy at Trent Bridge in 2013 was incredible – not just the fact it was a long spell, but a genuine match-winning performance. To get 10-for on a pitch that no one else got much out of was so skilful. I’m not sure I’ve ever felt as on-edge as I was that last day and he pops up with that final wicket. And I can remember my favourite moment on the field to his bowling was in the 2015 Ashes when I was stood at short mid-on and he nicked off Adam Voges. Mitch Marsh came in and went for a big drive. I was next to Chris Rogers, the non-striker, and as Marsh played the shot I could hear Rogers go: “Ahhh no!” There’s a picture of that somewhere.Anderson Talking of pictures, I remember another great spell from him and then taking the catch in Durham in 2013 to win the Ashes, and you’ve got Broady in the foreground and me throwing the ball up. These are the moments you live for.Broad Marcus Trescothick. No question. I hate bowling to him. I pitch it up, he drives me through the covers. I bowl back of a length, he runs me down to third-man. I go short, and he lifts me over the keeper or pulls me for four. People say go full with an in-swinger early to him, he just hits me for four. He’s the one I’ve never found a way past.Anderson You should run it across him from straight. I struggle with batsmen who have a lot of time and make you feel slower than you are, so Kumar Sangakkara was a big one. I’ve got him early once or twice but if you don’t he’s getting 180. Hashim Amla is similar.Broad AB de Villiers, Ross Taylor, Michael Clarke.Anderson I look back to my early days and think: “I would love to bowl at Graeme Smith with the skills I’ve got now.” Or Ricky Ponting. In 2010 I had some success, but before that I hated it – I was scared of bowling at him. I’d love to bowl at Hayden, Gilchrist and people like that now, because it might be a bit more of an even contest.Broad Believe in your mental approach more. Mark Bawden [England’s team psychologist] helped me at the end of 2010 when I decided I needed to make a change emotionally. I threw the ball at the Pakistan keeper [Zulqarnain Haider], I was getting into a bit of trouble and getting a reputation. Mark set up a whole “warrior mode” mentality for me so when I get angry I look out of the ground. If I could have done that when I was 20 instead of 25 I would have developed much quicker as a cricketer. But then you need to make mistakes to learn.Anderson I’ve not heard you say that before and I was exactly the same with Bawds. Before I met him I got angry and then would try to bowl as fast as I could and leak more runs. It was pointless. Since I’ve controlled that, I’ve got a lot better. I would also tell a 20-year-old me to trust myself more. Even if you’re in the England team, just because a coach says something it’s not gospel. Filter the stuff that works for you and trust your own mind.Anderson We’ve got to start producing the goods more often. We’ve been so inconsistent over the winter and it has cost us. We’re more comfortable at home, which helps, but we have to be on our A-game for Pakistan and then for India. It won’t be easy.Broad We can’t be complacent at all and we won’t be.Read the full interview in the new issue of Wisden Cricket Monthly and pick up the next three issues for just £5 with offer code 3FOR5X6 at Wisdensubs."

It is a brave move to stage a World Cup in a country where the chairman of the board believes “the younger generation” and the “Asian community” are not attracted to your sport, and braver still to make those two audiences such a key part of your marketing strategy. Which is what the International Cricket Council has done for this tournament.The ICC invited dozens of kids and dozens of Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani fans to play street cricket at its World Cup launch in Brick Lane on Wednesday. It was a good party. Full of people laughing, playing, eating and drinking. Colin Graves did not attend.Dave Richardson, the ICC chief executive, did his best to be diplomatic about recent comments by Graves, the England and Wales Cricket Board’s chairman. “Well‚ that is very much an English viewpoint,” he said. “Globally we are seeing that the average age of our fans is lower than even football and certainly rugby.”As for whether or not he felt the sport needs a new 100-ball format, Richardson said: “From an international point of view, probably we would say no.” He added some caveats about how it was important to give the competition a chance, then added: “But certainly there isn’t an appetite to create another format.”Richardson said: “Our strategy is clear, in that we’ve got three formats of the same game, and it is challenging in itself to keep them from cannibalising each other. But what it does do is provide us with an opportunity to provide an offering to everybody, every type of cricket fan.”In England, Richardson said, “there is a bit of a challenge making sure we re-engage with the youth and grow the game from a participation point of view”.The 2019 World Cup is the best opportunity English cricket has to do that. Steve Elworthy, the tournament managing director, said that “55% of people who came to the Champions Trophy hadn’t been to cricket in the last five years or so – and there was a huge Asian support base for it – we want to build on that”.Brick Lane is only five miles from Lord’s but in another sense it is half a world away. And here, in the heart of London’s Bangladeshi community, there was a real sense of cricket as a modern, multicultural sport, a vibrant game loved and played by people from all parts.The ICC has even commissioned Caleb Femi to write a poem for the tournament, which includes the line: “Fly your flag with pride, after all it’s Britain, everyone’s welcome.”Femi’s poem is splashed in brilliant colours across the top two storeys of a fabric store just down Brick Lane. The ICC was worried that the owner would refuse but he is a cricket nut and said he would be delighted to oblige.Elworthy said: “We have stated ambitions to engage with a million kids between now and the end of the tournament. We have 100,000 tickets earmarked for under-16s, we have an opportunity to drive huge participation.”The ICC is doing its part. It is planning “inner‑city takeovers” from “Durham to Taunton, fan zones, live screenings for the semi-finals and finals”. It may work, it may not. But the enthusiasm, fresh thinking, is more likely to make a positive difference than the ECB chairman is, so long as he keeps droning on about how no one likes or understands the sport any more.The ICC’s Anti-Corruption Unit will meet al-Jazeera journalists in the next 48 hours to examine its evidence that players from England and Australia had committed spot-fixing in Test cricket. Both England and Australia have denied the claims.Dave Richardson, the ICC chief executive, said it would be “very surprising” if international cricketers were involved in fixing but he promised the ACU would investigate fully all the same.“I’m a little perturbed by any accusation that we would attempt to sweep it under the carpet or pretend that nothing has happened,” he said.Richardson is confident that the International Cricket Council has “got the mitigating measures in place” to make sure fixing does not happen in international cricket, but he admitted there was a growing problem with corruption in domestic Twenty20 competitions. Al-Jazeera’s documentary also exposed an alleged plot to launch a corrupt T20 league in Dubai. The knock-on effect of the tighter security at the international level is that the fixers “are now trying to create their own leagues, at a much lower level, and the danger is they will start going to domestic tournaments”.He said: “Those leagues do provide an additional opportunity for the people that want to get involved and try and fix. We’ve got to take much sterner action in the future.”The ICC will bring in regulations to ensure domestic tournaments held outside full member nations take place only if the organisers work closely with the ACU in doing due diligence on team owners, and on developing an anti‑corruption code and a player education programme."

Jos Buttler has earned his Test recall on the back of his “unique gifts” as a destructive batsman. This was the view from Ed Smith when he named his first squad as England’s national selector and handed an opportunity to the uncapped off-spinner Dom Bess.While the 20-year-old Bess comes in on the back of the broken thumb suffered by his Somerset colleague, Jack Leach, on Monday, it was the decision to bring in Buttler as a specialist No 7 batsman that hogged much of the attention out of the 12 picked for the first of a two-match series against Pakistan at Lord’s on 24 May.The 27-year-old certainly represents a wildcard pick where talent trumps County Championship form, with the last of his 16 caps coming in India 18 months ago, no first-class cricket since last year and the first part of the season spent thrashing five successive half-centuries for Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League.“The panel felt it was the ideal time to reintroduce Jos,” said Smith. “We felt that a player of his unique gifts – what he brings as a destructive batsman, as a competitive presence, as a dynamic athlete, as someone who has leadership skills and is playing with such confidence and flair – this was the right time. The decision has been made eyes wide open.”The starting point for Buttler’s inclusion was actually the promotion of Jonny Bairstow to No 5. While the Yorkshireman retains the gloves ahead of England’s one-day wicketkeeper – Smith cited his ability to perform both roles – it is hoped this will bolster the batting as the captain, Joe Root, returns to No 3 and James Vince misses out.While Mark Stoneman is afforded another chance as Alastair Cook’s opening partner, Vince’s demotion after 13 caps and an average of 24.9 comes despite a match-saving unbeaten 201 for Hampshire against Somerset compiled over eight and a half hours.Joe Root (Yorkshire, capt), Jimmy Anderson (Lancashire), Jonny Bairstow (Yorkshire, wkt), Dom Bess (Somerset), Stuart Broad (Nottinghamshire), Jos Buttler (Lancashire), Alastair Cook (Essex), Dawid Malan (Middlesex), Ben Stokes (Durham), Mark Stoneman (Surrey), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire), Mark Wood (Durham).Smith said: “When you see [Vince] bat well, boy does he look a Test player. However, there’s a bigger picture and this is what I said to him today: his cricketing history throughout his Tests and also levels below, he has not produced the runs he should have done. He has not defined enough matches in a way that a top-order batsman with his ability should.”On Root’s return to No 3 he added: “If you’d asked me, I’d have said I’d love Joe to want to bat there. Independently of that, Joe has said that’s what he wants to do – and I think it’s an excellent move. Joe wants what is best for the team.”The former Test Match Special commentator and Kent batsman went on to state that the door is not closed for Vince or Moeen Ali, who was dropped for the final Test of a harrowing winter both for England and personally, and has been at the IPL since.Instead Bess gets the spinner’s berth, having claimed 63 wickets at 22 apiece in his 16 games to date, albeit with only one of those games coming this season. Smith praised this excellent start to his career, the impression he made when with the England Lions and MCC during the winter and his sparky character.Commenting on the news of his first Test call-up, Bess said: “I was actually in Ikea with my girlfriend. I’ve just got a new house so we were looking for some sofas and I was having an argument with my missus.“I was really gutted for Leachy. He’s worked so hard. Luckily I’m very good mates with him and we work very well together at Somerset.”The England and Wales Cricket Board has called a meeting with officials at Surrey in a bid to address any ongoing issues with the new 100-ball competition.Colin Graves, the ECB chairman, appeared to threaten the club with the removal of the Oval’s host status during an interview with the Daily Telegraph on Monday in response to perceived sniping about the controversial new format’s rather hapless launch.Richard Gould, the Surrey chief executive, described some of the public reaction to the tournament as “mirthful” over the weekend, prompting Graves to say: “If they don’t want it, fine. But if they do want it, they have to be 100% committed.”Surrey insist they remain determined to make The Hundred a success but, much like the Professional Cricketers’ Association, they are also keen to get more detail and see their questions addressed when they meet with the ECB in the first week of June."

In the youngster Ollie Pope Surrey have a batsman to watch. The 20-year-old scored his third hundred in 10 first-class matches to turn day one against Yorkshire on its head following a sticky start on an unusually green-tinged pitch.At 69 for four and 162 for six either side of lunch Surrey were struggling after Joe Root’s decision to let the toss go uncontested and bowl first - Root is captaining Yorkshire this weekend following illness to Gary Ballance. A score of 200 was in doubt against a team full of confidence having beaten champions Essex last weekend despite posting 50 in the first innings. But Pope, a calm head on young shoulders, guided Surrey to 366 for seven.Having come in at six, the diminutive former England under-19s right-hander battled hard with his fifth-wicket partner, Dean Elgar, (61) to share 68 before Rikki Clarke dominated a key 129-run stand for the seventh wicket either side of tea, taking the score to 291 for seven.It was only once the belligerent Clarke, who passed 10,000 first-class runs, departed for 71 to Jack Brooks with the second new ball that Pope (131) kicked on, showing the flamboyance which has also made him useful against the white ball. Maybe he will take to 100-ball cricket? That is, of course, as long as it goes ahead. Speaking at tea on BBC Rradio, Surrey’s chief executive, Richard Gould, admitted there is plenty of confusion surrounding the ECB’s plans for the new competition. Asked whether he thought it would go ahead in 2020, he said: “I don’t know.”Earlier Mark Stoneman was lbw to Tim Bresnan for 10, Rory Burns was caught at first slip off Brooks - his 400th first-class victim - for nine and Ben Foakes caught behind off Steve Patterson for 18.The Division One leaders, Nottinghamshire, were bowled out for 133 by Lancashire at Trent Bridge, including two wickets for Jimmy Anderson, before the visitors responded with 157 for four. Haseeb Hameed posted a duck.The champions, Essex, having suffered their first Championship defeat in 19 against Yorkshire, are struggling again, away to Worcestershire. They were b owled out for 177 – Alastair Cook hit 37 – before the hosts responded with 47 for no loss. At Taunton rain meant only 58.1 overs were possible between Hampshire and Somerset, with the visitors 198 for eight. James Vince hit a flighty 44 and Tom Abell took three wickets.In Division Two Eoin Morgan’s 76 for Middlesex (356 for six) against Gloucestershire at Lord’s represented his first Championship fifty since September 2014. Dawid Malan matched him.Fourteen wickets fell on a helter-skelter opening day between the leaders, Warwickshire, and Northamptonshire at Edgbaston. The teenage seamer Henry Brookes was shaping to be the headline act for Warwickshire with four wickets, including three in an opening spell that had the visitors 52 for six and 118 for seven by lunch. But Steven Crook (92) and Doug Bracewell (81) changed the complexion as a stand of 122 pushed them up to 256. They also shared three wickets in Warwickshire’s reply of 100 for four. Ian Bell is 55 unbeaten."

It is often claimed that cricket has the richest literature of any sport. Possibly an exaggeration – baseball also has strong claims – but undeniably it is rich. And almost certainly I am not the only cricket-minded person who, getting older, derives as much pleasure from reading about the game as actually watching it. Why so rich? Because it takes place (in its longer form, anyway) over days, not hours; because its fundamental simplicity (bowl – hit – run – field) masks considerable tactical and even strategic subtlety; because of its traditional white-on-green aesthetic appeal; because of its often hugely telling social history (gender and ethnicity as well as class); because it is a game so much played in the mind; because of its almost unfailing ability to reveal character; and for many other reasons. What unites the writers here is that, deep down, they all know the two essential things: that cricket really matters; and that cricket really doesn’t matter at all.1. Days in the Sun by Neville CardusModern cricket writing begins with Cardus, the working-class Mancunian autodidact who in the 1920s found fame reporting cricket matches for the Manchester Guardian. It was he, more than anyone before or, arguably, since, who exploited the possibilities of imaginatively turning the leading cricketers of the day into three-dimensional, almost novelistic characters. He also appreciated how the rhythm and feel of a day’s play depends as much on the interaction between players and crowd as it does on the events in the middle. Cardus’s reputation has waned in recent years (too many factual inaccuracies, note the pedants), but he remains the foundation stone.2. Australia 55 by Alan RossCricket tours in the old days were leisurely affairs, starting with the long voyage out, and this account of the epic Ashes-winning tour under the determined if sometimes overly pessimistic captaincy of Len Hutton stands as a classic of the tour-book genre. In his day job a renowned literary editor and accomplished poet, Ross here provides a seductive double narrative: the cricketing dramas and heroics, yes, but also a shrewd, lyrical snapshot of a country still finding its modern identity.3. Beyond a Boundary by CLR James”What do they know of cricket who only cricket know?” famously asks the West Indian writer and political activist. Regularly placed at or near the top of lists of “best cricket books ever”, this is a compelling mixture of memoir, history, polemic and technical analysis, all knitted together with a sense of deep personal engagement. Cricket’s natural escapist appeal often keeps its literature firmly within the boundary ropes; but even more than Ross – and writing on the cusp of the postcolonial moment – James is exhilaratingly different.4. The Art of Captaincy by Mike BrearleyCricket’s philosopher-king – and arguably England’s most successful captain – explains all … In the process, his lucid treatise not only guides the reader through the many tricks, traps and pitfalls of being a captain, but reveals just how complex, psychologically as much as tactically, the game is. Ian Botham once described him as having “a degree in people”, and with characteristic sensitivity Brearley explores how playing cricket can produce at least as many lows as highs – a fact that far from every captain, whether on village green or Test arena, understands.5. Concerning Cricket by John ArlottArlott was a published poet before, in the postwar years, turning himself into a top-flight cricket writer and legendary, Hampshire-burred radio commentator. This collection of relatively early essays, inspired in part by William Hazlitt (one of his heroes), ranges from a near-rhapsodic evocation of two days of county cricket at Bath to a close socioeconomic analysis of the conditions of the professional cricketer. Altogether it is Arlott at his humane, penetrating best.6. Beyond Bat and Ball by David FootBased in the West Country, and a fount of gentle wisdom, Foot is one of the Guardian’s most cherishable cricket writers. His forte, exemplified here, is getting behind the facade and sympathetically revealing difficult, even tormented lives, with most of his subjects martyrs, to a greater or lesser extent, to a game that can exact a heavy toll. The 11 profiles end with Tom Richardson: Surrey and England’s great paceman of the 1890s, a cricketer of unrivalled heart and pluck, he found it hard (as so many professional sportsmen do) to handle retirement, dying in France in 1912 in dark, uncertain circumstances.7. The Cricket War by Gideon HaighOne event above all stands out in cricket’s last half-century: Kerry Packer’s boldly entrepreneurial coup in 1977 that split the cricket world and directly led to the game’s capture by television, along with such innovations as floodlights, white balls and coloured clothing. Almost everything since – including the recent controversial “100 Balls” announcement by the English authorities – has flowed from that bitterly contested demarche. Haigh, leading cricket historian and writer of broad sympathies, delivers the definitive account. This is not cricket literature as therapy, but sometimes harsh reality is unavoidable.8. One More Run by Stephen ChalkeSurprisingly few cricket books have focused on a single match, but this gem is one of them. Largely through the memories of “Bomber” Wells, off-spinner and raconteur, Chalke lovingly recreates the three-day encounter at Cheltenham in 1957 between Gloucestershire and Yorkshire. The contest itself reads compellingly enough, but what is left in the reader’s mind is the microcosm of a now long-gone ecology: players and spectators imbued alike with strongly local affinities; respectful appreciation of craftsmanlike qualities; and the whole occasion a world away from the coarse and mercenary biff-bang of T20, or worse.9. A Corner of a Foreign Field by Ramachandra GuhaIndia was for so long one of the Cinderellas of world cricket: Don Bradman never went there, nor did many leading English players. That has now utterly changed, as the IPL formula (exuberant crowds, huge TV audiences, mega-bucks, brash and noisy spectacle, sixes all the way) continues to exercise a bewitching influence. In his groundbreaking, elegantly written history of Indian cricket, Guha gives us the long-run narrative, going back to the days of the British empire; and in so doing he, befitting Gandhi’s finest biographer, illuminates the making of modern India itself.10. Cricket: The Game of Life by Scyld BerryThe most recent of the 10 books, this would have been recognised as a modern classic if more rigorously edited. But it is still a wonderfully enjoyable and insightful potpourri as it strides confidently across cricket’s epochs and geographies. Writers who genuinely and fearlessly think for themselves are rarer than one might think, but Berry is one of them, never more so than in his chapter on “Numbers”, unpicking cricket’s obsession with statistics – that obsession which over the years has drawn so many to the game. People may let one down, but batting averages never do."

Pace. It felt the final frontier for England on their ill-fated voyage to Australia during the winter but, as Ed Smith plots a new course as national selector, a bowler who had to teach himself to walk again 18 months ago might offer one possible solution down the line.Olly Stone is a right-armer capable of speeds in the mid-90s and has a claim to be the fastest in the country right now. On the first day of Warwickshire’s match against his old club, Northamptonshire, on Friday he offered the latest glimpse of his potential with two wickets, including a snorter with his first ball to remove Adam Rossington caught behind.Henry Brookes, the 18-year-old from Solihull, was the standout on show with four scalps and is certainly a name to keep an eye on for the future. But Stone may enter England’s thoughts sooner if he can get fit and firing over the coming weeks. If so it would chiefly be for his attributes, given a cricketing CV that has been stop-start to date.This was only his second outing of the summer following a hamstring strain and, in between some venomous deliveries, there was understandable rustiness as he took two for 57 in 10 overs. His first game, against Sussex in the opening round of matches, was when tongues began wagging as he claimed eight victims via speed through the air rather than nibble off an April surface.“I’m trying not to look too much into all the talk,” said the likeable 24-year-old from Norfolk. “I didn’t even know there was a new selector for about a week. I’m not very clued up! Change opens up opportunities, I suppose, but right now I’m just happy to be playing for Warwickshire again.”This mind-set is understandable. Back in July 2016, when still with Northants, he suffered a horrific injury when innocuously jumping to celebrate the wicket of Moeen Ali in a Twenty20 Blast fixture. The anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee snapped but, with the adrenaline pumping and little pain, he bowled the final ball of his over, which then tore the cartilage to boot.“I thought that might be it and I’d be down the pub deciding what to do next,” said Stone. He was out of contract at the end of the season as well yet, despite uncertainty over his future, 12 clubs got in contact about his services. Warwickshire won out, with access to rehab facilities at Aston Villa a big draw for a player who signed the deal while still on crutches.“I had to learn to walk again without limping. I had two operations and Andy Williams, the surgeon, was amazing. And I was lucky to go to Aston Villa to use their underwater treadmills which helped massively. Warwickshire were so great too. They put no pressure on me coming back last year.”Stone did indeed return, fleetingly, with his most eye-catching performance coming on T20 Finals Day when, in the semi-final against Glamorgan, he was clocked at 94mph and picked up three wickets, only for a bruised heel to see his season end after defeat in the final.From there it was decided that a winter playing grade cricket in Australia at Bayswater-Morley in Perth would be more beneficial than joining the England Lions. But as well as getting through his time unscathed, he was also invited to join the senior squad before the third Test for two days of bowling in the Waca nets.“It was my first time away from home and playing cricket for three months with no setbacks was huge,” he says. “I learned a lot too, especially with the Kookaburra ball. Jim Troughton, my Warwickshire coach, contacted Paul Farbrace [England’s assistant coach] and I had two days in the nets bowling to the likes of Alastair Cook. I tried to let the handbrake off and I didn’t feel I let myself down.”Already known to the national team’s coaches, wickets in the second innings of this ongoing Division Two match could accelerate the England chat further, although his employers in Birmingham are very keen that expectations are managed.“I have always wanted to bowl quick and it might have been my downfall at times, be it training or celebrating a wicket,” said Stone. “I just greet each wicket with a fist-pump now, rather than jumping in the air. But unless my body tells me to slow down, I don’t think I ever will.”"

North Richmond Street, being blind, is a quiet street. There is nothing there to tell you what went on at No 17, the red-brick terrace house where James Joyce lived as a kid. Round the back there is a courtyard garden, where Joyce spent happy hours batting against his brother John. “I remember having to bowl for him for perhaps an hour at a time,” John wrote. “I did so out of pure goodness of heart since, for my part, I loathed the silly, tedious, inconclusive game.” James was a “useful bat” and “eagerly studied the feats of Ranji and Fry, Trumper and Spofforth”. Years later he threaded the four of them into the text of Finnegans Wake.It was the week for old stories about Irish cricketers. There is another about Samuel Beckett, half-true, about how, when he lived in Ussy-sur-Marne, he would drive the neighbour’s boy to school in his convertible. The kid was so big he could not fit in the bus seats. When he grew up they called him André the Giant. “I asked André what he and the famous author talked about when they were together,” wrote Cary Elwes. “‘Mostly cricket,’ André recalled.” Beckett opened the batting and bowling for Trinity College. He had a first-class batting average of 8.75 and, like Joyce, he never lost his taste for it.It is funny to think these great men had the same daydreams as the rest of us. Joyce and Beckett are two famous members of the small band of Irish Test match fans. In the 20th century this was a fruitless pursuit. For the past 140 years the only way an Irishman would play Test cricket was if he got picked for England. Leland Hone was the first to do it, in 1879. Hone, who kept wicket in the third-ever Test, was the first of seven Irishmen to play Tests for England. But there were many more, boys and men, who would have played for Ireland if they had had the chance.Men like Tom Ross, who took nine for 28 against South Africa, and Dougie Goodwin, who took five for six against West Indies in that famous game at Sion Mills in 1969. Men like Scott Huey, who topped Wisden’s first-class averages in 1954. In those days a bowler needed to take 10 wickets to qualify for Wisden’s list. Huey played only one first-class game all summer, against MCC, but he took 14 for 97. Men like Jimmy Boucher, who took 168 wickets in first-class cricket, at 14 each, seven of them for 13 runs against New Zealand.The inaugural Irish Test XI took to the field for the first time at Malahide last Saturday, at least a hundred years later than they might have done. “Tomorrow 11 of us will represent the 688 who have gone before us,” wrote Andy Balbirnie. “Thank you for paving the way for us to fulfil our dreams.”Malahide came as a sweet relief for an Englishman, upwind from Colin Graves’ Ratner-esque blather and the ECB’s steaming pile of “fresh tactical dimensions”. Graves, 70, was at it again on Monday, pontificating on the BBC about what the “younger generation” want. There was never a better reason to switch over to Guerilla Cricket, where it was broadcasting Kevin O’Brien’s fine innings, the first Test hundred for Ireland. It almost set up an improbable victory but in the end Ireland lost by five wickets. Which means Australia are still the only team to win their first Test.Except even in Ireland, where Test cricket was only just born, there was a whiff of something terminal about it. Over the weekend Brendon McCullum, the former New Zealand captain who did as much for the format as any other modern player, said in an interview: “I firmly believe Test cricket won’t be around in time, because there’s only so many teams that can afford to play it.”Ireland are not one of them. One could hear it in the words of their captain, William Porterfield, and chief executive, Warren Deutrom. “For most countries,” the latter said, “Test cricket, apart from England-Australia, which is the obvious exception, is a loss-leader.”Ireland are due to play only 16 Tests in the next five years. “It is going to be very hard to organise three- or five-game series with the cost that is involved. It would be great if we could play quite a few Tests a year but it is not financially viable as it stands,” Porterfield added. “That is what it is.”For all our romantic blarney about what Test cricket means to the Irish, Porterfield’s blunt truth is that the chance to play the game is just a bonus that came along with full membership of the ICC, which Ireland were finally granted last year. Full membership allows their administrators to plan not just for six to 12 months but three years down the line, to know what fixtures they are going to get and what funding they are going to get.“So that is probably the biggest thing it brings from Cricket Ireland’s point of view,” Porterfield said, “and Test cricket comes along with that and we are fortunate enough to get that opportunity. But, to be honest, T20 probably has taken over.”One could see that in the scaffolding grandstands. Cricket Ireland had set up only 6,000 seats and it did not fill them. When Ireland play two T20s against India this summer, the capacity will be increased to 8,000. Outside England and Australia Test cricket is a heritage business. The Irish may as well have discovered a sudden enthusiasm for steam trains."

Keaton Jennings will step back into what he calls the “ruthless environment” of international cricket after being recalled to the England team for the second Test against Pakistan starting on Friday, at the expense of his close friend Mark Stoneman. England’s response to the nine-wicket defeat at Lord’s is a role reversal from last summer when Stoneman was parachuted in as an opener and Jennings made way, having struggled at home against South Africa after his 112 on debut against India the previous winter.Jennings, 25, has since made the switch from Durham to Lancashire and started the summer brightly with his new side, registering two Division One centuries, against Somerset and Nottinghamshire, and then another against the latter in the One-Day Cup.“I was surprised to get the call but I’m really, really happy,” Jennings told the Guardian, shortly after news of his return was confirmed on Monday. “Test cricket is a ruthless environment, with extreme highs and lows. You do a lot of soul searching but to move to Lancashire, be made to feel welcome and have an impact has been special.“There have been technical things I have worked on, like better rhythm with my hands and transferring my weight, but one of the biggest things is confidence. Last summer was tough. Every fault was massively highlighted. But hopefully it will be a bit different this time.”Jennings is the first among the procession of Alastair Cook’s opening partners in recent times to get a second crack at the role without filling in for an injured player but, going on the performance of Pakistan’s bowlers in the first Test, he faces a stern examination of this renewed confidence and technique at Headingley.Mohammad Abbas, who claimed eight wickets at Lord’s for the man of the match award, will offer a similar challenge to that of Jennings’s nemesis, Vernon Philander, last year, bowling from tight on the stumps and offering a bat’s width of movement by standing the seam up to attention.If Jennings was surprised at the recall, then so too, perhaps, was Trevor Bayliss. Just before the head coach sat down with Joe Root and the national selector, Ed Smith, after the Lord’s defeat, he went on record playing down the chance of a switch given the tight turnaround between Tests.Though he gave a nod to two openers “getting close” – Nick Gubbins of Middlesex the other – the message was that batsmen need to make their case beyond doubt, “not just averaging 40 and being the best of the rest”. Jennings has made 314 at 44.58 this season.But Stoneman may have needed removing from the firing line. He went to Lord’s bereft of form with Surrey and returned scores of four and nine. Though his second-innings dismissal came when the leg-spinner Shadab Khan got one to shoot through at shin height from out of the foot holes, there was little sense of permanence before.The 30-year-old showed courage under fire during the Ashes, not least when peppered in the first innings at Perth, but was vulnerable after averaging 27 from 11 Tests – with none of his five half-centuries going north of 60 – and struggling a touch in the field.Jennings, who previously played with Stoneman at Durham, said: “I am still close mates with Rock and I feel for him. I have been where he is right now and it’s a pretty low point. But regardless of what happens, we are human beings and will remain close friends.”England’s second visitors this summer, Australia, have suffered a setback to their already thin squad with Josh Hazlewood’s withdrawal from June’s five-match one-day series with a back problem before the team’s departure.The 27-year-old joins Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins, his fellow Ashes‑winning seamers, on the injured list, while Steve Smith and David Warner are, of course, suspended for their role in the ball-tampering scandal that erupted in South Africa in March.The tour is Australia’s first outing since, with Tim Paine leading the side and Justin Langer having taken over as head coach. Michael Neser, the uncapped South African-born allrounder who plays for Queensland, has earned the call following Hazlewood’s withdrawal.AN Cook, KK Jennings, JE Root (capt), DJ Malan, JM Bairstow (wkt), BA Stokes, JC Buttler, DM Bess, MA Wood, SCJ Broad, JM Anderson, CR Woakes."

The tally of missed chances mounted up for England on the second day at Lord’s but a slightly prickly Jonny Bairstow was adamant after stumps that the five to go to ground during Pakistan’s first innings reply is not for a lack of effort in training.Joe Root’s side need a hugely improved second showing with the bat to retain any hope of winning this two-Test series. But, with Babar Azam retired hurt, there remains one wicket still to claim with the tourists set to begin day three on 350 for eight and leading by 166 runs.As well as Pakistan have played, England have contributed hugely to their current predicament by following the disappointing 184 all out on the opening day – having won the toss – with a somewhat sloppy collective effort in the field.Alastair Cook in particular will not look back on Friday fondly, having put down two chances at first slip and seen another fly between himself and the wicketkeeper; the CricViz stats show that only 69% of those that come his way in the past three years have been held.Asked for theories as to why the hosts have not been sharper, Bairstow said: “It’s not from practice. You will have seen how much we have done. If you can put your finger on it, you are welcome to join us in practice. It happens doesn’t it? It’s part and parcel of cricket. You can look into it as much as you wish or make up whatever ideas you want.”Regarding the match situation, Bairstow said: “They’ve played well but we are going into the weekend with potentially best time to bat on this wicket. By no means are we out of this. We have people in the lineup more than capable of achieving parity with their first innings, or even going past it, and then potentially it’s the worst time to bat in that final innings.”Pakistan’s bright start to the series has suffered one significant setback, however, with Babar retiring hurt after being struck on the wrist during a hostile mid-afternoon spell from Ben Stokes. The No 5 underwent a scan that showed a fracture and he is now set to miss the second and final Test in Leeds next week.Azhar Ali, who made one of four half-centuries for the tourists, said: “Obviously we are in a good position now but there is a long way to go. A Test match win never comes easy. Every batsman fought hard. The conditions weren’t easy against a good quality England attack. These two days are from good preparation. Hopefully we can transfer that into a win.”"

After years of waiting, nothing came. Ireland’s first day of Test cricket, against Pakistan, was a washout. It passed without even so much as a coin toss to watch. The players skulked around in the pavilion, the groundstaff scurried around the outfield, the crowd huddled in the bars, and the Super Soppers turned lazy circles around the covers.It was a fine introduction to the Beckettian pleasure of wet Test cricket. Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes. Samuel Beckett was a cricketer himself, of course, the only Nobel literature laureate with a first-class batting average. It was just the kind of day for chatter about matters like that.The Cricket Ireland chief executive, Warren Deutrom, was determined not to get too gloomy about it all, which must have been a challenge for him given that he has been working towards this ever since he joined the board in 2006.Deutrom describes Test cricket as a “loss leader” for Cricket Ireland, and since it could not afford full insurance, the refunds for the 5,100 tickets sold will cost it another €75,000.“Yes, of course it’s disappointing,” he said, “but what I don’t want to do is go around with a long face, projecting misery. Because it isn’t that. We’re still hugely proud and there are still four days to go.”The forecast is better over the weekend. There was a hint of the warmer weather ahead when the sun actually came out for the first time all day, 20 minutes after they abandoned play."

Eight people have been killed and dozens more wounded by multiple explosions at a cricket match in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, officials said. The blasts occurred after evening prayers on Friday at a football stadium that was hosting a cricket match at the start of the holy month of Ramadan, Sohrab Qaderi, a member of the provincial council, said. Cricket, which was introduced to Afghanistan by migrants and refugees who learned the game in neighbouring Pakistan, has become an increasingly popular sport, particularly in the east of the country.A statement from the United Nations assistance mission in Afghanistan said there had been four explosions, two inside the stadium and two outside, apparently timed to hit those fleeing the initial blast. Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the provincial governor of Nangarhar, said eight spectators were killed and 43 wounded by at least three back-to-back explosions. “I am outraged by this attack that used four bombs carefully calculated to kill and maim civilians watching a cricket match,” said Tadamichi Yamamoto, the top UN official in Afghanistan. “This cold and brutal act can have no justification whatsoever; those responsible must be held accountable.” There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the Taliban issued a statement denying its involvement. Nangarhar, on the border with Pakistan, has seen growing violence this year, most recently last week when a coordinated attack on the state accounts office killed at least 15 people in an attack claimed by Islamic State. Last week, the provincial governor was dismissed over deteriorating security in the province, which has become a stronghold for Islamic State fighters as well as the Taliban. Friday’s attack came as the Taliban has stepped up its campaign against the government in Kabul, with attacks on district and provincial centres in regions ranging from Badakhshan and Baghlan in the north to Farah in the west and Ghazni south of Kabul. The attacks have undermined confidence in the government as it continues preparations for parliamentary elections due in October. "

Chris Stocks at Headlingley

Wed 30 May 2018 18.12 BST

Jimmy Anderson has offered a bullish defence of England’s Test side, insisting there is “no problem” despite a run of seven defeats in 10 matches, but that confidence was deflated somewhat late on Wednesday night with the news Ben Stokes is an injury doubt with a hamstring problem.The all-rounder has a tight left hamstring and will be assessed on Thursday before a decision is made on whether he needs a scan. Sam Curran has been drafted into the squad for Friday’s second Test as cover in what is the 19-year-old Surrey all-rounder’s first Test call-up.Before the Stokes news, however, Anderson had sent out a defiant message to the critics. Speaking after the nine‑wicket hammering by Pakistan at Lord’s, the former captain Michael Vaughan urged England to “shake things up” by dropping either Anderson or Broad for the second and final Test of the series at Headingley.Joe Root’s team know that only victory – and avoiding a series defeat – in Leeds will lift the mood of despondency that remains following a miserable Test winter in Australia and New Zealand. But Anderson, England’s all-time leading wicket-taker, said: “I don’t think there is a problem. I just think we’re potentially low on confidence. It needs something just to turn it round, a bit of luck or something.“I think it’s quite easy for the confidence of the team to take a hit when you have a defeat like that. So it’s going to take some special individual performances this week. So we’ll try, as well as using our skill, to use our heart – to use the fight we have in the dressing room to show people what we can do.”As for Vaughan and the ruffling of metaphorical feathers? “When you suffer a heavy defeat there’s always a lot of noise,” Anderson said. “Lots more opinions come out. There’s not a lot as players we can do about that. If the management or players think that feathers need to be ruffled, then as players all we can do is concentrate on our job.“The outside noise is always there and it’s a bit louder when you perform badly. That’s something you’ve just got to deal with as a sportsman and block out as best you can.”There’s no surprise that Anderson disagrees with Vaughan’s view that his new-ball partnership with Broad should be broken up when the series finale starts on Friday.“Obviously I’m going to say no,” he said. “We’ve 950 Test wickets between us. We’re doing the best we can for this team. We’re trying to perform well enough to turn this team around. I know we’ve been on a really bad run of form this winter and the first Test here and I think in these situations you need players to stand up and put in match-winning performances.”There was also short shrift for those who accused him of not bowling a full enough length in the first Test.Anderson, whose four wickets at Lord’s took his career tally in Tests to 535, said: “Some people think they might know better than me but I’d like to think that, after 15 years of playing Test cricket, I know which lengths to bowl on certain pitches.“It’s not as simple as saying ‘we’ve got to bowl fuller’ and just chucking it up there and get smashed everywhere. There’s a bit more to Test cricket than that. You’ve got to be patient. I’ve always looked at it as almost a game of chess.”Trevor Bayliss, England’s coach, has admitted he was at a loss as to why some of the messages he gives to the players do not get through. The Australian, whose future in charge of the Test side is now under scrutiny, had said in the immediate aftermath of Lord’s: “It’s enough to make you throw your hands up sometimes.”Anderson responded: “I’m not sure what he means. As I said, we’re talking a lot, trying to figure out what’s going wrong. Trevor can’t come out there with us and tell us how to bowl. It’s up to us to take that responsibility.”Keaton Jennings revealed that his recall this week caused him to miss an exam for the accountancy degree he is studying online. The 25-year-old opener was dropped last summer after playing six Tests.“I was meant to be writing an exam this afternoon,” Jennings said. “A lot of things happen in life that pull you different ways and I think Test cricket is one of those special moments you’ve just got to enjoy. It might be the last Test I play, so I really want to enjoy it.”For Pakistan the prize of a first Test series win in England since 1996 is tantalisingly close and the fast bowler Mohammad Amir said: “If we win the series I think it will be the best memory of my life.”Eoin Morgan (Middlesex), Moeen Ali (Worcestershire), Jonathan Bairstow (Yorkshire), Sam Billings (Kent), Alex Hales (Nottinghamshire), Liam Plunkett (Yorkshire), Adil Rashid (Yorkshire), Joe Root (Yorkshire), Jason Roy (Surrey), Ben Stokes (Durham), David Willey (Yorkshire), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire), Mark Wood (Durham) Jos Buttler to replace sam Billings for Australia seriesAlastair Cook has offered a less positive appraisal of where England are now in Test cricket, with the opener saying careers are on the line in Leeds this week. “We need to play better,” he said in his column for Sky Sports. “Test futures are on the line.“If you want to play cricket for England, you’ve got to deliver, otherwise we’ll be looking for other employment. That’s the nature of the beast and, fundamentally, we’re not producing out in the middle.“But we have to stick together as a group. The last thing you can do is play the blame game, and the trick now is for us to not carry the negatives from the first Test at Lord’s with us to Headingley.”"
cricket,"Why disrupt the season just as the County Championship had started to take shape and build some momentum?By Gary Naylor for the 99.94 Cricket Blog

I review theatre elsewhere and, inevitably, the worlds of cricket and stage occasionally overlap. To succeed, both need to engage their audiences with performers displaying technical excellence in welcoming venues, provide exciting peaks of dramatic tension or bake slow-burn thrillers to perfection, and tell us something about the world we live in – and ourselves. So far, so good for cricket and theatre, but which playwright would spend five acts constructing a complex, multifaceted narrative, only to abandon it in favour of another starting from scratch (and, soon, yet another)? It’s not just no other sport that does such a thing with the warp and weft of its unfolding plot, it’s no other business with a public to please.While one Lancashire (well, perhaps “Lancashire” might be more accurate) wicketkeeper prepares to play as a specialist batsman for England, another played as a specialist batsman for his county. Alex Davies fits more recognisably into the tradition of glovemen with bat in hand than Jos Buttler. The local lad is short and slight of stature, with something of a right-handed Jack Russell about his batting, squirting the ball into odd places, moving around the crease on quick feet to slash and pull with a horizontal bat. Having made Lancashire’s second highest individual score in their List A history (and that history includes some very famous names indeed), might Davies develop the kind of game that would most closely replace Eoin Morgan, like-for-like, in England’s 50-overs team when the captain calls it a day?Somerset hammered Surrey at The Oval – surely that was a bad day at the office for Rory Burns’ men, rather than a true indication of form for the 2015, 2016 and 2017 finalists – then backed up the win with another two points at home. The form batsman in the country was barely needed on a well-attended Surrey Schools Day riddled with schoolboy errors (pace Richie). Two days later, James Hildreth biffed a career-best 159 (with 13 fours and eight sixes) as Somerset cruised home beating Glamorgan by 83 runs. In the era of the international franchise circuses, guns for hire and inter-county loans, one-club men such as Hildreth are an endangered species. Perhaps they’ll be even more treasured as a result.What has happened to Steven Finn? In four matches so far this month, he has just the one wicket – this from a man whose strike rate in Tests was once up there with the greats? Unlike five of his Middlesex team-mates, he went wicketless as Kent fell 70 runs and six overs short of their target at Radlett. Finn would have enjoyed the win as captain of his team, but he must wonder where he’s going as a cricketer – it’s a real shame for a talented and likeable man, his career blighted by injuries, losses of form and a seemingly fragile confidence.Was that really Mason Crane on television bowling like Yasir Shah? The gawky kid who earned lots of praise but few wickets in his one Test in Australia appeared to have transformed himself into a man, looking older in the face and stronger in the body after recuperating from a stress fracture in the back. He bowled with a man-about-town’s swagger too, the ball that drifted into Ben Foakes to draw him forward and slightly over-balancing to leg, before ripping past the outside edge for a regulation stumping, was a thing of extreme beauty. The Hampshire man may prove to be another Danny Briggs, but his spell of 3-45 suggests his game is built on stronger foundations than his Hampshire and England predecessor.It was a surprise to discover that Warwickshire’s Sam Hain is not yet 23. He seems to have been around for years – and, with well over 100 matches under his belt, he has – a once youthful record-breaker, whose championship form followed a similar trajectory to that of his (relegated) county in 2017. The white ball must be a little easier for Hain to sight, as its appearance has provoked two centuries in two matches, the latter undefeated in a successful chase at Headingley. The Aussie-raised batsman is entering a crucial couple of years for his England ambitions, as he is no longer the brightest and youngest batsman looking to catch the selectors’ eye, but a summer debut in 50-overs cricket, playing against an old Australia Under-19 team-mate in Ashton Agar, might be just what’s required to move to the next level.• This article appeared first on The 99.94 Cricket Blog• Follow Gary Naylor on Twitter"

On a grey day at Lord’s the situation grew grimmer for the home side. The pattern of the game was sustained as Pakistan outplayed England by dint of solid, unspectacular, old-fashioned virtues. This is not how Pakistan are supposed to prevail. In the past the inspired, stream of consciousness cricket of Waqar and Wasim, Mushtaq and Qadir, and Anwar and Inzamam has enthralled and intimidated, depending on your vantage point .But here for two sessions the Pakistan team was clinical and patient, dutifully grinding down an England side which contains three players who in recent times have been accustomed to spending only 20 overs in the field at any one time. Then in the final session they played a few more shots against a weary attack.England had to work hard to remove all the batsmen except Sarfraz Ahmed, whose top-edged hook would have provoked stern words in the dressing room were he not the captain. Four batsmen exceeded 50, one of whom, Babar Azam, had to retire hurt having been hit on his left forearm by a short ball from Ben Stokes, who produced the most hostile bowling of the day. That spell aside, when Stokes bowled nine consecutive overs interrupted by the tea interval, the England bowlers were no more than persistent, while their out-cricket was far from flawless; four chances of varying difficulty were spilt.In cloudy conditions, where the ball obstinately refused to swing as much as it did for Pakistan on Thursday, the batsmen were prepared to wait for their chance of runs in the knowledge the ball can speed away from the square at Lord’s like putts from the wrong side of the green at Augusta. Pakistan were prepared to play the long game and they did so with great resolution and a little luck since there was always sufficient movement for the ball to pass the outside edge. On similar days in the past Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson have run through sub-continental teams here.Run-scoring seemed easiest at the start. In the first half hour when Anderson over-pitched in vain pursuit of swing Haris Sohail drove him for two fours in an over and it was not until the introduction of Mark Wood that a wicket fell. Maybe anticipating another bouncer Sohail was stuck on the crease and edged to the keeper. Anderson looked more dangerous – especially against the right-handers – when he switched to the Nursery End. He found a suggestion of away swing and dispatched Azhar Ali lbw for a valuable 50.England could not capitalise after lunch despite bowling Anderson and Broad in tandem. On 10 Babar offered a tricky catch off Anderson, low down and to Alastair Cook’s right at first slip. A poor review against Asad Shafiq for lbw when Wood was bowling hinted at England’s frustration. So much for home advantage. In archetypal English conditions it was Pakistan who were taking control. An edged upper cut by Shafiq and he became the second half-centurion in Pakistan’s innings.Until now Stokes had been sparingly used. Root had allowed Dom Bess his first prolonged spell in Test cricket and he bowled competently enough; but he discovered neither a hint of turn nor any batsman who might be in the least alarmed by some conventional finger-spin. A small error in length and the batsmen patted the ball away into the gaps.Stokes inconvenienced them a great deal more in the fieriest spell of the innings, during which he occasionally exceeded 90mph. On 59 Shafiq cut in the air and Jos Buttler in the gully took off to his left, parrying the ball towards Dawid Malan at second slip but it did not reach him, a technical chance but not an expensive miss. Stokes steamed in again and this time Shafiq could only parry a short, fast delivery, this time in a gentle parabola straight to Malan.Just before tea Stokes set his field for bouncers, which were duly delivered and the mercurial Sarfraz soon obliged with a top-edged hook, whose descent kept Wood at fine leg waiting for a disconcertingly long time. But the catch was taken.After the interval Stokes continued, taking the new ball rather than Anderson. Now Babar, who had batted purposefully throughout, failed to pick up another short delivery, which thudded into his left forearm. After a long delay in which the physio surveyed the damage, applied an ice pack and – who knows? – asked the name of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Babar left the field, with tests later confirming he had suffered a fractured wrist.England may have sensed the door was ajar but now two young all-rounders, calmly and with some silky strokeplay, closed it. England’s out-cricket became ever more fallible. Shadab Khan and Faheem Ashraf had already added 50 together when two more chances went begging. In consecutive overs Faheem, on 29, edged between Jonny Bairstow and Cook off the exasperated Wood. Then Cook dropped the day’s most straightforward chance, a regulation slip catch given by Shadab on 30 off Anderson. This pair had added a sparky 72 together when Anderson could smile, though certainly not beam in exultation, at another Test wicket, having bowled Faheem off the inside edge.Shadab flailed once too often at Stokes after making a sparky 52 but at the close Pakistan were 166 ahead, which should be more than enough."

Sri Lanka Cricket has pledged to cooperate fully with anti-corruption officers as the sport awaits the broadcast of an investigation by al‑Jazeera that is understood to allege details of a plan to fix England’s first Test match in Galle this November.Some footage from the documentary Cricket’s Match-Fixers, which will be televised on Sunday, has already been made public, which allegedly reveals the groundsman at Galle telling an undercover reporter he can tailor the pitch to produce a specified outcome for betting purposes. This is understood to have been alleged to have taken place before two previous Test matches in Galle, too: Sri Lanka versus India in July last year, where the tourists amassed 600 in their first innings on a pitch made to be a batting paradise, and against Australia in August 2016, when the visitors lost in two and a half days on a deliberately turning track.The International Cricket Council has already opened an investigation but also made public some frustration that the information shared by al‑Jazeera to date has been limited despite “repeated requests” for full disclosure before the programme is televised.A statement from Sri Lanka Cricket said: “SLC will extend its fullest cooperation to the ICC to investigate the latest allegations levelled via media reports over ‘match fixing’. SLC wishes to state that it has zero tolerance towards corruption and will take immediate action against any person involved in the alleged incident, if found guilty.”In the programme Robin Morris, a former Indian cricketer, is filmed telling reporters he can arrange bespoke pitches for betting purposes – his payment would be 30% of any winnings – while the stadium’s assistant manager and groundsman, Tharanga Indika, is recorded stating that he can ensure the Sri Lanka versus England Test match does not end in a draw.Morris has since denied any wrongdoing and claimed he thought he was auditioning for an acting role in a movie “for public entertainment only”, while Indika has said he was simply being courteous to foreign tourists and is similarly not corrupt.England’s winter tour to the island, in which they will play three Tests, five-one-day internationals and a one-off Twenty20, has already drawn the ire of the Barmy Army. The supporters’ group and travel company have accused Sri Lanka Cricket of “blatant profiteering and short-sighted greed” over proposed ticket prices for the Test series.The company’s latest information is that while local fans will be able to buy tickets on the grass banks for £1.41 a day those travelling are to be charged just under £50 a day for seats provided they book for the entire match, with no refund policy should it finish early.The Barmy Army website states: “This blatant profiteering and short-sighted greed does nothing to enhance Sri Lanka as a cricketing destination and ultimately we feel it is likely to do damage to the country’s reputation as a reasonably priced general tourist destination.”"

Dom Bess is on the verge of becoming the youngest finger spinner to make his Test debut for England but there appear to be few nerves leading up to this particular slice of history.The Somerset academy product is only 16 first-class matches into his career and, should he win a first cap against Pakistan on Thursday, he will do so at 81 days younger than Derek Underwood when his bow came against West Indies at Trent Bridge in 1966 aged 21 years and 22 days.Does he feel ready? “Of course I do!” came the quickfire reply from a smiling Bess before his second day of training with Joe Root’s Test side, as he leaned back in his chair in the press conference room at Lord’s with an arm draped over the backrest. The right-armer, who has shot to prominence at Taunton with 63 wickets at 22 apiece, looked very much at home in these surroundings despite it being only his second time in NW8, the first having come as a 12th man last year with Somerset.“I enjoyed the lunches,” replied Bess when probed about this past experience. “Me and Roelof van der Merwe were tucking in. I put on a bit [of weight] those few days. It was my first time properly up in London so I was a bit of a tourist as well. I’ve never been to the home dressing room, so to have a look at the honours board this week was very special. I hope one day I can get my name up there.”And what will he be thinking at the top of his mark, should he get the nod? “Wickets! I am an attacking off-spinner. I get very competitive, which is a trait of mine, but it depends on the role and the situation. But you are always looking for wickets, aren’t you?”For all Bess’s confidence who also issued a plea for Ikea to get in touch with after his call-up interrupted a spot of sofa shopping with his girlfriend last week, there was an acknowledgment that this chance has come via the misfortune of a county colleague, even if he believes “everything happens for a reason”. Jack Leach was due to resume his place after making his debut during the New Zealand tour but a broken thumb has put a second cap on hold. Bess has sought his close friend’s advice on what to expect, as well as that of Craig Overton following his own debut during the Ashes.Bess said: “Jack absolutely loved it and I saw when he came back – him and Craig Overton – that when you get a taste of it, you want it even more. And as soon as I’ve been here now, I want it. I want it more and more. I think that’s a very good trait to have. We are at Lord’s, hopefully going to make my debut. You’ve just got to enjoy it, haven’t you?”While England look to the future with Bess, Pakistan were happy to discuss their recent past with their head coach, Mickey Arthur, talking up the qualities of Mohammad Amir and discussing a plan to replicate the impact of another left-armer in Trent Boult. The New Zealander’s career-best six for 32 in Auckland rolled Root’s tourists for a paltry 58 two months ago and Amir, seemingly fit again as he manages a chronic knee problem that flared up against Ireland, is looking to adopt a similar approach to his fellow southpaw.Arthur said: “I think Mohammad Amir is the finest exponent of pace and swing when he gets it 100% right. We’ve used that spell that Boult bowled in Auckland and the lengths he bowled. We believe Amir bowls incredibly well at left-handers and there will be three [Alastair Cook, Mark Stoneman and Dawid Malan] in their top four.”"

The unnamed England and Australia cricketers alleged to have been involved in spot-fixing by al-Jazeera’s undercover investigation into corruption are set to be interviewed when the International Cricket Council’s own probe gets under way.ICC officials are due to meet with the Qatar-based broadcaster this week following a request for all unedited materials sourced during the making of Cricket’s Match Fixers, the documentary that was aired on Sunday, to be shared with them.Among the claims aired was the allegation that three England players batted to order during the fifth Test against India in Chennai, December 2016, having agreed to score below a set number of runs during a 10-over passage of play as part of a betting scam.The England and Wales Cricket Board has issued a strong denial of any wrongdoing by its players, stating there is “no credible evidence”, as did Cricket Australia following a similar allegation made about two of their batsmen when they played the third Test against India in Ranchi last year.While all five players’ names were redacted in the final edit, along with specific match details that would assist in identifying them, the ICC will seek to get this information from the upcoming meeting with al-Jazeera and then look to speak to those allegedly involved.Speaking before his side’s departure for a limited‑overs tour of England in June, the Australia captain, Tim Paine, said: “At this stage it’s unsubstantiated claims. We’re confident that none of our guys are involved in it. As far as I’m concerned our players have got nothing to worry about. I’m really confident none of our players are involved.”The allegation of English involvement comes at an already troubling time for the Test team given the disappointing nine-wicket defeat to Pakistan at Lord’s on Sunday that has seen them now go eight matches without a win.Trevor Bayliss, the England head coach, has however insisted the allegations were not responsible for their poor showing. He said: “There was no chat about it in the change-room. It would be wrong to blame that for the way we played. When we were told about it, the thought on it was that it was rubbish.”"

And I know there are mixed feeling about All Stars cricket below the line but this (below) must be good news. Anecdotally, I feel sure I’ve seen a few more kids in the park with cricket bats than I have done in previous years.

Gower on Vince as the teams shake hands with Hampshire 434 for 2 declared, and Vince 201 not out, an innings to remember however kind the pitch today.

Gloucester are into the lead against Middlesex - ten runs into the lead, in fact: they’ve just lost Jack Taylor for 41, but in brighter news young James Bracey has reached his century. They’re 256 for 4 at Lord’s.

Vic MarksHampshire are now 361-4 on this chameleon of a pitch with Vince unbeaten on 167 after 7 hours and 42 minutes at the crease. Eddie Byrom has just bowled three overs of loopy leg breaks alongside Dom Bess. So handshakes are likely at 16.50 on a day of disappointment for Somerset, the greatest of which is the injury to Leach. They love him down here. “We don’t want to lose you but we think you ought to go” was the mentality before he broke his thumb. Now it will probably be about six weeks before he plays again. Someone might have stolen his Test spot by then.No matter that the pitch has been sedated by the sun Vince has played a superb innings to save the match for his side. We wait to see whether he will be around the county circuit for much longer this summer.

Must solemnly report that James Vince has now reached 167, Hampshire onto 316 for 4, 87 in the lead over Somerset.

Here’s a report from Graham Hardcastle to keep you ticking over, in which Joe Root speaks:When you come back to Yorkshire, you want to perform and give a bit back to the side. It’s been a little bit disappointing,” said Root, who led Yorkshire at the Oval owing to Gary Ballance’s illness. “But that’s cricket, it can be challenging. I didn’t come into these games to get ready for the Test matches. I made sure I did my preparation beforehand to try and perform well for Yorkshire. It’s just not materialised, unfortunately. That’s just how it can go.”

3.24pm BST
15:24

A 50 for Kevin O’Brien! That, as you will no doubt not need reminding, is Ireland’s first Test half-century. Hats off to the larger of the O’Brien brothers. And perhaps more tangibly important, they’re now in the lead, albeit only by 11 runs but they’ve at least avoided an innings defeat after being made to follow on. 191 for 6 at the moment. 

3.15pm BST

Vic Marks“James Vince has moved on to 130 with great serenity, Rossouw has 22 and Hampshire now lead by 35. There is no spin for Bess; Overton is trying some off-cutters and the game seems to be drifting towards a draw. This is objective analysis; I don’t really believe in jinxing. In any case in my experience games of cricket only undergo technicolour transformations after I’ve written the match report.”

2.41pm BST
14:41

Vince moves to 130 off 330 balls, which brings a strange pattern to an innings that must mean something. But what? Lessons learnt? Fortitude at the last? Too little too late? Whichever, Ed Smith isn’t a man to leave his homework to the last moment - he had picked the team before today - hadn’t he?

2.32pm BST
14:32

Another 21 year old, Matt Critchley, demi-slaying the Durham attack at Derby. Five fours so far in his 34 not out. Derby 167 for 4, lead by 74. Not enough yet, but might a last-session run-chase be on the cards?Updated

Vic Marks“Jack Leach has a broken left thumb, which means that he will not be available to resume his Test career against Pakistan in the forthcoming two Test series. Before the start of play at Taunton in Somerset’s match against Hampshire Leach was batting in the nets against Jason Kerr, the first team coach, and his dog ball thrower. The ball rose unexpectedly and struck his thumb; Leach immediately headed for the pavilion. The worst fears of Leach and his Somerset colleagues were later confirmed.This is a cruel blow for Leach, who impressed in his debut Test in Christchurch at the beginning of April and it comes on the eve of the announcement of England’s squad for the Lord’s Test. With Liam Dawson currently unfit there is not another left-arm spinner on the horizon. The selectors will no doubt reconsider Moeen Ali, who is currently in India, as well as two extremely raw off-spinners, Leach’s colleague at Somerset, Dom Bess, and Surrey’s Amar Virdi.”

Hampshire trail Somerset by 15 runs.Division 2Middlesex b Gloucestershire: Middlesex 455-8 dec, Gloucestershire 210 and 149 for 2 (Roderick not out 48, Bracey 42 not out) Gloucestershire trail Middlesex by 96 runs.Derbyshire v Durham: Derbyshire 427 and 114 for 4 (Wood 3-29), Durham 520. Derbyshire lead Durham by 21 runs. A collapse by Yorkshire gave Surrey victory in the first session of the day. Surrey’s young team rise to second in the table, with a game in hand over Notts. Vince is playing beautifully, patiently, and with most fortunate timing at Taunton, to stay Somerset’s hopes of a third consecutive win at home. A fascinating session on the card there after lunch. As Vic reported, Jack Leach is currently off the field with a dog-ball-thrower related thumb injury. At Lord’s, Gloucestershire have not lost a wicket this morning to frustrate Middlesex; and Mark Wood has made important inroads into Derbyshire’s batting.

Vic Marks“Vince has reached his hundred, one of his best. Perhaps the most telling statistic is the number of balls faced, 277. The pitch has been at its best for batting yesterday and today but there has been no flightiness from Vince. I’m informed that this has been the slowest hundred in the Championship this season, so the slowest and one of the best - that must confuse them at ECB towers - where are the sixes to keep the women and children entranced?“Anyway Somerset then disposed of Tom Alsop fairly quickly, caught at second slip off Tim Groenewald for 12. So there is still life in this game. Still no sightings of Leach and no updates either. At lunch Hampshire are 260-4, 15 behind. Just before the break Rilee Rossouw edged his first runs and then fell to the ground; he summoned the physio so there was a six minute delay, followed by a bit of time wasting, which prompted two of the wiliest, old umpires (Lloyds and Evans) to race into position at 12.59.”Updated

Amla caught behind off Gregory for 107, flapping at a wide long-hop, or surprised by a quicker off-side bouncer, depending upon your disposition. If Smith was here he would be presumably be dismayed by Leach’s absence, lukewarm about Craig Overton’s bowling (tho pleased to see that his brother is fit enough to be the sub fieldsman), and mightily impressed by Vince who has played one of his most disciplined innings (unless he has already decided to drop him).”

Before the start Jack Leach, potential matchwinner here today, potential Test player next week, was in the nets, practising his batting. Jason Kerr, the first team coach was hurling balls with the dog ball thrower. Leach was struck on the left hand, clearly in considerable pain and promptly departed to the pavilion.

Hello! Welcome to the final day of this round of Championship games - the last for a while. Of course the sun is out, the elderflower nearly in bloom and the season off to a flyer. Four games remain in play today:Surrey v Yorkshire: Surrey 414; Yorkshire 229 and 142 for 5 (Bairstow 25, Leaning 13; Virdi 3-52) trail Surrey by 43 runs.All eyes are on Jonny Bairstow after reports that Ed Smith has his eye on handing the gloves to Ben Foakes and moving YJB up the order, which may have contributed to Bairstow’s furious hitting in the first innings. But he’ll do well to extricate Yorkshire from this mess. Yesterday there were three wickets for off-spinner Amar Virdi including Joe Root for 23, who had been out earlier the same day for 14 – both times to 19 year olds. Sam Curran was awarded his county cap after taking 6-54 in Yorkshire’s first innings, becoming the fourth youngest Surrey player to be capped, and the fourth youngest to 100 wickets after Waqar Younis, Martin Bicknell and Jack CrawfordSomerset v Hampshire: Somerset 506; Hampshire 231 and 178 for 2 (Vince 63, Amla 86) trail Somerset by 97 runsThis could be a thriller, watching Vince - in his last innings before the Test team is chosen - and Amla try to bat out the day.  Middlesex v Gloucestershire: Middlesex 455-8 dec; Gloucestershire 210 and 66 for 2 (Roderick 6, Bracey 5)trail Middlesex by 179 runs.Gloucestershire will do very well to escape here and Derbyshire v Durham: Derbyshire 427 and 1-0 (Slater 0, Reece 1); Durham 520. Derbyshire trail Durham by 92 runswhich has draw written all over it.Five games finished yesterday:A thriller at New Road where Essex came from behind to win by 32 runs, with Worcester now cut adrift at the bottom of the table. Lancashire beat Nottinghamshire by an innings and 67 runs to register their first win of the season, with nine wickets for Graham Onions and six for Jimmy Anderson. In Division two, Warwickshire beat Northants by six wickets, thanks to a century from Will Rhodes, and already look a pretty safe bet to bounce back to Division one at the end of the season. Northants can already taste the grain of the wooden spoon . And in two relatively low scoring games, Leicestershire beat Glamorgan by three, yes three, runs for their third Championship win since 2012, and Kent beat Sussex by 58 and kicked them out of second place. Matt Henry took ten wickets in the match.One of many reasons why the championship is so bloody great: the players of @leicsccc and @GlamCricket enjoy a beer together after a truly epic three days of cricket. pic.twitter.com/QiduYOy0Dh In other news: Ireland are following on in their first Test against Pakistan at Malahide where the weather is an unhelpful grey today and where Mick Jagger was spotted yesterday.

England’s bold new era proved something of a damp squib after a limp batting performance on day one at Lord’s left them facing an uphill battle in the first Test with Pakistan.There was one negative for Pakistan, though, as they were spoken to by the ICC anti-corruption officer after a couple of their players were spotted wearing what appeared to be smart watches out in the middle.Joe Root, the England captain who has called on his players to up the ante after a poor winter, was as culpable as any of the batsmen with a loose drive as he went for four; their sub-par 184 all out that followed was compounded when the tourists reached 50 for one in reply.Not since 1955 against South Africa have England won the toss at Lord’s and returned a lower total batting first – from 133 all out they went on to win by 71 runs. Alastair Cook, who top-scored with 70, is now hoping for a similar turnaround.Reflecting on a collapse that began from 149 for four and saw Mohammad Abbas and Hasan Ali share eight wickets, the former captain said: “We scrapped hard and knew the first two hours would be tough. It’s frustrating, we needed a lower-order partnership and 270/280 changes the day. [The wicket] did more than we expected. It did swing and nip all day. But if bowlers missed lengths or lines, you could score.“Pakistan bowled good lines and lengths and got their rewards. It could be one of those first innings plays fourth-innings matches. Or I could be totally wrong. They gutsed it out well but their 50 for one could be 80 for four, 120 for seven and the game changes.”On the dismissal of Root, who has returned to No 3, Cook added: “We’ve all played a bad shot and will play another; as a batter you don’t mean to nick it. Sometimes you have to hold your hands up and say ‘bad shot’. But the bloke averages 50 and is a world-class player, so we don’t need to worry. If he scores 150 in the second innings it doesn’t matter, does it?”While there was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Pakistan, an ICC spokesman told ESPNcricinfo: “Apple watches in any way connected to a phone/Wifi or in any way capable of receiving comms such as messages, are not allowed. In effect, it is considered a phone unless ‘disabled’ and just a watch.”Hasan, who took a career-best four for 51, added: “Yes, the anti-corruption officer came to us and told us this is not allowed, so nobody will wear it again. I don’t know who was wearing one.”"

Eoin Morgan has withdrawn from the World XI’s T20 match against West Indies at Lord’s on Thursday because of a fractured ring finger on his right hand.Morgan sustained the injury while fielding on Sunday at backward point for Middlesex against Somerset. He expects to be fit in time for England’s first one-day international against Australia on 13 June. The injury means Shahid Afridi has taken over the World XI captaincy, while Sam Billings has been called up as a replacement batsman. Sam Curran and Tymal Mills have also been added to their squad.The World XI squad include players from England, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal. Andy Flower, the coach, described the team as a “Barbarians‑type side” and he wants them to play Barbarian‑style cricket, too. “If we can play an entertaining game then everyone will be happy.”The West Indies captain, Carlos Brathwaite, on the other hand, said he will be treating it as “a proper full international game – the reason we’re playing the game is for charity but there’s a lot of pride involved”.The match has been organised to raise funds to repair damage caused by hurricanes Irma and Maria to cricket grounds in Dominica, Anguilla, Antigua, St Maarten and St Thomas. “It happened eight months ago so it’s not that current in the public consciousness but it’s a great cricketing cause,” Flower said.The damage was particularly severe at Windsor Park in Dominica, where the roof, TV towers, and electronic scoreboard were destroyed. It will cost around $6m (£4.5m) to restore the stadium.Some Dominican residents have pointed out that given how much damage was caused across the country, repairing the stadium is not particularly high on the list of priorities. But the West Indies coach, Stuart Law, pointed out that the sooner the ground is rebuilt the sooner the team can go back and play games there, “which will give them a bit of financial support as well”. He added: “It’s coming up to a year on from the hurricane now and there are still people severely affected by it.”Brathwaite said: “It’s very important, and I want to personally thank all and sundry who have conspired to get the game up and running.” A good friend was in Dominica at the time of the hurricane and was listed as missing. “When it happens close to home then you really understand the effects, so thanks again for putting the game on, it’s something very close to my heart.”Brathwaite hopes a permanent fund will be established, “something that can be contributed to annually”, so that next time a hurricane comes the islands will not have to wait so long for support. “You never know when disaster will strike, and having that fund in place means whenever disaster does strike people will be able to get funds almost immediately. We know in the aftermath of a tragedy the first hundred or so days are the hardest.”Tickets for the World XI match are available at www.lords.org.The ICC Cricket Committee has recommended increased sanctions for ball‑tampering and a new offence relating to personal abuse.Both matters were to the fore in Australia’s Test tour of South Africa this year, which ended with the former Australia captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner banned for a year and the batsman Cameron Bancroft for nine months after the latter damaged the ball with sandpaper.Many of the numerous other flashpoints in a bad-tempered series could be covered by the recommended new offence of “personal, insulting, offensive or orchestrated abuse”.Warner and the South Africa wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock clashed in a stairwell during the third Test, the Australia spinner Nathan Lyon dropped the ball on AB de Villiers while celebrating a run-out. The Proteas bowler Kagiso Rabada was also banned for a game after a shoulder‑bump on Smith took him over the International Cricket Council’s demerit points threshold. Rabada was reprieved on appeal.Anil Kumble, the committee chairman, said in a statement: “The group felt that excessive personal abuse and ball-tampering were serious offences in the game and that should be reflected in the way in which they are dealt with.“There was also strong support for giving the match officials more authority and subsequently greater support around their decision-making.”The latter aim will include authorising the match referee to upgrade or downgrade the level of an offence or sanction. The committee also recommended the creation of a “Code of Respect” for players and another new offence of “attempting to gain an unfair advantage”. PA"

Jos Buttler has admitted he is a luxury in England’s re-fitted Test team and that his return will divide opinion. But as the side’s most potent white-ball weapon prepares for a third stab at the longest format, he says the plan this time is to play on instinct.How Buttler fares in the series with Pakistan that starts at Lord’s on Thursday will make one of the most intriguing subplots during the early Test summer as Joe Root’s side look to return to winning ways after their winter of discontent.Can such a talent, fresh from wreaking havoc as an opener in the Indian Premier League but someone who has not faced a red Dukes ball since the end of last season with Lancashire, really come off as a specialist game changer at No 7?Though not entirely new territory, given the last three of his 18 caps came in the same role during the 2016 tour of India, the 27-year-old is planning a fresh mindset as he looks to repay a significant show of faith from the new national selector, Ed Smith, and Root.“It is a luxury role for a side to have,” said Buttler, before his first training session back. “For me it is about trusting instincts and not fighting them. In the past I have potentially felt as if I had to play in a certain way or be something I am not. So as much as I can I will be trusting my instincts. That is going to be the best way to be successful.”His regret refers chiefly to the 2015 Ashes when, having registered half-centuries in five of his first eight Tests, Buttler went into his shell and appeared to lose the location of his off stump. Two matches into the following winter in United Arab Emirates and he was forced to hand over the wicketkeeping gloves to Jonny Bairstow.Buttler said: “I have learned a lot about myself over the past two years. If you are going to fail, fail in a genuine way and not someone else’s way. It’s going to be a challenge but from the conversations I’ve had with Joe and Ed Smith, it’s very much they want me to play the way that suits me and in the fashion they believe will get the best out of me.”His recall is one in which his perceived ability has trumped his form in this format. Indeed, Buttler was himself surprised when, while waiting for a match between his Rajasthan Royals side and Kolkata Knightriders, and with a record-equalling run of five successive IPL half-centuries behind him, he got the call.So with just four first-class centuries to his name – the last of which came four years ago when newly transferred from Taunton to Old Trafford – and an exclusive diet of white-ball cricket this year, Buttler accepts that some of the county batsmen who had hoped to force their way into the Test team may feel aggrieved.Buttler said: “I’m very aware that I’m the beneficiary of opinions. I don’t know whether there’s a right or wrong. Everyone has an opinion. That’s why sport is so interesting. I’ve been afforded an amazing opportunity to come and play and one that I’m excited about. I am accepting of the noise around it. That’s outside my control.“It shows that people are very open-minded and there’s not only one way in to national selection. If anything that should benefit guys as you can do things your way. Whatever opportunities are afforded to you, you shouldn’t be worried about taking them for risk of saying: ‘If I go and play in a tournament somewhere that’s my red-ball ambitions finished.’”As Root’s side ready themselves for Pakistan, one such tournament is a hot topic of discussion, with the Test players present at Lord’s being briefed in small groups on the England and Wales Cricket Board’s latest thinking regarding The Hundred.Reaction around the county squads has been lukewarm but the hope is that by getting the international cricketers on board – via presentations from the tournament director, Sanjay Patel, and its architect, Mike Fordham – some positivity may trickle down.Asked for his take on the new 100-ball concept, Buttler replied: “People don’t necessarily accept change readily. I’m sure in 2003, when Twenty20 was introduced, it was seen as such a radical move. Gradually, it’s been accepted and has done really well.“There are some fantastic ideas behind The Hundred and what it’s trying to achieve. If it can fulfil those ambitions then it’s going to be great for cricket. If it’s got the best players around the world and the best players in England, I’m sure it’s going to be successful.”"

After that little oasis of serenity on Saturday evening, England reverted to type. In the space of 25 minutes wild hopefulness gave way to grim haplessness as their second innings subsided from 235 for six to 242 all out. No one was predicting an England victory overnight but it was reasonable to expect that the rearguard action might still be in operation at noon and that they could head to Leeds this week with something to savour.Instead they will travel north humbled and humiliated, with their confidence in shreds having been thrashed on their own patch at headquarters by a side ranked seventh in the world, two places below them – though that will change if England perform as ineptly at Headingley. Pakistan won by nine wickets; they performed superbly but unspectacularly like solid old pros who understood the prevailing conditions precisely. And they are supposed to be the callow side. Pakistan bowled full and straight and let the ball swing and seam a little; they batted with grit and patience and they caught their catches. That was more than enough to overwhelm an England team in some disarray.The England collapse on Sunday morning was numbing. Jos Buttler had batted with great authority on Saturday but in the second over he pushed forward to Mohammad Abbas and was struck on the pad. He reviewed but with no great optimism. Then the new ball polished off the rest at a rush. Mark Wood and Stuart Broad were both caught behind and last man out Dom Bess lost his off stump. Mohammad Amir and Abbas were in clover, taking four wickets each in the innings.In pursuit of the 64 runs needed to win Pakistan lost Azhar Ali to a fine delivery from Jimmy Anderson. Thereafter there were few alarms. Unlike the first innings, Bess made several deliveries turn but in a hopeless situation he was nowhere near accurate enough to exploit the rough developing outside the left‑handers’ off stump. Rather than inform us about the long-term prospects of Bess excelling at this level, this simply demonstrated what an excellent cricket pitch had been provided at Lord’s, even though England had been woefully unable to exploit its properties. It seamed at the start; it flattened out and if we had reached the fifth day it would have spun.The scale of this defeat has been so emphatic and unexpected that there will be a hue and cry, which will incorporate calls for the sacking of Trevor Bayliss and/or Joe Root – it seems a little bit early to demand the head of the new national selector, Ed Smith. Of course, Bayliss and Root will continue unless Andy Flower, who is standing in for Andrew Strauss this summer, makes the most spectacular of interventions so early in his role as a locum.Yet it would be a surprise – and a mistake – if England arrived in Leeds with exactly the same squad. This does not feel like one of those occasions where a defiant selector or coach bellows “same team, different performance, please”. So these are interesting times for Bayliss and Smith and there will be an early indication of how they view the selection process.At Lord’s we have witnessed a listless, tepid performance from the batsmen, many of whom look haunted by the prospect of another failure that might terminate their careers. The inclusions of Buttler and Bess were modest successes and, if nothing else, they surely highlighted the benefit of fresh faces and minds, which see challenges rather than almighty burdens.At crisis moments like this selectors must clarify their priorities. They can become tortured and confused if they decide that “fairness” is priority number one; that should not be the case. Priority number one is to pick the best team for the next match. It might be unfair to drop Mark Stoneman for Headingley after just one Test this summer but it is incredibly hard to conclude that he is currently England’s best bet at the top of the order.All the signs are that Stoneman can be only a modest Test batsman; to achieve that he has to be in good form and full of confidence. Patently that is not the case at the moment. Indeed, we may be reaching a stage when dropping him is almost doing him a favour. By the same token Dawid Malan, even though he has a little more credit in the bank, does not really convince. He battled hard in the Ashes series; indeed, he looked more comfortable than most on harder, bouncier pitches. Since then Test cricket has been a struggle. It might be even more unfair to omit Malan for Headingley but it must also be a consideration. Despite witnessing the capriciousness of the selectors in the 80s and 90s my view is that the trend now is to slavishly stick to the same men until the evidence that they should be dropped is incontrovertible. Maybe it is time to anticipate a decline.The problem for Smith and Bayliss is that the names of likely replacements are not obvious. Just about the only potential England opener yet to march out with Alastair Cook is Middlesex’s Nick Gubbins, who has enjoyed a prolific start to the season. If he has a weakness against spin, which has been suggested, it is unlikely to be critical against Pakistan at Headingley. Other alternatives are, by definition, not entirely convincing – otherwise they would already be in the team. They range from the 33-year-old James Hildreth to the 22-year-old Joe Clarke, neither of whom has played Test cricket, to recent has-beens such as James Vince and Keaton Jennings. My impression, albeit after a solitary Test this summer, is that it is time to twist rather than stick."

Gary Wilson praised Ireland’s openers for displaying “big balls” after following on against Pakistan, having shown serious courage himself in making an unbeaten 33 despite a possible fracture to his elbow.The Irish face a fight to avoid a heavy defeat in their inaugural Test after the tourists ripped through their top order, eventually dismissing them inside 48 overs for 130, 180 behind Pakistan’s 310 for nine declared. However, they had moved within 116 runs of that total with all 10 second‑innings wickets still in hand at stumps on day three thanks to an unbroken stand of 64 by Ed Joyce and William Porterfield.“We’re [less than] 120 behind, we know we’re going to have to bat really well but I think the two lads showed at the end there that it’s definitely possible,” Wilson said. “It looked like Pakistan maybe had the ball reversing slightly towards the end. If they’re trying to get the ball reversing, they obviously think there’s enough in the wicket for the batters. That’s definitely a plus point for us.“We know the first hour, first session tomorrow is going to be really key to try and set the game up for us. We’re confident. Whenever you’re asked to follow on and you can go 60 for none at the close, that shows big balls, so I think we can take good confidence from that.”Nobody showed more guts than Wilson, who was unable to field in the morning having been struck on the back of the elbow in the warm-up.The 33-year-old returned from hospital hoping to avoid batting, but with Ireland slumping from seven for four to 61 for six, Wilson came in down the order at nine after taking painkillers. And he displayed some lower-order resistance in making an unbeaten 33, despite being unable to play many of his regular strokes, to ensure the Irish moved beyond the lowest score ever recorded by a team in their first Test innings.“I went for an x-ray and there might be a little crack there. It’s unconfirmed,” Wilson said. “It’s probably the most pain I’ve been in when batting. It was pretty sore. I was able to get through it, got us up to 130, which [was] probably not ideal [for] where we want to be, but I thought the two boys at the end there were unbelievable. To go back out, that showed proper guts.“The adrenaline sort of kicked in and I didn’t want to miss a chance to bat in the Test match. They just drugged me up and I got out there and got on with it. You’ve got a bit of a responsibility to get out there. At one point, whenever I got back [from hospital], I thought I was literally only going to try and hold an end up. It was pretty pleasing to get out there and play some sort of an innings.”"

The O’Brien boys used to play at the Ashes in the back garden. During the summer they would stage long one-on-one Test matches, each always taking the same part. Back then Niall was a batsman whose hero was Steve Waugh, so he would be Australia, and Kevin was a bowler who idolised Darren Gough, so he’d be England. “That’s where I learned the game, in the back garden with Nialler,” Kevin says. “Toughest cricket I ever played.” It never occurred to them to pick Ireland even though their father played 50 games for the national team. “Honestly, I never believed Ireland would ever play Test cricket,” Kevin says. “Not in my career.”Last Sunday afternoon Ireland were doing exactly that. It was the third day of their first Test match, against Pakistan at Malahide and the dream had suddenly become a nightmare. They were seven for four, 300 runs behind and belly up. What’s worse is that it was happening on the same day Cricket Ireland had picked for their big party. They had invited every living cricketer who had played for Ireland along to watch. Eighty came. “Which added to the pressure,” Kevin says, “because we knew they were living and breathing every ball along with us.”Kevin was the next man in. He had been playing all his life but had hardly any first-class experience to draw on. Just 40-odd games, most of them for Ireland against the other associate nations, plus a single match for Surrey, another for Nottinghamshire and a handful for Leinster in the new inter-provincial competition. There was nothing there to tell him how to bat when, in your first Test, the team are seven for four and Pakistan are on a tear. But he had played 125 ODIs, more than any other Test debutant in history. So he decided to do what he knew best.“There was nothing left to lose,” O’Brien says. “It already looked like we could be 50 all out so it couldn’t get any worse.”Seven years earlier O’Brien was at the crease in Bangalore when Ireland were 111 for five chasing England’s 327 in the 2011 World Cup. The decision he made now was similar to the one he had taken then. “I decided to try and counterattack, to put some pressure back on the bowlers.” In Bangalore he made 113 from 63 balls; in Malahide it was 40 from 68. But those 40 runs steered Ireland away from the rocks.Belief began to course through the team. Pakistan made Ireland follow-on that evening but their openers, Ed Joyce and William Porterfield, batted through to the close, reaching 64 for nought. “That was the key partnership,” O’Brien says. “It showed us we could compete at this level.”The next day,O’Brien did more than compete. Coming in at 95 for four, by the close he was unbeaten on 118, the first Test century for Ireland. He could not add to that the following day but Ireland made 339 and had Pakistan 14 for three in the chase. In the end Pakistan won by five wickets but Ireland had proved they could handle themselves in Test cricket.“People have asked me which innings I preferred and I’d have to say it was the hundred in Bangalore,” O’Brien says. “Because it was against England, because it was the World Cup and, most of all, because we won.”The Test left him with mixed emotions. “I’m very proud and happy with the century but ultimately I’m disappointed that we couldn’t put Pakistan under even more pressure.”He blames himself. “If I’d just pushed on the next morning and got those few extra runs, even another 30, it could have been different.”Instead, he was caught swinging at his first ball on the fifth morning. “It was a lesson,” he says. “I got too caught up in everything the night before. I was still dealing with all the congratulations, the text messages and that, before I went out to bat. I wish I had left all that till after the match.”That was one of the ways in which Test cricket surprised him. “There were the little things, like at one point Pakistan had a spinner on and seven men fielding on the leg side and I’ve never faced anything like that in my career. But the large thing was just how much concentration it takes to play Test cricket. We played well, bowled well, batted well, in periods, but the best teams in the world do it for seven hours a day, day in, day out, and that’s the next challenge for us.”Whether O’Brien will be the one to take it on he isn’t sure. He is 34 and one of a group of senior players who are coming to the end. “You are going to see a couple of retirements in the next couple of seasons,” he says. “The team could lose six or seven of us, so it’s imperative Ireland blood some new players as quickly as they can.”O’Brien is already thinking of what he can do to help. He is midway through his level three coaching certificate and the day after the Test finished he was in the nets at his old club in Dublin working with the next generation of players.When they were young, the O’Briens had to keep their backyard matches quiet. They went to school in inner-city Dublin and if the other kids knew they played the “English” sport instead of hurling, rugby or Gaelic football, then “we might have come in for a few hidings”. It’s different now.Somewhere in Ireland this summer there will be a couple of schoolkids playing Test cricket in their back garden, one-on-one. They won’t need to hush it up and they won’t have to pretend to be England or Australia any more.Next up, IndiaIreland’s fixtures27 June T20 v India Malahide 29 June T20 v India Malahide "

Back in 2010, that annus horribilis for Pakistan cricket, Hasan Ali’s parents set alight his whites after becoming frustrated with a sporting obsession that appeared to have taken priority over his studies and their dream of him one day becoming a lawyer.The previous year Hasan and his elder brother had made their own pitch by hand, digging a two-foot deep trench before filling it with concrete and asking a local bricklayer to help smooth it over. Needless to say, this was a young man already set on making it as a professional, just not the kind his mother and father had envisaged.At Lord’s on Thursday, when morning rain made way for watery sunshine and the surface offered a touch more vegetation than his home-made strip back in Gujranwala, Hasan was one part of an impressive Pakistan attack that, like his folks and those whites, left England’s hopes of a new dawn, after their winter of antipodean angst, somewhat burned.The meek 184 all out from Joe Root’s side will doubtless lead to criticism of a lineup that, despite some tinkering, still seems hugely dependent on individuals coming off rather than collective solidity. But credit must go to the tourists too, for whom Hasan and the eye-catching Mohammad Abbas took four wickets apiece.From a 2-2 series draw two years ago that left supporters wishing for a decider, Pakistan have somehow wound up as the hors d’oeuvres this summer, ushered in before the visit of Australia for some one-dayers and then the Test headliners, India. But despite their batting lineup being shorn of Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan, and their ranking having tumbled from No 1 to No 7 in the intervening time, this bowling unit was never going to be a pushover.Though much of the pre-series focus was on Mohammad Amir, and a plan to replicate the lengths that led New Zealand’s Trent Boult to slice through England in Auckland, it was Abbas who set the standard. This 28-year-old right-armer has already made a strong start to his Test career and in this, his seventh match, he looked tailor-made for English conditions with a smooth action, exemplary wrist control and a desire to stay full.Just ask Mark Stoneman, who was adjusting to a series of balls that had beaten the outside edge before being castled by one that nipped back in, or Ben Stokes, trapped lbw on review by a ball that with the naked eye looked to have pitched outside leg. Like South Africa’s Vernon Philander, Abbas gets tight on the stumps and stands the seam up beautifully to ask questions of top-order techniques, or those lower down such as Stuart Broad and the debutant Dom Bess.The more slippery Hasan is better known in these parts, having transferred that concrete schooling to white-ball cricket and wound up player of the tournament in last year’s Champions Trophy, where his bomb-detonating wicket celebration exploded 13 times in all. Here it followed Root channelling his inner James Vince, Dawid Malan’s indifferent footwork, Jos Buttler channelling his inner Root and a late bonus from Mark Wood; Hasan’s ability to keep the older ball still swinging is a fine attribute from first-change.The support acts in the wickets column should not pass without mention, with Faheem Ashraf and Amir both vying for the ball of the day. Faheem, the all-rounder in a five-man attack, ended Jonny Bairstow’s return to No 5 with one that looked to be angling down the hill only to hold its line and ping the top of off; Amir’s to Alastair Cook, which caught him on the crease, was more timber-rattling porn.While Shadab Khan, the 19-year-old leg-spinner, was always unlikely to be in the game on day one, he did get six overs to bowl and he too is a cricketer of some promise. Provided an inexperienced batting lineup can stand up in this series – Pakistan’s start of 50 for one, under lights, was steady enough – then the bowlers should ensure the visitors are not simply early summer fodder."

Steve Smith’s comeback to cricket has begun, with the suspended former Australia skipper named as a marquee player in Canada’s T20 league, where he will join fellow international stars, including Chris Gayle, Andre Russell and Shahid Afridi in the six-team tournament beginning on 28 June.The 28-year-old was stripped of the captaincy and handed a 12-month suspension from international cricket for his role in the Cape Town Test ball-tampering scandal in March. He admitted having knowledge of the plan but failed to stop Cameron Bancroft using sandpaper to tamper with the ball on the third day of the third Test against South Africa.Smith is also banned for two years from holding a leadership position within the Australian team and he must undertake 100 hours of voluntary service in community cricket. The ban for breaching Cricket Australia’s code of conduct extended to state matches but permitted Smith to play domestic tournaments outside Australia.The Global T20 Canada consists of five Canadian teams and a Cricket West Indies representative team, made up entirely of players from the Caribbean. A draft to determine who plays where will be held next week.Bancroft, along with former vice-captain David Warner, have also begun their comebacks after also being suspended over the scandal. Former Test opener Bancroft, who is serving a nine-month suspension, will play for WA club side Willetton next season. Meanwhile, Warner – banned for 12 months – is committed to play a handful of Sydney grade cricket matches with Randwick Petersham."

Joe Root feels ready to make a success of England’s troublesome No 3 position after a year spent adjusting to the demands of being both Test captain and premier batsman.Trevor Bayliss has long argued for it to be the Yorkshireman’s ideal berth but while the England coach had his way for the bulk of 2016 – a career-best 254 against Pakistan resulted – Root’s replacing of Alastair Cook as captain last year prompted a move back down to No 4.After a chastening winter that brought series defeats to Australia and New Zealand, and with Ed Smith bringing fresh ideas as the new national selector, Root returns to first drop in place of James Vince as part of revamped batting order to face Pakistan at Lord’s next Thursday.“It’s an opportunity for me to take on a bit more responsibility,” Root said. “I’ve had a year in the captaincy now and I feel I’ve gained enough experience to feel comfortable doing that.“For me it was getting used to the captaincy and making sure I could separate the two; that my full focus was on my batting when it came around. Ultimately nothing will change the way I go about my batting. I will look to have that hunger and desire to make really big runs.”Smith stressed it was Root who pushed for the promotion, with the reshuffle chiefly about getting Jonny Bairstow up to No 5 while still retaining the gloves. Jos Buttler, fresh from a marauding time in the Indian Premier League slots in as a specialist batsman at No 7 some eight months since his last first-class outing for Lancashire.Root, speaking at the launch of England’s latest New Balance kit, said: “It is really important Jos does not put too much pressure on himself. It is about expressing himself and finding consistency. It is exciting but it might take a bit of time to come right. If he bats for any period of time, especially the way he’s played recently, it’s going to be very exciting.”The second of the two-match series with Pakistan will coincide with Virat Kohli’s arrival for a month-long spell at Surrey. It includes three championship matches against the red Dukes ball for the India captain before his side take on England over five Tests.Root’s verdict? “He’s got to play against Yorkshire at Scarborough so that might get him out of nick. Steve Patterson might nibble him out a couple of times.”In the Royal London Cup, Tom Westley gave a reminder of his ability to the England selectors in Essex’s six-wicket win over Middlesex at Radlett. Westley, who won five Test caps last summer before being omitted for the winter tours, hit 134 and shared a second-wicket partnership of 153 with Varun Chopra as last year’s semi-finalists won with 7.2 overs to spare.Sussex were also comfortable Group B winners with a seven-wicket victory over Kent at Hove. Luke Wells produced a man-of-the-match show as his leg spin helped dismiss Kent for 188, opener Daniel Bell-Drummond the last out for 90 from 115 balls. Wells took two for 30 and then anchored Sussex’s response with 62 from 89 balls.Derbyshire proved too strong for Group A rivals Warwickshire with a 57-run victory at Edgbaston. Captain Billy Godleman hit a career-best 137 from 116 balls as Derbyshire hit 357 for eight.Sam Hain struck a classy 108 in response - his sixth list A century in only 30 games - but he received little support other than an unbeaten 48 from Keith Barker.Leicestershire eased home by 72 runs at Northamptonshire after Paul Horton’s 103 in 126 balls guided them to a challenging 265 for seven.Northants have been badly short of runs so far this season and Gavin Griffiths (4-30) and Ben Raine (3-31) did the damage as the home side slumped to 124 for eight. Only late resistance from Graeme White and Brett Hutton, sharing 64 for the ninth wicket, avoided a complete humiliation before the hosts were dismissed for 193 in 38.2 overs."

Come Thursday there will be that unique hum of excited conversation around the stands at Lord’s. The ground will look a picture, the sun should be shining and when the two decorously blazered captains make their way to the middle for the toss all will seem well with the cricketing world. This may be a veneer of contentment and calm since the game in this country is in a state of flux (say the optimists) or crisis (say the pessimists).Still, as the umpires make their way through the Long Room there will be a ripple of applause and another international summer of cricket will be under way.It begins with two Tests against Pakistan, followed by white-ball matches against Scotland, Australia and India and then there is a five‑Test series against India, which is due to come to a conclusion on 11 September at the Oval.On the radar this summer we note the arrival of the Australians, minus nearly all of their pantomime villains – and their best players – a squad that will have to silently endure a few jibes along the way. At the same time Virat Kohli will be playing Championship cricket for Surrey, which is quite an event.Like Cheteshwar Pujara at Yorkshire and Matt Renshaw at Somerset, there is a major element of self‑interest here as these players seek to gain experience before playing Test cricket in England. But their presence does suggest that Championship cricket is not as moribund or unattractive as some suggest. In August Ben Stokes will miss the Lord’s Test against India because he will be in court.But the radar is not always reliable. We all turned up for the Tests in New Zealand in March expecting Stokes to be the focus of our attention but he barely warranted a mention as we ended up concentrating on ball-tampering in Cape Town and a nation in shock on the other side of the Tasman. Something will surprise us.The international season starts against a backdrop of uncertainty about the English game and the ability of the England and Wales Cricket Board to look after it. I have yet to meet anyone not employed by the ECB who approves of The Hundred, even though it is, according to Colin Graves (if not his chief executive), “set in stone”.Having sleepwalked this far, the counties not hosting the new competition are keeping their heads down, awaiting their annual boost of £1.3m and hoping to ensure that the T20 Blast is not too damaged.Only the players can apply the brake now so expect them to be lured by the prospect of additional riches by the ECB. Sacrificed along the way is the burgeoning Kia Super League, the women’s T20 competition, which has been deemed such a success, especially in the shires. They must play The Hundred in the cities as well.A working group has been set up to look at the game’s domestic structure to be chaired by Wasim Khan, the CEO of Leicestershire, and including Hugh Morris, the CEO of Glamorgan, whose club did or did not receive £2.5m from the ECB, depending on whether you believe the club’s accounts or the ECB’s chairman. Meanwhile, Barry O’Brien resigned as Glamorgan’s chairman 10 days ago so that he could take up a position on the ECB’s executive board, even though “an external review” of that payment is still under way. All this fails to inspire much confidence.No wonder the ECB is looking for a healthy diversion in the form of some exhilarating international cricket. It is hard to argue that England against Pakistan represents the pinnacle of Test cricket at the moment. England, after their five defeats in seven Test matches in the winter, are ranked No 5 in the world; Pakistan won in Ireland last week but they lost their previous series, against Sri Lanka in the United Arab Emirates, last autumn and they are ranked seventh. But on a good day at Lord’s those rankings can seem an irrelevance; the occasion takes over.Ed Smith has surprised us with the inclusion of Jos Buttler as a specialist No 7, not an unprecedented move since Derek Randall and Mike Gatting batted there occasionally in the distant past, but an unusual one. If Buttler succeeds, which would be quite an achievement given that he has not faced a red ball since September last year, and others fail up the order that situation may change. It does not feel like a permanent role.Meanwhile Somerset’s fresh-faced Dom Bess, as a consequence of the injury to his club-mate Jack Leach and the off-spinner’s own stunning start to first-class cricket, will make his debut if the forecast for sunshine is correct.The logic of elevating Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow in the order is hard to fault. Perhaps they can now impose upon the opposition rather than be compelled to launch the rescue act. Under greatest scrutiny among the batsmen are the openers. Alastair Cook’s winter problems were masked by a monumental innings in Melbourne, while there was little sign of Mark Stoneman improving as a Test player. Among the bowlers England must decide whether Chris Woakes, who has been far more potent at home than away in his Test career, or Mark Wood should be included in the final XI.Pakistan are rebuilding under the captaincy of Sarfraz Ahmed, their inspirational little keeper. If fully fit, Mohammad Amir provides the greatest threat with the ball. Since the retirements of Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq, Azhar Ali is the senior batsman and the one with the best pedigree is the 22-year-old Imam-ul-Haq, who is Inzamam’s nephew – although I doubt whether he yet retires to a wicker chair on the outfield once he has completed his net."

The French Open lost another fine player from the men’s draw when Hyeon Chung withdrew on Wednesday – and it looks as if he will miss Wimbledon too.“I have been struggling with an ankle injury the entire clay season,” the 22-year-old South Korean said, simultaneously pulling out of Roland Garros and this week’s Lyon tournament where he had hoped to test his fitness. He follows Milos Raonic out of the season’s second slam, which starts on Sunday, further depleting a field missing Roger Federer and Andy Murray. Rafael Nadal’s odds shorten by the day.Chung, forced to quit his Australian Open semi-final against Federer because of blisters, says he might require “a small procedure” to fix a build-up of gathering fluid in the ankle joint, followed by “an extended period of rest”. It doesn’t sound as if he’ll be ready for Wimbledon, which starts on 2 July.And will six weeks be enough for Andy Murray to make it to the line for his favourite tournament? The odds are lengthening despite the best efforts of Marcel Hunze, the Libema Open tournament director at Murray’s putative comeback event in the Netherlands, the week after the French Open. “After consulting his team, we don’t have any reason to doubt his participation,” Hunze told BBC Scotland.Murray’s team tell the Guardian, meanwhile, that the 31-year-old will not play again “until 100 per cent fit” – which has been the standard reply to all inquiries ever since he limped out of Wimbledon nearly a year ago, and repeated often in response to fevered speculation in recent weeks. Given his stop-start rehab this summer, it is difficult to imagine Murray’s hip has yet fully recovered from surgery in January, and sources insist he is still struggling. But if anyone can defy the odds, it is the three-time grand slam champion.Heather Watson broke a six-match losing stretch this week when she beat the world No 76 Kateryna Bondarenko (one place ahead of her in the rankings) in a drawn-out struggle, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (3) in the first round in Nuremburg. Watson then lost 6-3, 6-3 to the little-known Hungarian Fanny Stollar on Wednesday, however, though the Briton will be looking to build on what was a first main-draw tournament win for four months with the grass-court season looming.Laura Robson, who once jousted with Watson for the No 1 spot in the British rankings, has slid to 221 in the world and, at 24, is battling away in doubles matches on the ITF circuit in front of small crowds for minuscule purses. Her stop-start journey back from a wrist injury has been one of the sport’s toughest to witness, but her love of the game clearly sustains her. As it does all of them.One of the most uplifting sights of the weekend was the 36-year-old Tommy Robredo, a former top-10 player, crying his eyes out after winning a Challenger title in Lisbon, his first success in five years.Bruno Soares, Jamie Murray’s doubles partner, was moved to comment on social media, “So when you say someone should stop or quit playing, think twice. Only we know how much we love this sport and how much we love competing. We stop when we want.”Robredo is the only player in the Open era to come back from two sets down three times in a row, which he memorably did to reach the quarter-finals of the French Open in 2013. On Tuesday, he lost out on Court 18 at Roland Garros, in a qualifier."

Kyle Edmund followed up his win over Novak Djokovic by overpowering David Goffin to move into his first Masters quarter-final at the Madrid Open. The British No 1, having secured one of the biggest victories of his career against the 12-time grand slam champion Djokovic, defeated Goffin, the world No 10, 6-3, 6-3.Edmund, who will break into the world’s top 20 for the first time next week, will face another player on the rise, Denis Shapovalov, in the last eight. The teenager got the better of his fellow Canadian Milos Raonic in a 6-4, 6-4 win. Edmund’s success against Goffin was never in much doubt, as he outplayed an opponent who was put on the back foot and forced into several errors. The 23-year-old broke the Belgian’s serve in the opening game and retained control, losing only four points in his first four service games and taking the first set in 32 minutes when he broke Goffin again.Edmund saved two break points on his first service game in the second set, digging deep as Goffin tried to force his way back into the contest, before closing things out on his third match point in one hour and 12 minutes.“I managed my game very well,” Edmund told Sky Sports. “My game is one where the better I manage it, pick my moments to be aggressive and not pull the trigger too often, then I play well. It’s about being controlled and relaxed and not worrying too much. My serve got me through easy games and also got me out of some tricky situations. He is a top player, so it is very pleasing.”Meanwhile Judy Murray has insisted her son Andy is doing “everything he can” to be fit for Wimbledon in July, after reports this week that his recovery from hip surgery had stalled. “His goal was always to be ready for the grass-court season and, fingers crossed, that will happen,” she told the BBC. “I’m sure when he’s got some news he will share that.”"

Like Roger Federer’s exquisite backhand down the line, all things must pass – and nobody is more aware of the tyranny of time than the Swiss.Still resting from the rigours of clay (the odds on his ever trying again for the French Open are paper-thin), Federer is 37 in August and continues to astound with his longevity. Federer returned to world No 1 this week without lifting a racket after Dominic Thiem stopped Rafael Nadal’s record run of 50 sets in a row in Madrid last week – then the Austrian bowed out in Rome on Wednesday with a spectacular racket-smash when losing to Fabio Fognini.Unless he turns his whole strategy upside down, we will not see Federer on clay again, although nobody would bet against the best-preserved athlete in sport adding to his eight Wimbledon titles, given the paucity of in-form, fit and available grass specialists.One observer who has looked closely into the qualities of the seemingly ageless Federer is the American sportswriter Jeff Bercovici, whose new book, Play On: How To Get Better With Age, is an excellent read.The secret, Bercovici says, is love. “In interview after interview since his 30th birthday, Federer has attributed his longegvity to a deep and abiding love of tennis,” he writes. “To hear him tell it, he … is just a big kid out there. ’I grew up playing against walls and cupboard and garage doors, and I still enjoy it.’”One presumes he no longer needs to bash the house up but his joy and sense of contentment are still palpable.And he is keeping an eye not only on his peers in Rome this week, while enjoying the Swiss air of his palatial home. When asked for an observation of the ATP’s second NextGen tournament – which will be back in Milan in November – he smiled and said: “They’ll eventually get better and push us out. Pretty simple.”If only it were.Andy Murray is finding his battle with the years more problematic but it is also a love of tennis that keeps him going. However, as he stalls over the exact date of his comeback, could he be considering a most unusual re-entry point: doubles with his brother, Jamie?They have played together 59 times, so it might be more than idle speculation that the younger sibling of Britain’s most decorated tennis family could extend his faltering career by one day teaming up with doubles specialist Jamie once again.Murray was adamant after his exhibition match in Glasgow last November against Federer that he would not return to the Tour until he was “100% fit”. And rightly so. However, it has become clear – well opaque, at least – that, despite intensive rehab over the past five months after hip surgery, he still feels unable to make that cast-iron commitment.Murray, who turned 31 on Tuesday, would seem to have no idea when he will be fit to play again. Rarely has there been such a cloud over his career – not even after his back operation in 2013. The gloomiest scenario is Murray chooses to write off the rest of 2018. If he does, easing back into elite tennis with Jamie next year might prove to be an attractive option. It would require Jamie to suspend his partnership with Bruno Soares, temporarily at least, or after they have played out their commitment. While there are people in tennis who insist Jamie is edgy about playing with his brother, the evidence for that is slim.In the early days of their career, Jamie and Andy were a regular left-right combination on the circuit, winning 35 times between June 2006 and September 2016, as well as six out of six times in Davis Cup – but, intriguingly, never in a grand slam. They won finals in Valencia in 2010 and Tokyo in 2011, and lost in the Bangkok decider in 2006.The road back will be tough, whatever route he takes. This week, Murray’s singles ranking fell to 45; the last time he was rated that low was 19 June 2006, after losing to world No 116 Janko Tipsarevic in the first round of Queens. From there, he began his steady climb to No 1 in the world – a journey that took him 10 years.After the French Open – where he last played in a grand slam – he will drop out of the top 50 and then will be officially unranked. These are all numbers, and they in no way reflect either Murray’s determination or his passion for the game. It is inconceivable we will not seem him on a tennis court again but time and options are shrinking by the day, the week and the month.As it stands, Murray has his name down for the 250 event on grass in Rosmalen in the Netherlands in June, the week after the French Open. The Roland Garros tournament starts on Sunday week. Then there is Queens, followed by Wimbledon but continued inquiries fail to elicit anything more than shuffling feet from his team about whether he really will play in the Netherlands.Murray’s name has yet to appear on the list of wildcards for Loughborough this week (they close on Friday) or an LTA indoor hardcourt tournament that looked suspiciously as if it were invented for his comeback – as did a 250 event in Glasgow last month. He didn’t play in that one, either.He has committed, from a distance, to play in Washington DC on 28 July before the Cincinnati Masters on 11 August and the US Open, which starts two weeks later. If he misses the grass season, will he relish coming back on the hardcourts of America? Unlikely. Grass is his home.None of this is to underplay Jamie’s doubles career. He has won five grand slam titles and he and Soares remain a formidable combination but could family loyalty lead him back to playing with his brother – the way it started over upturned cereal packets across the kitchen table in Dunblane a quarter of a century ago?"

Rafa flashes his language skills, giving some of his interview in Italian. Luckily Twitter is on hand to translate for me. “My first victory here in 2005 was one of the most beautiful victories of my career,” he tells the crowd. “To have this trophy again with me after so many years is really very special.” Amazingle for a man who has been so dominant on clay, this is his first Italian Open title since 2013 (up until then he had won it seven times in nine attempts).

6.35pm BST
18:35

Zverev is gracious - and accurate - in his post-match comments: “You’re the greatest clay court player of all time and I think everybody saw that today,” he tells Nadal. 

6.30pm BST
18:30

A mere 56th clay title for Rafa. But a very big day for Sascha. He was the better player for much of that match - and not because Rafa was playing particularly badly. It is very, very rare to see Rafa dominated on clay as he was by Zverev in the second set and for large stretches of the third. How would today’s match have played out in a year’s time, when Zverev is a year closer to his prime, and Nadal a year further away from his?The 👑 ""King of Clay"" conquers Rome one more time and regains the world number 1 spot! 🎉 @RafaelNadal beats Alexander Zverev 6-1 1-6 6-3 and wins for the 8th time the Internazionali BNL d'Italia 🏆!

It always feels a little cliched to believe that the older, more experienced player will benefit from a rainbreak. Yes, he’s been there before but who’s to say the spectre of old defeats won’t rear up and haunt him? Not if it’s Rafa, apparently. Sascha’s level had dipped slightly before the rain came but he looked good enough to trundle along and hold serve to win the match. But Rafa took control when they came back on and took his chances at the net. And it was those points that appeared to make the difference: both players were about even from the baseline but Rafa won 10 points more at the net.

6.21pm BST
18:21

So, Rafa serves for the match. Something that looked VERY unlikely before the rain came down. Rafa charges the net - he looks very confident now - and for the second point in a row, Sascha misses just long with a lob. 15-0. Sascha then digs out a backhand that angles across court and Rafa can’t return. 15-15. Zverev appears to have decided to attack and to hell with the consequences. He sends a forehand long. 30-15. A beautiful forehand winner from Rafa. 40-15 - two match points. Rafa has a chance at the net to seal it but Zverev sends him wide and he has to stretch for a volley and bundles the ball into the net. Good defence from Sascha there. 40-30. The next time he makes no mistake. Another stretching volley but this time he drops it short and Sascha can’t make it. Rafa wins his eighth Italian Open title. 

6.14pm BST
18:14

Third set: Nadal 6-1, 1-6, 5-3 Zverev* (* denotes server)Does Zverev ever needs a hold here. Let’s see how we go. A good start: big ground strokes have him in charge of the first rally and Rafa eventually capitulates when he nets a forehand. Nadal’s shout volume crescendoes as the point goes on before a big overlooped forehand from Sascha lands wide. Rafa, though, is not playing perfectly and a unforced error from the Spaniard makes it 30-30. And a break point chance! Rafa toys with Zverev from the baseline before creeping in and finishing things off with a smash: 30-40. Ohhhh. And Sascha sets up Rafa beautifully with a drop shot and then a lob but the youngster’s shot drops just long. Break for Rafa.

6.06pm BST
18:06

Third set: *Nadal 6-1, 1-6, 4-3 Zverev (* denotes server)If Rafa does go on to claim the title, we’ll look back at that rainbreak as crucial. Rafa, after all, has been through this type of thing 74,387 times. And he pulls off a beauty to make it 15-0 - an overhead smash as he retreats. The kind of shot he was not making before the break. Zverev lets off a few lazy shots and soon Rafa finds himself at 40-15. Early days but this does not appear to be the same contest we were watching before the break. 

6.02pm BST
18:02

Third set: Nadal 6-1, 1-6, 3-3 Zverev* (* denotes server)Although Zverev dominated the most recent sets, each player won 30 points from the baseline and Rafa actually won slightly more at the net (Sascha did, however, come into the net more as the match wore on - with quite a bit of success). Anyway, Rafa wins the first point after the restart and then forces Sascha into an error at the net to make it 15-30. Wobbles from the young man? Not too much: a big serve puts Rafa on the back foot and we’re soon at 40-30. But some big shots from Nadal eventually wear his opponent down and we’re at deuce. Then Sascha dumps an easy forehand into the net and Rafa has a break point - his first in what seems like a long time. A big first serve from Zverev would have been an ace but it’s called (just) wide and a few shots later Rafa has broken! We’re back on serve. 

5.51pm BST
17:51

And here come the players. Zverev makes his way on to court, followed shortly afterwards by Nadal. We’ll have a brief warm-up and then we can resume. Updated

Zverev is warming up with hit fitness coach, Jez Green, in the tunnel. So a return to play is (hopefully) imminent.

If Zverev does win this final, we will have had repeat winners in both the men’s and women’s tournament. Here’s what happened earlier today:

17:14

Nice to see the ground staff are respecting tradition:...and now the rain is back and a tarp has been pulled over the court (including right over Nadal's meticulously placed water bottle, which they daren't touch). #ibi18

5.12pm BST
17:12

So much for the good weather. The umpire sends the players to the locker room as the rain returns and the covers come on. It looks a little heavier than last time. 

5.07pm BST
17:07

Third set: *Nadal 6-1, 1-6, 2-3 Zverev (* denotes server)Rafa’s comeback is not off to a promising start. He double-faults on the first point after the restart. But things get a whole lot better from then on and a smash makes it 40-15 and we have a hold. Zverev still has the crucial break in this set though.

5.03pm BST
17:03

The players are back on court. Sascha is asking if the court is dry and the tournament director reassures him we’re good to go. The rain wasn’t too heavy at any point, so we resume.

4.58pm BST
16:58

The TV pictures are doing the obligatory rainbreak thing of people putting up umbrellas in slow motion and raindrops splashing off leaves verrrryyy slowly. Will this break give Sascha time to think about the enormity of beating Rafa on clay and destroy his confidence? On the evidence of what we’ve seen so far, I would say no. 

4.55pm BST
16:55

Raindrops are back! Rafa has stopped the slaughter of the last set but he’s nowhere near the level where a comeback looks likely. If only nature would intervene in some way, transforming the momentu... And we’re off! H2O has had its say once again - they don’t call it the blue planet for nothing. We shouldn’t be too long as the sky looks clear elsewhere. “It should be quick,” the tournament director says as he surveys the court.Updated

16:52

Third set: Nadal 6-1, 1-6, 1-3 Zverev* (* denotes server)Those official-looking guys gave the raindrops the staring of their lives and the clouds appear to have cleared. Zverev opens the game with his second ace of the match and follows it up with a leaping smash at the net. He holds his hand up in apology, not sure why. And then a bit of fire from Rafa, he digs out a backhand from under hit feet on the baseline and turns it into a beautiful winner. Magnificent skill just to get that ball back, let alone win the point. Zverev still holds, mind. 

4.47pm BST
16:47

Third set: *Nadal 6-1, 1-6, 1-2 Zverev (* denotes server)We may have a rain break soon, as official-looking types peer hard at the rain courtside. Meanwhile, Rafa remembers that he is quite good at this tennis lark and holds to love. It’s obvious to say he needed that ... but he needed that. 

4.43pm BST
16:43

Third set: Nadal 6-1, 1-6, 0-2 Zverev* (* denotes server)The rain continues to fall but we’re staying on for now. The umpire is telling the crowd to quieten down (I think, my Italian isn’t great/existent). The game is pretty much Rafa scurrying about the court before Sascha unleashes a terrifying winner at the moment. Occasionally Sascha throws in a tired shot to make things interesting, which is nice of him. Rafa makes it to 40-30 before Zverev slams things shut. 

4.38pm BST
16:38

Third set: *Nadal 6-1, 1-6, 0-1 Zverev (* denotes server)Even if Zverev loses this match he is looking like a man who will dominate in the next few years. Imagine this contest when both men are two years older - it may not be too pretty for Rafa. A little slip from Rafa at 15-0 causes a loose shot to make it 15-15 - the indignities of extreme old age. Rafa lost the last set but he never looked particularly rattled. But when he gives up a shot to make it 30-40 he shows real frustartion for the first time. And ... wow. A tremendous, athletic reflex volley at the net saves the game. He allows himself a huge “Vamos!” And very well deserved it is too. The first raindrops fall as Sascha wastes another break point with a subpar backhand into the net. A net cord puts Nadal off his rhythm and it’s enough to set Sascha up for a winner to bring up his 10th break point of the match. And he breaks! Rafa misses an easy-ish volley at the net. 

4.27pm BST
16:27

Rafa is not content to concede this one and save his energy for the next set. He leaps out to a 0-30 lead before a big ol’ smash at the net - Sascha’s 10th winner of the set - makes it 15-30. Another smash has us at 30-30. That was a fairly emphatic way to end any insurrection. A lovely, lazy backhand down the line seals the set. Who saw that coming after the dusting up in the first. Zverev had 12 winners to just one from Rafa in the second. We said the German had to win more points on his first serve - he won 71% in the second. 

4.23pm BST
16:23

Second set: *Nadal 6-1, 1-5 Zverev (* denotes server)When was the last time Rafa was 0-5 down on clay? Anyone out there know the last time he lost a set 6-0 on this surface. When he was four maybe? If only there was some kind of social media platform where people could supply information in real time. Hang on!The last player to bagel Rafael #Nadal on clay:Roger Federer (Hamburg 2007)Anyway, Rafa is keen to avoid that little stat and a big serve takes him to 30-0. He then holds. Another record for Roger to hang on to.

4.17pm BST
16:17

Second set: Nadal 6-1, 0-5 Zverev* (* denotes server)More drop shots from Sascha. Rafa gets to this one but he cuts it wide and Zverev has a 15-0 lead. Then Sascha plays another one which should have set him up with an easy volley winner but he sends it long. He’s missed a few easy points today. That takes us to 15-30 and Rafa’s best passage of play in quite a while. Until he dumps a return long the next point - Rafa has eight unforced errors this set to four last time around. Another hold for Zverev. 

4.14pm BST
16:14

Second set: *Nadal 6-1, 0-4 Zverev (* denotes server)Those storm clouds are rolling on the horizon but it’s dry on court at the moment. A few games ago it seemed a given that Rafa would finish this one off so quickly we wouldn’t need to worry about the weather. But now? Oh boy. Sascha has now won more points in this set than he did in the entirety of the first. His backhand is causing Rafa all kinds of problems but he wastes a chance at 15-40 to go a double break up, netting with Rafa in no-man’s land. He reacted very well after a wasted opportunity in the first game of the set how will he do this time around? Not as well - he sends a forehand very long although Rafa pounded him into the mistake. We get Rafa’s first roar of the match after that. We then have some deuce shennanigans that look to have come to an end with a great drop shot from Zverev to bring up break point. He’s played that tactic to perfection this afternoon. And it created the opening - he breaks again with a backhand, his second best shot of the day. 

4.03pm BST
16:03

Second set: Nadal 6-1, 0-3 Zverev* (* denotes server)That reaction when he Zverev missed an easy volley to break Rafa shows why he is so highly rated. Most people would have shown frustration at passing up an opportunity against the greatest clay courter of all time but Sascha picked himself on and broke Rafa the next point. He took that confidence into this game and held to love.

Second set: *Nadal 6-1, 0-2 Zverev (* denotes server)Sascha asks the umpire to check the mark on the court after his shot is called out but it was clearly out. He has a little grumble too himself but for a man who has been run off the court he’s not exactly in Andy Murray-swearing-under-your-breath mode. I miss that swearing. That last service hold appears to have given Zverev some confidence and a terrible waft from Rafa brings up 15-40 and two break points. And ... wow. Sascha misses an excellent chance to break. He just needs to get the ball in with a volley at the net but sends it inches wide. Much to his credit, he tries again and after peppering Rafa with some big strokes he forces the Spaniard to send a forehand into the net and he’s broken! Well done, sir.

Second set: Nadal 6-1, 0-1 *Zverev (* denotes server)Zverev won only 27% of his points on first serve in the previous set. What does he have to do better in the second serve? Just about everything. But if he’s going to pick one then maybe start with his serve. What this though? An honest, good great shot from Zverev. He unleashes a riproarer from midcourt that travels so fast, Rafa barely sees it. There’s another zinger too: a disguised drop shot from the baseline that Rafa can only stand and admire. Sascha goes on to hold - an very impressive comeback and just what was needed to make this contest semi-competitive. That, amazingly, is his first hold of the match.

3.49pm BST
15:49

Zverev’s father winces in the stands after another loose shot. Rafa is so far ahead he is shaking his head even when he wins a points - unless it’s from a perfect shot. Zverev won the first game with ease but that appears to have only made Rafa mildly perturbed. And you don’t want to play Rafa mildly perturbed on clay. 

3.44pm BST
15:44

First set: Nadal 5-1 Zverev* (* denotes server)Zverev actually leads in a game! He rockets to a 40-0 lead after a couple of loose shots from Rafa, who is playing like a man with a comfortable lead and the sun on his back. Nadal then decides maybe he wants to win this game too and fires off a reflex volley at the net and then a crushing forehand and we’re at deuce. Rafa claims the game after reeling off six straight points, the final one is a little lucky coming off a net cord. Bu the Spaniard is in complete control of this match. Sorry drama/upset/Sascha fans.Updated

3.38pm BST
15:38

First set: *Nadal 4-1 Zverev (* denotes server)Sascha sends a nice forehand down the line to make it 30-15 and then Rafa dumps a serve into the net, which is the best spell of the match for him since the first game. After that things get a little crumbly again although Rafa is trying his best to help him out as his first serve malfunctions. Still Sascha’s second misplaces of the game - this time a long forehand with the court gaping open - gives Rafa the game. Zverev roars with frustration. This is all a little too easy for Rafa. 

3.33pm BST
15:33

First set: Nadal 3-1 Zverev* (* denotes server)Zverev prowls up to the net and a nice cushioned volley off a booming Nadal shot plops down inches from the net to take us to 15-0. A good response after two bad games from Sascha. There are a few ouches to come though: he doubles faults to gift Rafa two break points at 15-40. The serving glitches continue and Rafa seals the break with a big forehand at 30-40. Zverev started off the match so confidently but for some reason breaking the greatest clay courter of all time hasn’t done much for him and he has been tentative since.

3.27pm BST
15:27

First set: *Nadal 2-1 Zverev (* denotes server)Zverev has been enjoying the odd drop shot or 83 so far today. This time there’s too much drop and not enough shot and he puffs the ball into the net. He can’t handle a Rafa serve at 40-0 and Nadal holds very comfortably. Being broken in the first game obviously woke the Spaniard up.

3.24pm BST
15:24

First set: Nadal 1-1 Zverev* (* denotes server)Hands up who saw that coming in the first game then? As I can’t see anyone’s hands I’ll assume that’s no one. Having said that, Zverev can’t get on top of a looping forehand from Rafa - an achievement given that he’s 6ft 6in - and sends it long - that’s 0-30 to Nadal pretty quickly. A lovely drop shot later and Rafa breaks to love. We’re back on serve. 

3.20pm BST
15:20

First set: *Nadal 0-1 Zverev (* denotes server)And we’re off. Nadal gets things going with a big serve down the T but Zverev plays his way back into the rally and gets the first point of the match when Rafa sends a forehand wide. Zverev wins the second point too, making the old man scurry about with a series of drop shots, the last of which Rafa can’t get too. I know 31 isn’t old by the way. Unless you’re a cat or a mayfly. Zverev is making Rafa look a little creaky though and is soon 0-40 up! Against Rafa! On clay! A lovely approach at the net from Rafa brings it back to 30-40 but he can’t make it to deuce after he sends a forehand long and we have a break in the first game. Well, well, well ... well. Well.

3.11pm BST
15:11

Nadal and Zverev are out on court and warming up on a [Google “Rome weather”] fine afternoon in Rome. We shouldn’t be too long now.

3.01pm BST
15:01

Annabel Croft has told Sky Sports that Zverev’s chances against Rafa are ... not good:“When you watch Rafa Nadal do what he does and stand so far back but put enormous height on it, he kind of floats that ball back to the baseline and kind of neutralises the point from there on in and it would be much more difficult for Zverev to really dictate and control from that first strike after the serve.”

2.53pm BST
14:53

So here we are. A mere ten years, $90m in prize money and 69 career titles separate our two protagonists, Rafael Nadal and Alexander Zverev. But before you mark this one down as an easy win for Rafa, bear in mind that Zverev now has three Masters titles to his name at the age of just 21 and is in all probability a future world No1, once Federer retires at the age of 48.Rafa leads the head-to-head between these two 4-0 and won their only clay court meeting to date 6-1, 6-1 in Monte Carlo last year (he also won in straight sets when the two played each other in the Davis Cup last month).

2.36pm BST
14:36

The men’s doubles has just wrapped up so Nadal and Zverev should be on court fairly soon. In the meantime, Kevin Mitchell’s report on the women’s final from earlier is up and you can read it here:

13:25

Tom will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s how Rafa got on in the semi-final against Novak Djokovic yesterday:As the sun set on the beautiful Foro Italico, the replica alabaster statues mute witnesses to a glorious past and an uncertain future, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic edged in front of their absent friends, Andy Murray and Roger Federer, a week before the French Open.Federer, who was creaking a little on the hard courts of America after his astounding performance at the Australian Open, where he beat Marin Cilic to win his 20th slam title, decided to rest rather than suffer the rigours of clay in anticipation of another tilt at Wimbledon glory. But, as he approaches his 37th birthday, even his remarkable longevity must surely soon be stretched to the point of incredulity.Whether Murray, who turned 31 this week, even makes it to the line at the All England Club is up for speculation again, with further locker-room talk this weekend that his recovery from hip surgery in January remains worryingly stalled. His chances of returning on the grass of Rosmalen in the Netherlands the day after the French Open final are rated “poor” to “marginal”, according to sources.You can read the full report here:"
tennis,"Former world No 1’s latest French Open win suggests he is in comparable shape to Alexander Zverev and Grigor Dimitrov
Kevin Mitchell at Roland Garros

Wed 30 May 2018 21.04 BST


First published on Wed 30 May 2018 19.42 BST

On a day of rapidly swirling weather and fortunes, Novak Djokovic emerged from a second perfunctory win against a qualifier to stay in the conversation about who is good enough to stop Rafael Nadal winning his 11th French Open. He could get to the quarter‑finals; once there, he might even find another gear or two, which was his trademark in his pomp.Certainly the former champion is in shape comparable to that of younger contenders in Alexander Zverev, who took five sets to defeat the world No 60 Dusan Lajovic, and Grigor Dimitrov, who survived a tempestuous battle over four hours and 19 minutes against the American Jared Donaldson, who was reduced at one point to serving underarm.Djokovic, who beat Dutra Silva in the first round, had to work his way past the stubborn challenge of the 21‑year‑old Spanish qualifier Jaume Munar – ranked 155 in the world – after which he took time to reflect on the troubles of an absent friend, Andy Murray, with whom he has had long conversations.“I can only imagine how difficult it is for him to deal with the circumstances of injury,” he said. “That’s something that I can relate to. I have had quite a similar situation, although his injury takes more time, obviously. Hopefully we can see him playing on grass because that’s where, I guess, he wants to play.”He does, passionately. But it will not be easy. Nearly a year after he and Murray left Wimbledon, wounded losers who had driven each other to their physical limits in pursuit of the world No 1 ranking, the Serb is still standing – just, at 22 in the world – while the Scot’s prospects of fulfilling his commitment to end an 11-month sabbatical on the Dutch grass of Rosmalen the week after the French Open remain as clear as mud.The hip surgery in January that Murray hoped would restore him to full fitness has not clicked as well as he had originally thought, and there is uncertainty in the camp that he will make it to the line in the Netherlands – or even Wimbledon. If he misses the grasscourt season, he will have no ranking. If he were to make his comeback where he has won two of his three grand slam titles, he would be outside the top 150 for the first time since August 2005. Those are scary digits.Djokovic knows as much about struggle and injury as anyone on the Tour. His chronically painful right elbow kept him out for the rest of the year after Wimbledon and his comeback, which involved a recent “minor procedure”, has gone from a limping exit in Melbourne to a decent stroll in Rome last week, where he fought hard against Nadal, and gathered conviction in two wins here. On Friday he will need to lift his game against Roberto Bautista Agut, who saw off the Colombian qualfier Santiago Giraldo in just over two hours.“We have spoken directly – and indirectly, through his brother,” Djokovic said of Murray after a workmanlike 7-6 (1), 6-4, 6-4 victory against Munar on Court Suzanne-Lenglen. “We are part of the [ATP] player council, and he was on the conference call. We got to have a FaceTime, as well. He was very committed for like three, four hours. He’s got two children now, and life at home for sure is different, and I can understand [that].”As for his own up-and-down journey Djokovic, true to his enthusiasm for spiritual enlightenment over the past couple of years, tried to put it in a philosophical context. Asked if getting out of his current rut was harder than when he had a similar experience in 2008, he said: “It’s all a personal perspective, how you perceive things in life. It can be really tough and it can be really easy. Everything starts and ends with us in our minds. To sit here and talk about how tough it is, and you have people starving to death, for me there is no point in talking about that.“It’s just the way it is. As an athlete, I have to face these challenges, I will call them and, if I overcome them or not, it’s just a matter of work that I have put in, luck at times, and circumstances. That’s it. I have achieved so much in my life and I’m very, very grateful for that.”In light suited more to burglary than tennis, Cameron Norrie got out of jail against Lucas Pouille when he pulled a set back four minutes short of the tournament late-finish record of 9.56pm in 2010. He will resume on Thursday on the main court needing more heroics to overhaul the Frenchman’s 6-2, 6-4, 5-7 lead.It might not be beyond him. When he induced a final errant forehand from Pouille – who plays with contact lenses – he had effected an escape worthy of Houdini, and looked (to all those close enough to tell) as if he was up for the fight."

Johanna Konta’s assertion that Roland Garros holds no fears for her crumbled again like the clay beneath her feet when Yulia Putintseva put her to the sword in an hour and 24 minutes in the infamous Bullring on a cloyingly warm Sunday afternoon.A player battling to stay inside the top 100 dumped the British No 1 out of the French Open in the first round 6-4, 6-3, going away. For the fourth year in a row Konta has lost at the earliest stage to an opponent so far removed from her in the rankings – 71 places this time – it should have been a mismatch.Her next challenge was to retain her embedded sense of positivity in the face of the questions she anticipated about this tournament being a recurring hell. She did not disappoint.Batting away the suggestion that she had lost her way after a solid start, she said: “To be honest, [it] didn’t feel like a great match for me. I never quite found my rhythm.“I never quite found the way I wanted to play. Obviously there’s some of that to do with her. She played quite smart. Otherwise I think I just had a bad match.”That might have been the end of it had her inquisitors not pressed the obvious button: was this the clay tournament – unlike others, such as Rome – where she simply cannot get over the past?“I would like to think that we’re not heading to a self-fulfilling prophecy here,” she replied, still smiling.“But I don’t think it helps anyone’s preparation if the linger around it is like, ‘Oh, she hasn’t done well there before.’“I have felt success here before, through qualifying and coming through that. Actually, out of my four main-draw matches here this is probably the one I’m most disappointed [with] in terms of the level. This one is a bit harder to take in that way. But I would like to think that I’m still more in control of my tennis and my career than any sort of superstition coming into any tournament.”But did she not feel the external pressures – the media’s harping on about four straight losses here? “You guys can answer this for me, then. Let’s say for a few years your pieces of writing have just been crap every time when you come into Roland Garros. Right? Just crap.“And then your colleagues start to say, ‘You know, you really suck around that time.’ And that happens, you know, for a few years.“How would you guys digest that and would you feel any kind of lingering, ‘Oh, you know what? I want to prove these bastards wrong, but it’s just kind of lingering there.’? So it’s not something I would like to buy into – and I don’t think I do. However, you guys don’t make it easy.”Yet during the many tough moments of another disjointed and disappointing opener Konta surely had nightmare recollections of her first-round exits against the world No88, Denisa Allertova, in 2015, then Julia Goerges (57) in 2016 and Hsieh Su-wei (109) last year. That is a combined ranking of 347 in four years.Her own ranking of 22 looks unconvincing ahead of Wimbledon, where she left her best tennis a year ago. She will not let herself think so but this might well be curdling into a mental problem as much as anything to do with her tennis, fitness or attitude.“She doesn’t understand how she needs to play to win on clay,” the 2013 Wimbledon champion, Marion Bartoli, working here for ITV, observed, citing her sometimes reckless aggression. Konta said beforehand she was happy with her form on the surface and felt her preparation had gone well. Evidence to the contrary is mounting – although she admits she does not have a Plan B. Her goal is to go in with her best Plan A.She picked an apt place to test her resolve under pressure. The Bullring, the tournament’s third court, is coming down after this fortnight, leaving behind 28 years of fond memories, players invariably rising to the entreaties of hardcore fans packed into its tight, circular setting. The Roland Garros rebuild is scheduled for completion in 2020, by which time Konta would have hoped to work her way deeper into the tournament than she has managed in six visits.From the start there was no suggestion she would do to the solid Kazakh what she did to her last year in Rome, where a bagel wrapped it up in 109 minutes. Before that they had shared a clay court in Estoril and Konta won there in three sets.If there was no Paris curse, there was something in the air. Konta double-faulted five times, her second serve collapsed in the second set, winning her a mere three points from 10, and she finished with 32 unforced errors.From the start she struggled for rhythm and balance, which was skewing her timing, and, after an exchange of breaks in the eighth and ninth games, she netted a volley – her 22nd unforced error – to surrender the first set in 44 minutes.A quick break-back lifted her but Putintseva was ecstatic when she raced 15 metres to smash a winner for 3-1. Konta’s determined tormentor – aping her elaborate service action and celebrating every winner with a shrill exclamation of intent – aced to move within a game of reaching the second round.After an hour and a quarter Konta held through deuce to stay in the fight. But her serve, powered down and uncertain, looked beyond repair. A wild Konta thrash into the tramlines ended a seven-shot rally and the suffering. She heads for Wimbledon with plenty to prove: to herself and the bastards."

Kyle Edmund eased into this French Open on Tuesday with a three-set workout against Alex de Minaur that confirmed his status as one of his sport’s punishing cruiserweights, even if his opponent had the physical aura of a schoolboy.Napoleon, once of this parish, famously had a complex about his size, and bloodied a nose or two across Europe before the weight of his enemies crushed his ambitions. On day three of his second visit to Roland Garros, De Minaur – yet to reach 11st, standing a tad under 6ft and one of six teenagers in the draw – stuck doggedly to a muscular game that shone in bursts but ultimately played into Edmund’s unforgiving hands.While Edmund took less than two hours to win 6-2, 6-4, 6-3, the British No 1 acknowledged on court that it was not as easy as the numbers might suggest.De Minaur – the hustling young wildcard, who lives in Spain with his family and burst on to the scene in his native Australia in January – broke once from four chances but made inroads on his serve that stretched Edmund in the second set.“I played well, with intent,” Edmund said. “I knew the game style – me dictating the points, him making a lot of balls, forcing me to come up with the answers. I gave up too many points with errors in the second set, and double faults, but in the third set I got it back.“Conditions were a little heavier at the start but, when the sun came out at the end, the ball was pinging off the court a bit more. Throughout the match my concentration was generally very good. It’s something that doesn’t come overnight, and he’s the sort of opponent who is really up for the battle if he gets a sniff.”Edmund has a day to rest before taking on the world No 45, Marton Fucsovics, who defeated the Canadian Vasek Pospisil 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (5) on Court No 12. The 26-year-old Hungarian is coming off a win in the Geneva final against Peter Gojowczyk, who was beaten by Cameron Norrie on Monday.This was always going to be a tricky opening fixture for Edmund, even though he is protected from the tournament’s bigger beasts for a while by his 16th seeding. De Minaur, who hits and chases with a flourish, refused to back down at any stage, which was both his strength and his weakness.Most of his success sprang from machine-gun thrashes and determined running down of half-chances, but his potency dimmed as the lactic acid drowned out the adrenalin.He is Australia’s No 5 and oozes promise. He has the rare gift of being able to compartmentalise the point, ignoring the one just wasted and embracing those left. He showed that tunnel vision when he was 3-1 down in the first set yet pushed Edmund in every rally, getting back to 2-5 before the favourite served out just on the half‑hour.De Minaur, ahead in the serving cycle, moved through the early stages of the second set with renewed energy. He got break point in the second game but Edmund, unhappy with a line call, was fired up as he wrong-footed him with a rifled forehand on the way to a crucial hold.Edmund’s concentration dipped again and he found himself under pressure on his serve in the fourth game. But, as in the first set, he found the big guns when he needed them and levelled.His thin teenage foe struggled to maintain his buzzing tempo and Edmund broke for 3-2. They exchanged breaks in a knife-edge stretch illuminated by some brilliance on both sides of the net, before Edmund regathered his composure to serve out for a 2-0 lead – about the same time as Rafael Nadal was wrapping up a tense three‑setter in the tie-break against Simone Bolelli, held over from the previous evening.Edmund still had work to do but there was always going to be more weight left in his punch. And only after being broken in the third did De Minaur begin to fade, recognising perhaps that he was banging his fists up against a tank.As the sun finally shoved the clouds aside, Edmund held to love for 4-2 and despondency spread across De Minaur’s young features, even as he continued to let the blows flow, the final one too long, bringing the fight to a merciful conclusion."

The French Open announced on Monday it will not give Serena Williams a seeding for her return to grand slam tennis following maternity leave.“This year again, tournament officials will establish the list and ranking of the women’s seeds based on the WTA ranking,” the French Tennis Federation said in a statement. “Consequently, [the seeds] will reflect this week’s world ranking.”Williams, a three-time French Open champion, is expected to play in her first major since giving birth to her daughter in September. While Williams can enter Roland Garros under the WTA’s protected or “special” ranking rule, it’s up to grand slam organisers to give her a seed. While she was world No1 when she left the tour to give birth, Williams is currently ranked No453. Without a seeding, the 23-time grand slam singles champion risks facing top-ranked players in the early rounds.The WTA is considering a rule change to add protected seedings for highly ranked players returning from maternity leave but the earliest that could take effect is next year.Several of Williams’ biggest rivals believe she deserves a seeding. “I would like to see that [rule] change,” Maria Sharapova said at the Italian Open last week. “It’s such an incredible effort for a woman to come back from physically, emotionally. ... There’s just another whole dimension to the travel, to the experiences, to the emotions to the physicality of every single day.”Williams returned to the tour briefly in March after a 14-month absence. She was not seeded at tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami, and compiled two wins and two losses.Williams has recounted the difficulties she faced in childbirth, and a pulmonary embolism made it hard for her to breathe shortly after her daughter was born. But after a period of training, coach Patrick Mouratoglou last week told the WTA tour website that “Serena will play the French Open to win it.”The French Open draw will be made on Thursday, with the tournament starting on Sunday. "

Following her first Grand Slam win since becoming a mother, the American said: “I call it, like, my Wakanda-inspired catsuit,” referring to the fictional nation in the film Black Panther. Behind the jokes, there is also a more serious reason for the choice of skin-tight bodysuit outfit.

Right, they will not be coming back after that. Sharapova didn’t even start her game. Well, it was brief from me after a long day of fun for John. Thanks for your time and hopefully it will be great weather throughout tomorrow.

Nadal-Bolelli ends 6:4, 6:3, 0:3 for the day.Updated
at 6.49pm BST


6.45pm BST
18:45

The talks between players and umpires start once again. Nadal looks to be packing up while the fans boo. Looks like it’s all over, folks.Updated
at 7.17pm BST


6.43pm BST
18:43

Nadal and the umpire have a chat to see if Bolelli’s shot landed in. Sadly, for Nadal, the umpire stuck with his original call to say it was in. The Spaniard recovers to make it 30:30 as he channels his frustration in the rain. However, a clinical hit and a delayed wide call see Bolelli make it 3:0 in the third. Will they continue, though?

6.39pm BST
18:39

A superb rally was capped off by Bolelli to make it 30:30. He then goes one better with a cross-court forearm to earn game point. A backhand return on Nadal serves lands on the line and wins it for Bolelli. He’s 2-0 up in this set now.

6.35pm BST
18:35

The commentators are really doing their bit by announcing every time an umbrella is put away.

6.35pm BST
18:35

Despite the persistent rain, Bolelli gets through to take the opening game of the third set. Nadal looks the less happy on the two playing in these conditions.

6.31pm BST
18:31

They are clearing the lines, which is nice. The third set will now begin.

6.29pm BST
18:29

The Spaniard is now two sets to the good after a simple service game, overall. The umbrellas are up but the players are going to stay on. The umpire is chatting with Nadal about the conditions. 

6.26pm BST
18:26

Nadal is serving for the second set as he battles both Bolelli and the rain in Paris. Not sure he will be allowed to complete the victory tonight due to the rain. They’ve already stopped on Court 18.

6.24pm BST
18:24

Right, that’s me, John Brewin, done for today. Will Unwin will be taking over, hopefully for a five-setter, though rain stopped play looks the likelier outcome. Thanks for joining me. 

6.21pm BST
18:21

Nadal, at last, managed to break Bolelli and then serves out the next with a little more ease. It’s 4-3 in the second set. 

6.19pm BST
18:19

Still on Heather Watson’s serve, and she gets it back to deuce, another match point. Needed a good first serve, and this time Dodin hit too long. Great performance and result from Watson after a mixed start.Updated
at 6.29pm BST


6.16pm BST
18:16

Watson has a series of match points, but can’t see them out, and then has to face break points. A player with not many recent wins being put through the mill. 

6.14pm BST
18:14

Nadal, grim-faced, wins the next game on his serve but is 2-3 down. Word of warning, the rain is starting to fall. Not heavy enough yet for a delay, but worse is forecast later. 

6.08pm BST
18:08

Watson is 5-0 up, and Richard Gasquet is closing on victory over Seppi. He’s 5-2 up in the third set, having breezed to the first two. 

6.06pm BST
18:06

Bolelli’s forehand is causing real problems for Nadal, as his serve. Nadal struggling to break him, and after a succession of deuces, that’s 3-1 to the Italian in the second set. 

6.04pm BST
18:04

Heather Watson now 3-0 up and serving to make it 4-0. Really powerful display from her. Updated
at 6.11pm BST


5.59pm BST
17:59

Nadal - his purpose renewed? - was brutal in serving that game out to love. Now to break back.

5.58pm BST
17:58

Watson is now 2-0 up on Dodin in the second set. 

5.57pm BST
17:57

Bolelli holds his serve to make it 2-0, and Nadal, it has to be said, looks a little ruffled. His opponent has never won a singles title in his career but is lifting his level to somewhere that is uncomfortable for the champ. 

5.53pm BST
17:53

Watson served out the first set, to win 6-3. Plucky Britishness abounds. 

5.53pm BST
17:53

Bolelli breaks Nadal! That wasn’t the end of the Italian’s resistance, and he seized on a net cord to win the game. 0-1 in the second set. 

5.48pm BST
17:48

Heather Watson is 5-3 up now on Dodin in the first set after breaking her French opponent. 

5.46pm BST
17:46

Bollelli flops in his crucial service game and Nadal breaks to win the first set 6-4. That took over 40 minutes, and the Italian’s great work, and speed around the court, came to mean nothing. Nadal had a grimace, rather than a smile on his face. 

5.42pm BST
17:42

Heather Watson is currently at 3-3 in the first set with Dodin, having broken back. 

5.41pm BST
17:41

Nadal is being sent all around the court by Bolelli and not looking too happy with life so far. Shades of Djokovic before, perhaps, but there is looseness about the champion, who is having to chase down some big shots. That game goes to deuce, before Nadal, from mid-court, powers the ball where Bolelli will never reach. 5-4 in the first set. 

5.36pm BST
17:36

Bolelli again, is excellent on his service game, and levels it at 4-4. How long can he sustain this? And when might Nadal wake up?

Rafael Nadal speaks. “It was a tough match, of course, playing against him [Novak] is always a big challenge. He played well, and it’s always the same against him; when you go down a little bit in level, he is always there and you are in big trouble. I needed to play aggressive with my forehand, that’s when I felt I was a little more in control.The Spaniard will face Marin Cilic or Alexander Zverev, who meet later, on Sunday. “I need to be ready to play my best tomorrow. This victory today is a big confidence for me. This tournament has been very positive for me after last week in Madrid. To come back to a final, I’m very happy.”Thanks a lot for your company this afternoon. That was some match-up, a riveting game between two heavyweights, teeming with some brilliant tennis. Kevin Mitchell’s report from Rome will appear below shortly:Updated

The first evaded him but a second match point was too good to turn down for Nadal, who plays a punishing forehand down the line. Victory is his, in another classic meeting between two titans of tennis. Nadal is into the Italian Open final, and he has a chance of his eighth title in Rome.

16:10

Second set: Nadal* 7-6, 5-3 Djokovic (*denotes server): Nadal, unusually, plays a couple of wasteful shots, with Djokovic only too happy to gobble them up. But a revved up Nadal fights back with a thumping forehand in a rally of sublime shot-making to nip into a 40-30 lead. And then – how about this? A double fault by Nadal gifts Djokovic back in at deuce. Nadal nudges himself in front but, of course, the Serb comes up with one of those roaring forehands to peg Nadal back. A third deuce comes and goes for Djokovic and, after 10 minutes, Nadal eventually clinches it. Wow.

3.58pm BST
15:58

Second set: Nadal 7-6, 4-3 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Djokovic is determined not to roll over but he must feel like it at times. Nadal plays a storming backhand, enough to get the seal of approval from the Serb, via a thumbs-up. But Djokovic has no plans of going anywhere just yet.

3.55pm BST
15:55

Second set: Nadal* 7-6, 4-2 Djokovic (*denotes server): Nadal is proving a real monster out there, an omnipotent, unforgiving force out on centrale. He now races into 40-0 to restore his two-game lead. 

3.51pm BST
15:51

Second set: Nadal 7-6, 3-2 Djokovic* (*denotes server): A couple of big forehands earn Djokovic a lifeline in a game in which he looked really up against it. He almost surrenders it too but Nadal’s lob runs too long, beyond the baseline and Djokovic has a chance.

3.46pm BST
15:46

Second set: Nadal* 7-6, 3-1 Djokovic (*denotes server): Nadal starts as he means to go on, with a thumping smash to take 15-0. His next serve is too hot for Djokovic to handle but, while his third is rasping, the Serb digs deep to produce a stunning backhand return. He earned that, but moved level at 30-30 after Nadal’s wild forehand – his first miscue of the set. But, these are just bumps in the road. Nadal takes it. 

3.41pm BST

Second set: Nadal 7-6, 2-1 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Nadal plays a magnificent, dipping volley over the net to tee up the first of three break points. And when Djokovic strikes long, Nadal turns the screw to clinch it.

15:38

Second set: Nadal* 7-6, 1-1 Djokovic (*denotes server): A flurry of gorgeous shots, shifting Djokovic from one side of the court to another, see Nadal move into the distance. He plays a wonderful searching backhand and that’s sufficient to pull level. Updated

3.34pm BST
15:34

Second set: Nadal 7-6, 0-1 Djokovic* (*denotes server): After an exceptional tie-break of tennis, Djokovic’s first serve is horribly wide. He was livid after failing to get over the line in the first set, and presumably still seething. Nevertheless, he skips into a 0-40 lead with his third ace of the afternoon. Nadal can’t return his final serve and that, at least, was easy.

First set: Nadal 6-6 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Nadal initally lures Djokovic in to the net as he fights to stay in it to earn 15-0. Djokovic then responds with a galling volley with Nadal still recovering. The Spaniard seems to run of steam with a flat forehand and Djokovic rises once more. His subsequent forehand down the line brings him to 15-40 before sealing a sublime game with a neat backhand. When the pressure was on, he made it look easy. We go to a tie-break, then.

First set: Nadal 5-5 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Djokovic hammers his first forehand into the tennis equivalent of Row Z. He’s not happy about that but takes the second point, a calm volley to move to 15-15. A sweet backhand then puts Nadal in trouble, in turn wrong-footing the Spaniard. Three games in a row for the Serb.

3.01pm BST
15:01

First set: Nadal* 5-4 Djokovic (*denotes server): Nadal has Djokovic moving and shaking to get to 15-0 and an error from the Spaniard sees him welly a shot into the net. A thunderous rally then ends with Djokovic getting lucky after a bruising point, with his volley bumbling off the net and on to the clay. And, this time, Djokovic breaks Nadal’s serve.

2.47pm BST
14:47

First set: Nadal 4-2 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Nadal strokes a beautiful forehand up the line and then Djokovic’s attempt to cut one short is flawed as it ripples the net. Just as Nadal looks to seize control at 30-0, Djokovic comes up trumps with a bending, dipping forehand and then another stunning winner, an arcing backhand. His next forehand is wide but he snatches a brilliant rally to pull him to deuce; two geniuses are at work. But, eventually, Nadal punishes Djokovic’s long shot to take it. 

2.38pm BST
14:38

First set: Nadal* 3-2 Djokovic (*denotes server): It’s a little windy out on centrale, with Djokovic’s flailing back hand running long. Nadal strides into a 40-15 lead, with a thirsty forehand teeing up game-point. A series of sharp shots, after his serve was found to be in by Djokovic, clinches it. A classy touch by Djokovic, very sportsmanlike, to point out Nadal’s first serve was, in fact, not a fault. Updated

First set: Nadal 2-2 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Djokovic’s looping forehand plays into Nadal’s hands, but his survival instincts are enough to eke into a 0-30 lead. His delightful backhand drop shot wraps up the game with a degree of swagger. That was simply exquisite. Level-pegging. Updated

First set: Nadal 1-1 Djokovic* (*denotes server): A wild Nadal forehand gifts Djokovic a 0-15 lead. From there the Serb powers to 0-40, with a cute volley at the net. A rasping, swooning ace takes the game. Lovely. 

2.23pm BST
14:23

First set: Nadal* 1-0 Djokovic (*denotes server): Nadal’s first serve is straight into the net and his subsequent forehand long. Then Djokovic overpowers his return to take it to 15-15. Djokovic seems to have settled the quicker, with a striking forehand down the line and then Nadal can only find the net. Djokovic looks in the mood, his stamina strong in the rally but he squanders two break points. Nadal slams a backhand over to gain advantage and then his serve proves too strong. “Novak will have to summon up the spirits of the Gladiators to have a chance against Maximus Nadal Emperor of Clay,” tweets John McEnerney. “A three-setter would be great but Novak mightn’t have too much left in the tank after the last round, Rafa to march on to the final.”

Pre-match reading, courtesy of Kevin Mitchell in Italy:It seems odd that Rafael Nadal’s domination on clay in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Paris has not been so evident in Rome, where he has a mere seven titles and last appeared in the semi-finals four years ago. Still, he will hardly complain and he will be mightily happy if he wins on Sunday as it will haul him back to No 1 in the world above the absent Roger Federer.The man he defeated 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 on Friday to reach the semi‑finals, Fabio Fognini, will afford the Spaniard little sympathy if he falls short. This was Fognini’s first quarter-final at his home tournament at the 13th attempt and he must have thought he could go further, or even all the way, when he came from 4-1 down in the first set to send Roman tennis fans into a frenzy on a perfect summer’s day.

A royal meeting, a 51st between the pair, on centre court between two tennis heavyweights – Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. The Spanish world No 2 overcame Fabio Fognini to reach the last four in Rome, with Djokovic fighting from a set down to beat Kei Nishikori in a marathon quarter-final win en route to here. This match is the first duel between the two since Nadal got the better of Djokovic in Madrid last summer. “He is one of the best in history, no doubt,” Nadal said of the former world No 1. “I am not like those [players] who say ‘yes, I want to measure myself with him’. To be honest, I prefer not to play against him.” The final takes place on Sunday, against the winner of Marin Cilic’s tie with the defending champion, Alexander Zverev.Play begins: circa 2pm (BST)Updated

Johanna Konta looks to be loosening up, on and off court, as she heads for the French Open where, despite her talent and ambition, she has gone out in the first round three visits in a row.In the last two of those campaigns she has left Rome for Paris in decent form, and on Wednesday she completed a hat-trick of year-on-year bagels against opponents in what used to be called the Italian Open, defeating the most inventive – if fragile – of players on her tour, Hsieh Su-wei, 6-0, 6-4 in an hour and five minutes.It was a cleansing of the spirit for Konta, who lost to Hsieh, a doubles artist par excellence but de-fanged considerably in singles, in the first round at Roland Garros a year ago.However, because tennis is such a revolving door of glory and disappointment, Konta’s opponent in the third round on Thursday is Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 French champion, who advanced the previous day by beating Shuai Zhang in two sets.“She backed her French Open win up significantly the following months,” Konta said of the 20-year-old Latvian. “She made the quarters of Wimbledon, she made Singapore and she has already made the final of Miami this year. She is a big ball striker, so I know I am definitely going to have to work hard at staying strong in some of the points.”She had no problem doing that against the feathered touches of Hsieh but still had to work to unlock the peculiar riddles the Taiwan wizard poses. Her forehand buzzed again but, although she is satisfied with her hitting on both wings, a couple of backhands looked tentative, particularly towards the end when she was striving for a quick finish.“It’s never a straightforward match against her,” Konta said. “The first set was quite quick [19 minutes] but I was fully prepared to play as long as needed. Overall, I’m happy with the way I was playing. I played the way I wanted to play. I was looking to keep her moving forward, trying to take that time away from her, and give her as little opportunity as possible to be as creative as she is.“I learn from each match I play against every opponent. Yes, she’s definitely unique, very talented and a crafty player. I think I had already improved a lot from when I played her at the French, to when I played her at Wimbledon.”Nevertheless, she probably could do without playing her again too soon. Konta has had a cold all week but she is not one to complain. She loves Rome and has visited twice on holidays, indulging her love of food. As she was winding up, Novak Djokovic, looking as if he could do with a hearty meal, interrupted his post-match stroll to the locker-room to ask Konta, “Can I experience your cooking one day?”Konta, who had been elaborating on her love of the kitchen and finding new recipes, replied: “To be fair, it’s my parents and my boyfriend who say it’s good. They are a bit biased but I’ll bring stuff in.”Both winners on day three, which finally let the sun through, they agreed the Konta feast will take place at Wimbledon. Djokovic, famously particular about his diet, suggested anything “gluten-free, dairy-free or sugar-free”. She paused, smiled and said: “I’ll make it work.”It’s not often players get to relax on either tour, given the helter-skelter schedule and the grinding round of media and commercial commitments they have to squeeze in between matches and training. Djokovic – who cannot have used up many calories in the hour and 17 minutes it took him to beat the qualifier Nikoloz Basilashvili – looked his old relaxed self. Perhaps, his stuttering comeback will take off soon.Konta, meanwhile, will work on her cooking. “Right now I’m basically going through the monthly Waitrose magazine recipes, and they’re great.”And she is nowhere near as pernickety as Djokovic. “I’m fortunate in that I don’t have any allergies or intolerances. I look to make good choices and right choices for my body. What you put in you get out.”Over the years, she has put plenty in. At 22 in the world after a long spell in the top 10, she is looking to take some more out this summer, starting with Ostapenko in the third round. She won their only encounter, in three sets on the grass of Eastbourne last year. A breakthrough into the fourth round would keep Konta on track for more tough challenges in her half of the draw, which still includes the world No 1, Simona Halep, the Americans Sloane Stephens and Madison Keys, as well as the mercurial Caroline Garcia.Kyle Edmund made it a third-round double for Britain’s best on the men’s and women’s tours when he beat Lucas Pouille 6-2, 7-6 (3) in an hour and 34 minutes under lights on Court Pietrangeli."
tennis,"The British No 1 is unfazed by the pressure of his strong position inside the top-16 seedings bubble and welcomes the test of his dangerous first-round opponent Alex de Minaur

Kyle Edmund, simultaneously handling hay fever and raised expectations, rubs his eyes occasionally while he surveys the opportunities opening up for him at Roland Garros over the next fortnight in the most open major for several years.He is inside the protective top-16 bubble in the seedings for the first time and, in the continued absence of Andy Murray, hardly needs reminding that a nation expects – perhaps too much. But it does not seem to faze him. He is the most sanguine of customers.While Edmund is up for it – if only he can shake the pollen from his nostrils – he is quick to identify his first opponent, the vibrant young Australian wildcard, Alex de Minaur, as a challenge every bit as dangerous as some he hopes to encounter deeper in the draw.After reaching the semi-finals at the Australian Open the British No 1 has navigated a steeper climb in the rankings and in his personal ambitions. He might not put it in so many words, but winning here with the field in unfamiliar disarray would represent an obvious high-point in his young career, even if a rematch with his Melbourne conqueror, Marin Cilic, in the fourth round might be a more realistic target.“Guess there was expectation from the outside,” he says of his post-Australian development, in which he reached his first Tour final and has risen to No 17 in the world.“I always have expectations on myself to do well but, when you are going up the rankings and you start to play guys more often a lower rank than you, it’s just the way it works.”To parrot a truism, to be the best, you have to beat the best. Edmund says the gap between the top 10 and the others still exists but the lines are blurred. “You have to do more on the court against them. Consistently through the match you have to be on it. Sometimes you can lose to either because you can’t be on it like a machine every time. There are [smaller] margins to beat those [top 10] guys and maybe slightly [bigger] margins to beat the other guys.”Echoing the sentiments of Johanna Konta about the women’s draw at majors, he adds: “A lot of players can beat players lower-ranked or higher-ranked these days. Sometimes it’s not too much of a surprise when that happens. The tour is pretty tough, not a lot of margins. The reason the guys are at the top is they consistently perform better each day in matches. But even the top guys, I’m pretty sure they know they have to be on it a lot of the time – and they are very good at doing that.”In this second phase of his career, Edmund says he has not changed his mindset or his preparation, but he knows it will never be the same for him as when learning his trade in less stressful circumstances against players some way removed from Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and his closer rival, the world No 3 Alexander Zverev, with whom he shared a fierce struggle in Rome last week.“He’s probably playing the best tennis of his life,” Edmund said of the tall, free-flowing German. “It was definitely a match where I can look and see where I’m at. Other matches as well: David Goffin, No 10 in the world – I was playing well against him [in Madrid two weeks ago]. Or even Djokovic [whom he also beat in the Spanish capital]. Other guys, lower-ranked, see how you play against them.”As for De Minaur, he says: “I practised with him probably three or four times before I played with him in Estoril [winning 6-2, 7-5], so I knew what to expect there. He has lots of energy and runs down a huge amount of balls. He’s the type of guy who makes you win your points. He’s not going to give them to you cheaply.“You’re going to be in [a lot of] rallies. He’s not a guy that powers you off the court or a big server, but he certainly makes you earn the points. In one way, it’s nice to know what you’re going to get. But it’s one thing knowing it and another executing the game plan.”Late on Friday, Nadal learned he would begin the defence of his title against the 32-year-old Italian Simone Bolelli, a lucky loser drafted in to cover the late withdrawal of Alexandr Dolgopolov. Bolelli, ranked 130 in the world, has lost all of his five matches against the Spaniard, most recently in Madrid two years ago. Also called up is Ruben Bemelmans, in for Lu Yen-hsun against Yuki Bhambri, in the same quarter of the draw."

Bernard Tomic has turned on himself once again in a sour aftermath to his first-round French Open exit at Roland Garros. The Australian shot down suggestions he was only playing tennis for money as he cut not so much a dejected but petulant figure following his 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 loss to Argentine battler Marco Trungelliti.While Trungelliti rejoiced in penning the feelgood story of the tournament, having driven 10 hours from Barcelona to Paris on the eve of the match just to play as a lucky loser from qualifying, Tomic delivered another PR disaster in a sulky post-match press conference.The 25-year-old offered up a total of 64 words in response to 10 questions from an international tennis media eager to gain an insight into the mind of one of the sport’s most talented stars and biggest enigmas.“Yeah, I guess I was OK,” Tomic said when asked if his gruelling run of seven wins on European clay had taken a toll on him physically in the two-hour, 54-minute defeat. “Yeah, we’ll see. We’ll see what’s next,” when asked if he could take renewed confidence into his preferred grass-court season.Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day“It is what it is. That’s all I can say,” when quizzed about his attire, in a veiled reference to the former Wimbledon quarter-finalist losing sponsorships following his claim that he was “a little bit bored” during his first-round defeat at the All England Club last year.When grilled about his desire, Tomic – who has readily admitted he has not given 100% in plenty of matches throughout his turbulent career – was even more curt. “Next question,” he said when asked “are you in this primarily for financial reasons or do you want to do other things?”The bitter postscript was a sad finale to what had been a promising campaign for the one-time world No 17. Having recorded a career-best seven straight victories on clay over the past three weeks, after being winless since January, Tomic could have departed Paris with optimism – and dignity.Instead, his 64 words left most asking the $64m question: where next for the two-time former grand slam junior champion? “I go home to Monaco and that’s it,” was Tomic’s plan, shedding no light on his grass-court plans.The one-time Wimbledon quarter-finalist will take with him 40,000 euros ($62,000) and a projected rankings rise of 28 spots to No 178 in the world.But whatever positives Tomic takes away from Paris remain to be seen – because “it was solid, it was good” was all the troubled star would offer up."

Rafael Nadal has lost his world No 1 ranking after suffering a quarter-final defeat by Austria’s Dominic Thiem at the Madrid Masters. Thiem, who lost to Nadal in the Monte Carlo quarter-finals last month, was the last player to beat the Spaniard on clay – at last year’s Rome Masters – and he prevailed in the Spanish capital on Friday, winning 7-5, 6-3.Nadal had set a record of winning 50 consecutive sets on a single surface by beating the Argentinian Diego Schwartzman on Thursday but he was undone by Thiem, who broke the 31-year-old’s serve five times before sealing victory with a powerful cross-court winner in just under two hours. The 24-year-old, seeded fifth, will now face the South African Kevin Anderson in the semi-finals on Saturday. “I haven’t been good enough today,” Nadal said. “Some days you don’t play as good as you would like to play. Also when that happens it’s because your opponent is doing really well.”Roger Federer, who is sitting out the clay-court season, will return to world No 1 on Monday but Nadal could regain top spot with a win at the Rome Masters, which begins on Sunday.Kyle Edmund’s run at the Madrid Open also came to an end at the quarter-final stage after he was beaten by Canada’s Denis Shapovalov.The British No1 saved a match point at the end of a feisty second set which also involved an incident in which he was distracted by a spectator. But Edmund could not hold off his 19-year-old opponent who broke early in the third and served well to triumph 7-5, 6-7, 6-4.Edmund will take heart from his week, though, especially his memorable win over Novak Djokovic in the earlier rounds.On the women’s side of the draw, Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands continued her sparkling week, securing a place in the final with an emphatic 6-2, 6-2 victory over France’s Caroline Garcia.The unseeded world No 20 blasted her way past Garcia, the seventh seed, in just over an hour, breaking serve four times and never surrendering a break point to move within sight of her second singles title of the year.The 26-year-old had taken some big scalps already in Madrid, defeating Maria Sharapova in the quarter-finals on Thursday, the day after knocking out the world No 2 and Australian Open champion, Caroline Wozniacki.“I’m really happy with the way I played. I think it was maybe not great tennis, what people want to see with a lot of winners, but Caroline is a great player,” Bertens said. “Garcia likes when the ball comes from the hip so I was just trying to play as many different balls as I could. I think I did it pretty well.”“She played very well, she used the high ball very well,” said Garcia, of Bertens. “I couldn’t do anything about it.“Of course, I’m frustrated. My performance today was not great. But she had a game plan and it worked well.”Bertens will face a tough examination in Saturday’s final against Petra Kvitova after she beat her Czech compatriot Karolina Pliskova 7-6, 6-3 in Friday’s second semi-final. The victory was Kvitova’s 10th in succession and moves her one step closer to a second successive title after her triumph at last week’s Prague Open. "

Ostapenko played poorly today, much as she has done for the past year. Her approach is great when it works, but she needs a fallback for when it doesn’t because otherwise, against a half-decent player she’s cooked. 

6.26pm BST
18:26

THE DEFENDING CHAMPION IS OUT! FOR JUST THE SECOND TIME IN THE OPEN ERA, IN THE VERY FIRST ROUND! 

6.26pm BST
18:26

Ostapenko plays the first well, hammering away from the back and forcing Kozlova to hit long. 

6.25pm BST
18:25

Ostapenko is now just getting her second serve into play, and Kozlova steps around her backhand to punish a return for 15-all and quicksmart it’s 15-40 ... two matchpoints for Kozlova! 

6.23pm BST
18:23

Kozlova suddenly starts playing and a wild thwack from Ostapenko sees her facing three game points. She looks at her mum and coach, but they’re not going to help her ... so Kozlova does, gifting two points. Dearie me. But here comes Kozlova again, a succession of booming backhands taking her within a game. Is the defending champ on her way hame? 

6.18pm BST
18:18

15-30 down, Ostapenko starts struggling with her toss and the inevitable double fault doth ensue; two break points Kozlova. The first is saved and then a backhand inside-outer is far too good; well in Ostapenko, who then nets unnecessarily and double faults again for the third time in the game. Surely Kozlova can bring it home from here? Ostapenko 5-7 3-4 Kozlova.

6.14pm BST
18:14

What am I talking about. Ostapenko is hard, and she breaks back immediately - there’ve been only two holds in the ladt ten games. 

6.09pm BST
18:09

Haase finally took that first set off Goffin 6-4; - he failed when serving for it in a marathon game but then broke - and he leads 1-0 on serve in the second. Updated
at 6.10pm BST


6.09pm BST
18:09

This might go quickly now! A double fault, Ostapenko’s tenth of the match, means that all Kozlova needs to do it hold serve thrice and she’s into round 2!

6.07pm BST
18:07

Ostapenko plays a nice approach when 40-30 down, skating in to finish it off, only to snatch at her clear-up and stick it into the net. 2-2. 

6.03pm BST
18:03

But Ostapenko might just join her on that list - she’s broken-back to love, unable to get a rhythm going. 

6.02pm BST
18:02

Ostapenko is starting her way back, breaking for 2-0. In the open era, Anastasia Myskina is the only champion to go out in the first round the following year - that was in 2004 and 2005. Updated
at 6.02pm BST


5.57pm BST
17:57

On Chatrier we’re back underway, and Ostapenko holds to 15. Kozlova doesn’t look comfy yet, lifting her foot gingerly, but presumably she’ll sort it in the next game or so. 

5.53pm BST
17:53

Robin Haase is serving for the set against David Goffin, seeded 8...

5.50pm BST
17:50

Kozlova has a minging blister on her heel, at which the trainer is looking. 

5.49pm BST
17:49

Kozlova manages to serve out, taking the first set 7-5. Can Ostapenko, the defending champion, rouse herself to get back into the match?Updated
at 6.25pm BST


5.48pm BST
17:48

Berankis nets a backhand and that’s that for him. Zverev looks in fantastic touch - his play was so dominant, and one hour nine minutes is remarkably little time to finish a three-set match. Zverev meets Vesely or Lajovic next, but the test for him will likely come next week when we’ll see if he’s got the game and the head to win under pressure. 

5.44pm BST
17:44

Bernakis has got to two games in a set for the first time, but Zverev has five so he must hold to stay in the match. 

5.43pm BST
17:43

Oh look, Kozlova has broken again ... can she secure the set this time? 

5.40pm BST
17:40

Ostapenko has broken back for 5-5 and is beginning to display patience. 

5.39pm BST
17:39

I hope Berankis’ locker-room nickname is BA. 

5.38pm BST
17:38

Obviously Zverev now leads 4-1. Can he find a way to beat Nadal? It’s unfair to suffix this with that, but that’s what it’s about for him really - well sort of. He needs to get there first, which would constitute an achievement, but his time has come. 

5.35pm BST
17:35

Lot of good that break-back did Ostapenko. She tamely cedes her serve and Kozlova has the ball on her racket as she seeks to win the set. 

5.34pm BST
17:34

On Court 2, Goffin and Haase have started; they’re two games apiece. 

5.33pm BST
17:33

Elsewhere, Zverev leads Berankis 2-1 in third, but they’re on serve. 

5.32pm BST
17:32

Ostapenko goes to the well and forces Kozlova into a long, hard one before seizing on a net cord and punishing a backhand wrongfooter. 4-4 in the first. 

5.24pm BST
17:24

Ostapenko has never beaten Kozlova, apparently - though they’ve only played twice. The thing with her is that she hits it so hard and takes so many risks, if it’s not happening for her she can lose to anyone. Kolova leads 4-3 with a break. 

5.22pm BST
17:22

And there we go: Zverev takes the second set 6-1, and will shortly be back lounging. 

5.17pm BST
17:17

Zverev is looking absolutely brilliant here, 5-1 up in the second set, and they’ve only been playing 41 minutes! Berankis isn’t even playing badly, there’s just nowt he can do. 

5.14pm BST
17:14

Kuzmova beat Schiavone 7-6 7-6 - she plays Svitolina next in what should be a cracker. 

5.12pm BST
17:12

The ageless Verdasco now leads Nishioka by two sets to one, but is a break down in the fourth. 

5.11pm BST
17:11

What a joy Ostapenko was last year, embracing power and risk to shock the world ... age 19. She’s seeded 5 this time, but if she starts hitting it as she did, no one will fancy meeting her. 

5.10pm BST
17:10

On Chatrier, last year’s surprise champions, Jelena Ostapenko, has started her title defence. She trails 2-3 and is a break down against Kateryna Kozlova.

On Lenglen, Zverev has taken the first set 6-1. Berankis is not offering him much. 

5.02pm BST
17:02

Konta will be happy to get back in the changing room and off to a grass court. Can she pick up some confidence before Wimbledon? 

5.00pm BST
17:00

Putintseva stretches really well at the net to bring up matchpoint and confirms it in short order when Konta slashes a backhand wide. She did not look at all comfy out there, shorn of rhythm and confidence, and Putintseva quickly realised that if she could keep the ball in play, that’d be enough. She plays Brady or Hesse next.

4.56pm BST
16:56

Elsewhere, Zverev leads Berankis 4-1. 

4.55pm BST
16:55

Konta just doesn’t look like she’s sussed clay, up for 31 unforceds in going 0-15 down. She can produce decent points - she does with a serve out wide and a drive-volley that gets her 30-all - but there’s no consistency. Still, she hangs in there and Putitnseva will have to serve for it. 

4.50pm BST
16:50

...easy hold for Putintseva. She’s a game away from dismissing the numer 22 seed. 

4.47pm BST
16:47

Konta wins her first service game in time for 2-4. Huge few points coming up...

4.43pm BST
16:43

Putintseva is on one and Konta gives her 4-1 with a wafty forehand that she almost seems to give up on as she hits it. 

4.41pm BST
16:41

Zverev breaks Berankis at the first opportunity and leads 2-0. 

4.40pm BST
16:40

Putintseva is so quick around the court, and after consolidating, she races in when Konta mishits a smash and cleans it up for 3-1, exhorting the crowd in the aftermath. This match is nearly over; Konta has been broken four times on the spin. 

4.36pm BST
16:36

Putitnseva breaks the run of breaks with a comfy hold. Konta 4-6 1-2 Putintseva ... and i think Putitnseva is rustling here, bouncing the ball like Konta does before serving. Snigger. Updated
at 5.28pm BST


4.32pm BST
16:32

Konta is playing much better now, and seeking to consolidate, a lovely pick-up gets her 30-30. But she can’t sustain her level and loses consecutive points, Putitnseva hitting a return from out wide that isn’t great but is good enough. That’s five breaks in row. 

4.28pm BST
16:28

Alexander Zverev appears to have blowdried his curtains. We’ve all been there. 

4.27pm BST
16:27

Brilliant from Konta, who forces breakpoints in fury at herself and seizes the third with an almighty forehand hit from shoulder-height. 1-0 her in the second set. Updated

Kuzmova has taken the first set against Schivaone - making her last appearance in Paris - on the breaker.

4.18pm BST
16:18

Konta can’t find her rhythm, and is quickly 0-40 down and fighting to stay in the set. But she’s good at that and wins two point to give herself a shot, then opens the court with a booming forehand ... only to net from in front of it! Dearie me. Konta 4-6 Putintseva.

Will Venus be back next term? I hope so, but who knows.

Wang gets to 30-0 but Venus connects with a forehand to close the gap and then finds a lovely angle to plant another on the sideline. Will Wang get nervous? 

4.13pm BST
16:13

Putintseva holds and gets to 0-30 ... what does Konta have for her? A kicking serve that’s too much for the 5’3 Russian for starters, but then Konta goes long on the forehand ... only to haul herself to deuce in short order! She then can’t make game from advantage thanks to her 19th unforced error so far - that is ridiculous - and when she rushes the net, breakpoint

The clay of Roland Garros is supposed to be mysterious, an ochre deathbed for the innocent and the ill-prepared. However, at least two players at this French Open have surprisingly divergent views on it.Naomi Osaka, one of the sport’s unusual thinkers, says it is not clay at all – “not clay-clay” anyway, as she put it after bundling Zarina Dyas out in the second round on Wednesday.Asked to explain, the 20-year-old Japanese star with the American twang said: “I just focus more on the tennis part rather than making up excuses of what the surface is and how my play style isn’t suited for it, or whatever.”Her game was good enough to beat the world No 51, 6-4, 7-5. Seeded here for the first time, Osaka does not lack for confidence.As for her dismissal of the dirt at her feet, Rafael Nadal disagrees. The Spaniard, who has a degree in clay, surprised everyone when he said of his favourite killing ground: “The court is more slippery than usual. I slid a lot when I started off or when I moved to another side. It was quite complicated.“There are many more grey zones or white zones than other years, because there are little pebbles underneath. That’s [because] you don’t have the proper grip on the court.”So, still a mystery, then.Johanna Konta, who insisted she had no fear of the Parisian clay after a fourth quick singles exit here, blew a 4-2 lead in the third set of her doubles match alongside Alison Riske, as Annabel Medina Garrigues and Arantxa Parra Santonja won 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (3) in two hours and 22 minutes.Konta’s first-round conqueror, Yulia Putintseva, went through by defeating the American Jennifer Brady, 6-4, 6-3. Next up for her is Barbora Strycova, who got past Ekaterina Makarova in two sets.Petra Kvitova, who was a game away from going home in her first-round match against the unseeded Verónica Cepede Royg, seems to be her old self again. The eighth seed defeated Lara Arruabarrena 6-0, 6-4 in 68 minutes. She is in the half of the draw that has already lost the defending champion Jelena Ostapenko and Venus Williams. Anett Kontaveit, who looked good in defeating the Romanian qualifier Alexandra Dulgheru, 7-5, 6-2, should provide another stiff test.Heather Watson, who is still in singles, won her doubles match with Tatjana Maria against the French pair Manon Arcangioli and Shérazad Reix, 6-4, 6-4."

Argentina’s Nicolas Kicker has been found guilty of match-fixing and “other offences”, the Tennis Integrity Unit has announced.Kicker, ranked 84 in the world, has yet to be punished but has been suspended from professional tennis after the findings of an independent anti-corruption hearing officer.The 25-year-old faces sanctions in connection with two ATP Challenger matches he played in during separate tournaments in 2015.“Argentinian tennis player Nicolas Kicker has been found guilty of match-fixing and other offences under the Tennis Anti-Corruption Program,” read a TIU statement.“Mr Kicker, 25, was found guilty of contriving the outcome of a match at the ATP Challenger tournament in Padova, Italy, in June 2015 and a match at the ATP Challenger tournament in Baranquilla, Colombia, in September 2015.“He was also found guilty of failing to report a corrupt approach and of not co-operating with a TIU investigation into the allegations made against him.”Independent anti-corruption officer Jane Mulcahy QC considered the case at a hearing in Miami on March 20 following an investigation and details of his sanctions will be made public at a later date, the TIU said.“Until that time Mr Kicker will not be granted credentials to enter or compete in any professional tennis event sanctioned by the governing bodies of tennis,” the statement added. Rafael Nadal, reaching for his 11th French Open title, plays the dangerous but erratic Ukrainian Alexandr Dolgopolov first-up in the 117th championship, while Britain’s main hope, Kyle Edmund, inside the safety net of the top 16 for the first time, has a tricky opener against the young Australian wildcard Alex de Minaur.If Edmund, who got to the third round last year, is to forge on to a semi-final against the defending champion, he might have to cope with the challenges of Marin Cilic, who beat him in the Australian semi-finals, Fabio Fognini or the wounded Juan Martin del Potro.Huge interest was trained on 36-year-old Serena Williams, returning to grand slam tennis nearly a year and a half after winning the 2017 Australian Open while seven weeks pregnant. Unseeded – controversially in the eyes of many – the 23-slam American plays Kristyna Pliskova, in the same quarter as the reigning Wimbledon title-holder, Garbiñe Muguruza, who plays former French champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, Maria Sharapova (drawn against a qualifier) and her opponent’s sister, Karolina, the sixth seed. Williams and Sharapova could meet in the fourth round.Jo Konta, who found some form in Rome last week, meets the 23-year-old Russian Yulia Putintseva, ranked 93 in the world, for the first time. Venus Williams is in their quarter, along with the defending champion, Jelena Ostapenko, who plays Kateryna Kozlova.Heather Watson, ranked 86 in the world and struggling, plays France’s Oceane Dodin in the same quarter as the world No 1 Simona Halep, who starts against Alison Riske.Britain’s Cameron Norrie, who beat John Isner to reach the Lyons semis on Thursday, plays the German Peter Gojowczyk, and has former French champion Stan Wawrinka and No 2 Alexander Zverev blocking his way in the bottom quarter of the draw.The landscape of the men’s game has changed dramatically since a year ago: no Andy Murray or Roger Federer, with Novak Djokovic showing glimpses of his old form in Rome – and starting against one of the 12 qualifiers.The 2017 final was the most one-sided since Nadal beat David Ferrer in straight sets five years ago. Wawrinka – who beat Murray in the semis - took a mere six games off him in just over two hours.As the draw was being made in Paris on Thursday – in the evening, for the first time – the Swiss, seeded third, was bagelled in the second of two losing sets against Marton Fucsovics, the Hungarian world No 60 and former world No 1 junior, in the closing quarter-final in Geneva."

Johanna Konta insists she is comfortable playing on clay – despite a thin résumé in five visits to Roland Garros. It says much for her self-belief.“This is only my third French Open main draw by ranking,” she said, “so I think it would be a little bit unfair to say completely that my record is terrible. I would like to give it a few more years.”She has a chance to prove doubters wrong against the demonstrative Kazak battler Yulia Putintseva with whom she wiped the clay of Rome the last time they met, a year ago. However, losing to the delightfully artistic doubles specialist Hsieh Su-wei here last year after winning the first set 6-1, was the upset of the opening round. And the year before, she went out at the first time of asking against Julia Goerges, who was ranked 57 in the world but had struck form.“I’ve only qualified for two slams and one of them was here, so I have experienced success in Paris. The one last year was an incredibly tough one against Su-wei – and we’ve all seen since then how well she can play.“Before that was against Julia Goerges, who plays incredibly well on this surface and made the final in Nuremburg the week before. So there needs to be respect given to the players that I played and the level that they produced.“But, as for how I feel on the surface, every year that I come here I look forward to it because I know I can play well on the clay. Before I started playing more on the WTA tour I actually won most of my Challengers on the clay, especially at the very beginning. I’d like to give myself a little more time.”That confidence might come under pressure in her first match.“You’ll need to ask her why she does it,” Konta said of Putintseva’s ability to light up a court with her language as well as her racket. “In my experience, most players act the way they do in their own self-interest, in getting their emotions out and basically working with their own demons on court. She will deal with the match the way she feels she needs to deal with it to win, and I will deal with the match the way that I feel I need to deal with it to win.”Konta’s penchant to see all sides of a debate should qualify her to negotiate a way out of Brexit, and she was similarly diplomatic when asked what she thought about the tournament not seeding Serena Williams on her return to slams after winning the 2017 Australian Open, and now the proud mother of Alexis Olympia.Although not a great one for analysing the draw (she didn’t even know it had been made on Thursday evening), Konta appeared pleased when told she was not in the American’s section – and that Williams was vying in the first week with Garbiñe Muguruza, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Maria Sharapova in a quality charge at the semis.Williams starts against Krystina Pliskova and looks on course for a fourth-round meeting with Sharapova – who surprised a few people in Rome last week when she supported a review of the WTA rules to seedings and long absences.“Wow, it’s a very strong quarter,” Konta said. “There are no easy matches any more, regardless of who you play. We’ve had plenty of proof through the last number of years that there are going to be upsets, there are going to be new breakthroughs, there are going to be oohs and aahs and all that. Whatever match you play, whatever quarter you’re in, you’ve got your work cut out for you.”Konta, still with her diplomat’s hat on, refused to be drawn on the topic of the week: whether or not Williams should be seeded here, after a long absence from the Tour.“It’s important to remember that there were mothers previously, such as Kim Clijsters, who came back and who weren’t seeded. It’s an ongoing conversation. I think it’s important to find a good balance of rewarding the current players who have earned their right to be a seed and also supporting returning mothers.”And what would that good balance be? Smiling, she replied, “It’s a good question. Honestly, I don’t quite know. I think seeding is on a player’s current form.“It would also be unfair of a player who is coming back being put into that position as well, as well as the players who are currently playing but you are taking that away if they’ve earned it.”Konta, ranked 22 in the world after a long spell in the top 10, needs a good run in this tournament and is confident she can finally do it.“This year, preparation-wise, I’ve had some really great matches on the clay. I feel like I’m playing to my level in general, regardless of surface. I’m playing better and better. So I’m hoping to continue that here.“I back myself in every way to be able to go deep into the tournament, go on to the end – but it starts with the first round.”"

Serena Williams, the grande dame of tennis, returns to her job at the highest level in Paris this coming week, as a 36-year-old mother with as much to prove as when she came from 5-3 down in the third set against Kim Clijsters en route to winning the first of her 23 majors, 19 years ago at Flushing Meadows.Among the American’s many admirers and rivals in the game Johanna Konta is in awe of her, for returning to the court after being away for most of the past 18 months, and her decision to defy convention. She knows, too, how dangerous Williams can be when cornered: as when Heather Watson had her on the ropes at Wimbledon in 2015 but could not land the knockout blow; or at Roland Garros a month earlier when, so sick she could barely walk to the service line, she won the deciding set to love against Timea Bacsinszky to reach the final. Williams, Konta understands, is a born fighter.Konta, whose campaign begins on Sunday against the world No 93, Yulia Putintseva, is eloquent in her praise and analysis. “I don’t know [what it must feel like for Williams] because I haven’t given birth,” she says. “I’m not a mother and I haven’t been off Tour for that length of time. I wouldn’t want to have a child and come back. I’d like to have my tennis career and then have a family. That’s just a personal preference. That’s a choice every woman has the choice to make.“It’s a tough call. There’s a lot of women on Tour who are at the age where society thinks they should be thinking of motherhood or wanting to have children. There’s a lot of expectation on women in their 30s of: ‘Why haven’t you had a child yet? Can you have children?’“It’s a woman’s prerogative of when and if they want to have children, and what profession they choose and how long they choose to do it. In sport it’s a little bit different because of the physical side.“But it’s a tremendous achievement to be able to bring your body back to being fighting fit in that way. Seeing women like Jessica Ennis-Hill and Paula Radcliffe and what they have achieved and the way they have been able to work their way back to the elite level of their sport after having children – I think it’s incredible. I want to see a man do it!”Konta does not think she will be playing tennis at Serena’s age, adding, “But again, who knows?”Williams, who celebrated the birth of her first child by lending her name to a series of insightful TV documentaries on her new life as a mid-30s mother and athlete, has accidentally inspired a debate that rumbled into Paris on the eve of her return to the big time: should her reputation entitle her to a seeding after she has been away from the game for so long (apart from four matches this year)? The tournament officials looked to their rules and history, said “No” and the furore intensified.Konta revealed the WTA players’ council, on which she sits, has discussed the issue. Unlike Maria Sharapova, no great friend of the American but who supports her on this one, Konta is undecided.She sees merit in respecting Williams’s stature and achievements, as well as the rights of others who have worked hard to be seeded. Yet, stripped back, the argument has flaws. If seedings are meant to reflect the likelihood of a player winning the tournament, only a fool would say Williams is not worth a place in the top 10, at least – despite her lack of activity.A more reliable guide follows the money – and the American betting expert, Sean Calvert, who correctly picked a 100-1 shot, John Isner, to win the Miami Open this year (where Williams lost in the first round to Naomi Osaka), has Williams at 10-1, which seems about right. In front of her, in his estimation, are the world No 1, Simona Halep, an 11-2 favourite, Elina Svitolina (8-1) and Garbiñe Muguruza (9-1).Yet, because of their adherence to custom, the official seedings do not rate Williams, arguably the greatest player of all time, among the best 32 players in the draw. First up she plays Kristyna Pliskova, the world No 70. Greater danger lurks in the second round, where the 17th seed, Ashleigh Barty, is a likely opponent. Beyond that lie either Sharapova or Pliskova’s sixth-seeded sister, Karolina. And that could be where the discussion is put to bed.For Konta there are a lot more positives than negatives in Williams returning. “It’s exciting. It shows incredible strength as a woman,” she says. “Also, breaking down boundaries, in a way it’s showing the world that there aren’t those self-imposed limitations that a lot of people see. And it’s important to give her the respect of finding the level that she wants to play at – however long and however many matches that takes.“I know that she feels she’s back, because she can perform at the level that she wants to play at and she’s prepared to be in those positions and playing the big matches. That’s the confidence that every player has on court, that everyone who plays on the Tour has.“Otherwise we wouldn’t be playing. I personally don’t expect anything of her. I expect her to enjoy what she is doing.”That alone would be a victory."

Serena Williams considers the black bodysuit she wore at the French Open much more than a fashion statement.The full-length, skintight outfit is designed to protect against blood clots. But it isn’t only practical.The suit also contains a message that Williams wanted to send about self-worth as she returns to grand slam action with a first-round victory at Roland Garros on Tuesday, about nine months after giving birth to a daughter.“It feels like this suit represents all the women that have been through a lot mentally, physically, with their body to come back and have confidence and to believe in themselves,” Williams said, after beating Kristyna Pliskova 7-6 (4), 6-4 at Court Philippe Chatrier. “I definitely feel like it is an opportunity for me to inspire a whole different group of amazing women and kids.”This suit represents all the women that have been through a lot mentally, physically, with their bodyThe outfit called to mind Williams’s black “catsuit” that she wore at the 2002 US Open. It also was reminiscent of the white bodysuit that the American player Anne White wore at Wimbledon in 1985.Williams referred to what she wore Tuesday as the “catsuit — the new version, 2.0”.“I call it, like, my Wakanda-inspired catsuit,” referring to the fictional nation in the film Black Panther.“We designed it way before the movie,” she said, “but still, it kind of reminds me of that.”Williams said she feels “like a warrior princess, kind of” when she wears the outfit.“I’m always living in a fantasy world,” she added. “I always wanted to be a superhero and it’s kind of my way of being a superhero.”Tuesday’s match was the first at a major tournament for the 23-time Grand Slam champion in 16 months.She gave birth to her daughter Alexis Olympia on 1 September, then dealt with serious complications related to a pulmonary embolism. After her recovery Williams revealed that she almost died giving birth.“I had a lot of problems with my blood clots, and, God, I don’t know how many I have had in the past 12 months. So it is definitely a little functionality to it,” Williams said. “I have been wearing pants in general a lot when I play, so I can keep the blood circulation going. It’s a fun suit but it’s also functional, so I can be able to play without any problems.”The suit garnered a lot of fans on social media, including Williams’s partner Alexis Ohanian Snr.Yes she is. And that superhero outfit. https://t.co/RQqGR6OHX8Associated Press contributed to this report"
tennis,"The hyperbolic reaction to the FFT’s decision to not seed Serena at Roland Garros is a prime example of selective outrage

Fri 25 May 2018 09.15 BST

Sometimes we Americans can go a little overboard when it comes to our star athletes, particularly in sports where our collective interest in them is more sporadic. Tennis is one of those sports that only commands mainstream attention a few times out of the year. The current spring clay-court season puts a fine point on the overall indifference for the sport in the US, as only the most hardcore of fans lament how the poor coverage of the red dirt’s biggest events are in the States, from Monte Carlo and Rome all the way to NBC’s annual horror show next week.This inherent apathy among those who only pay attention during the grand slams was exposed this week with the outsized reaction to the news that the French Tennis Federation has declined to seed Serena Williams in the women’s draw. That of course means that the 23-time grand slam champion could face anyone in the first round, including the current top players in the world. Serena v Simona Halep, the world No1? Serena vs Caroline Wozniacki, her beloved bestie and the Australian Open champion? Serena vs Venus? Serena v hater Maria Sharapova? Everything is in play for round one.Amid Serena’s comeback from the birth of her first child, the FFT’s ruling has drawn the ire of many part-time followers of tennis. Some feel that Serena should have been given a seed that would have reflected her protected ranking – she was No 1 in the WTA rankings when she won the 2017 Australian Open before going on maternity leave – customarily given to players who are out of the game due to pregnancy or injury. And though the women’s locker room is split on the pregnancy seeding debate, as former WTA doubles star and ESPN analyst Rennae Stubbs indicated on CNN, big stars such as Halep, Sharapova and Italian Open winner Elina Svitolina come down in favor of the seeding protection.That, even with the practical and mathematical complications of how a player’s protected seeding would be applied after a few tournaments, is a sensible change to discuss.However, we Americans had a typical overboard moment when USA Today’s Nancy Armour (and whoever writes her headlines) deemed that Serena was being “punished” by the FFT for their decision.Let’s dial back the hyperbole, tout de suite.The FFT would be “punishing” Williams if it were treating her entirely different from all her elite colleagues on the tour and former co-workers who experienced pregnancy during their career to then comeback. Yet the three-time French Open champion is not facing a contrasting set of rules and behaviors that her friendly rival Victoria Azarenka encountered in her return from the birth of her son Leo around this time last year.There were no strident and sentimental columns from Armour last year about how Azarenka should have been given a protected seed by Wimbledon and was being punished by the All England Club. Nor was there any approaching this level of consternation or debate here in America, or throughout the entire global tennis community for that matter, about whether the Belarusian received harsh action from Britain’s Lawn Tennis Association.A campaign for elite women’s players to have their seed protected in grand slams and the big tournaments just beneath them was also imperceptible from media figures everywhere when Kim Clijsters made her comeback, or as she dubbed her “second career”, in 2009. The Belgian, who had stated years prior to her first retirement the desire to have children early in her life, was the template example of how the seeding rule for elite women on maternity leave should have been implemented back then by the WTA, the International Tennis Federation and the four slams.In her first major back, Clijsters would go on to win the 2009 US Open (keeping her cool opposite an infamous Serena implosion along the way), but did it as an unseeded, unranked entrant without a hint of the groundswell the FFT’s decision elicited this week, say nothing of the breathless cable news discussions. Only for the biggest star, the American and global icon Serena, did it all of a sudden become cause célèbre.If we are to show full respect for women’s athletes and the betterment of tennis overall, it is salient for the punditry to care about about all of the players all of the time and not just when it pertains to Serena or other American luminaries.The FFT did not punish Serena. But we all punish the WTA, and tennis in general, when we don’t consistently keep the whole picture in view. Especially we Americans."

Wimbledon does not intend to change the name of its ladies’ tournament to “women’s” despite the positive reaction garnered by Chelsea football club rebranding its women’s team.The ladies’ singles has run concurrently to the gentlemen’s at the championships since 1884, but the gentlemen’s tournament is more commonly referred to as the men’s by the players themselves and on TV commentary.A spokeswoman for the All England Lawn Tennis Club, which runs Wimbledon, confirmed there were no plans afoot to change the names of either the gentlemen’s or ladies’. But it and other sporting institutions are facing calls to modernise their language and reflect the growing popularity of women’s sport.It follows the announcement made by Chelsea this week that they will change from Chelsea Ladies to Chelsea Football Club Women as of next season. The club said the decision was made after consulting with the board and players and is intended to reflect the “ever-growing status” of the women’s game and move away from referring to the men’s side as the “first” team.Their manager, Emma Hayes, who is currently on maternity leave, said: “This name change demonstrates the club’s desire to put women’s football at the front and centre of everything we do. Chelsea’s commitment to the women’s game is unwavering and this decision is something I fully support.”Chelsea are not the first football team to change their name. Last year Arsenal dropped the “ladies” from their name and became Arsenal Women although they only use the second part of their name when necessary to distinguish from the men. Manchester City did the same in 2014.In the Women’s Super League, the top tier of football in England, nine teams now have “ladies” in their names, while seven have “women”. The decision was greeted enthusiastically by current Chelsea squad members, who spoke to media around the world about the change. They dominated the domestic league this season, lifting the title without losing a game and beating Man City to win the FA Cup, in front of a record domestic crowd of 45,000 at Wembley. They also reached the semi-final of the Champion’s League.The team’s Swedish goalkeeper, Hedvig Lindahl, said: “I’m very happy that the club has decided to take this important step. It’s actually something that will go down in history, that we are now spoken about in an equal manner. This is something that the club wants to reach, equality, and you have to have the language to represent that as well.”But Deborah Cameron, professor of language and communication at the University of Oxford, said she thought the bottom line, rather than a commitment to gender equality, was probably the driving force.“I think language makes a big difference in perception,” she said, “but this is basically a branding decision, modernising in the light of women’s football achieving a much higher profile lately. I think it’s probably down to the commercial people rather than the football people trying to bring this into the 20th century.“As a linguist and a feminist it’s a very significant difference in sociocultural terms but I doubt that’s what they were thinking. I think they were probably thinking it sounds Ye Olde England and it doesn’t really fit with football and the skill and physicality of the women’s game.”Prof Cameron said she doubted whether Wimbledon, steeped in history, would ever follow suit. It is understood that the All England Club does not feel it needs to alter the name of the tournaments as ladies’ and gentlemen’s are comparable terms. The male and female winners of the singles tournaments have been awarded the same prize money since 2007. “With Wimbledon, one difference is nobody ever says gentlemen’s whereas you do hear that with ladies,” Cameron added, “but I think Wimbledon probably will keep it because it fits with the nostalgia and snobbery, if you like, of their brand.”"

Bernard Tomic is one win away from the main draw of this year’s French Open after storming into the final round of qualifying in Paris. The Australian’s impressive 6-3, 6-1 victory over rising Briton Jay Clarke booked the fallen tennis star a date on Friday with Portugal’s Gonçalo Oliveira.Few would have predicted after his humiliating failure to qualify for his home grand slam in January – and subsequent appearance on reality TV and rankings plunge to outside the world’s top 200 – that Tomic would rebound so spectacularly on the European clay.But after winning six of his past seven matches on the red dirt, his best ever run on his least preferred surface, the one-time Wimbledon quarter-finalist is now tantalisingly close to a spot in the French Open main draw.Overlooked for a wildcard at the season’s first two majors, exiled from the Australian Davis Cup fold and dumped by his racquet sponsor after his lame Wimbledon showing last year, Tomic had his polarising coach and father John in support on Roland Garros’s outside court six on Wednesday.Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every dayConcerned pre-match that his battered body might not hold up after so much tennis in recent weeks, Tomic looked in trouble early against Clarke.The fatiguing Queenslander was staring down break points at 2-2 in the opening set but he escaped and nudged ahead 4-2 after Clarke gifted him a break with a loose game from 30-0 up on serve. It proved the only break in a 46-minute dogfight of a first set.Relieved and growing in confidence, Tomic only needed half as long to nab the second – and the match – to be Australia’s lone men’s qualifying survivor.Playing just his second match in five weeks, an underdone Thanasi Kokkinakis was gallant in a 6-7 (4-7), 6-1, 6-2 second-round loss to Estonian Jürgen Zopp. “The guy’s missed one first serve in about two hours,” Kokkinakis said during the defeat. Kokkinakis has been training at the Patrick Mouratoglou Academy in the French Riviera since injuring his knee in a freak on-court fall at last month’s Monte Carlo Masters. But not even the presence of Serena Williams’ esteemed coach in his courtside box could inspire the 22-year-old to victory.One of only two players this year to topple Roger Federer, the luckless South Australian plans to return to Mouratoglou’s base to build his fitness for the looming grass-court season.Exciting youngster Akira Santillan also bowed out in three sets, 6-1, 3-6, 6-0 to French wildcard Alexandre Müller.Earlier on Wednesday, 20-year-old Lizette Cabrera saved Australia’s women from a qualifying wipe-out with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 win over Japan’s Junri Namigata. Cabrera must win two more matches to join Ashleigh Barty, Daria Gavrilova, Samantha Stosur, Ajla Tomljanovic and Isabelle Wallace in the Open main draw.But teenage ace Destanee Aiava, Arina Rodionova, Olivia Rogowska and Priscilla Hon all bombed out in the first round of qualifying. Aiava collapsed from a set and a service break up in a 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 defeat to China’s Fangzhou Liu.Rogowska and Hon also squandered one-set leads. Rogowska succumbed 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 to Liechtenstein’s Kathinka Von Deichmann, while Hon went down 0-6 6-2 6-4 to Italian Deborah Chiesa. Rodionova lost 6-3, 6-4 to local wildcard Harmony Tan."

Venus Williams is out of the French Open on the opening day of the tournament. The 2002 runner-up lost 6-4, 7-5 to Wang Qiang of China in the first round on Court Suzanne Lenglen on Sunday.Wang avenged her loss to No9 seed Williams in the first round at Roland Garros last year. The world No85 was also beaten by Williams at Wimbledon a few weeks later and had never beaten her American opponent before Sunday.Williams has a mixed record in Paris. Sunday’s defeat was the fourth time Williams has lost in the first round of the French Open in 21 appearances, and she has not progressed beyond the fourth-round since 2006. More concerning for Williams is the fact that she also lost in the first round at the Australian Open in January. The 37-year-old did, however, reach the final of Wimbledon and the Australian Open in 2017. Of the other US players in action on Sunday, Madison Brengle also lost in the first round but there were wins for Jennifer Brady and US Open champion Sloane Stephens. In the men’s draw, Jared Donaldson won in five sets while Denis Kudla made an early exit in straight sets."

Roger Federer believes Serena Williams’ achievements are enough to merit a place as the greatest tennis player of all time.In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Wednesday, Federer expresses his admiration for Williams, who has 39 grand slam titles including 23 in singles.“[Williams’s career] has been fascinating to watch. She had a totally different upbringing – I came up through Switzerland with the federation, she did it with her dad and her sister,” says Federer in the interview. “It’s an amazing story unto itself – and then she became one of the greatest, if not the greatest tennis player of all time.”Federer is then asked to clarify if he means Williams is the best female player of all time or the best overall. “Overall,” he says. Federer, whose 20 grand slam singles titles are the most by any male player, adds the far from controversial point that his achievements rank with the greats. “But we know [Williams] is all the way up there. I’m probably up there with somebody, somehow. Maybe there’s a group, a best of five – and if you’re in that group, you should be pleased and happy. Tennis is a funky sport when it comes to that stuff.”Federer, who is two months younger than Williams, will turn 37 in August but he is enjoying a late-career resurgence with three grand slam titles since the start of 2017. He says he has not set a date for retirement and says he still enjoys playing. “I’ve long given up that it needs to end in a fairy tale,” he says. “I don’t need to be ranked [No1] or need it to be after a big title. If it happens that way, that’s amazing. But you can’t control it all. You have to put yourself out there, be vulnerable. I play because I love tennis, not because it needs to end [perfectly].”Federer has four children and admits he tore a meniscus in 2016 while he was preparing a bath for his daughters: “It’s absolutely funny. It’s crazy.” His children have excellent tennis genes too: his wife, Mirka, was ranked No76 in the world. Federer says he is in no rush for them to follow his career path though. “Yeah, they play a bit,” he says. “It’s one of my mini-requirements with Mirka. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want them to be professional players, but I would like them to play recreationally.”Federer will not play in this month’s French Open but will defend his Wimbledon title later this summer."

Mahut has forced Del Potro to serve for it. 

7.09pm BST

Mahut is trying his arse off, fighting to deuce on Del Potro’s serve, but yerman just doesn’t look in any trouble whatsoever and quickly closes out, the clinching point an absolutely monstrous ace. Mahut will now serve to stay in the match at 3-5.

More: he’s not great on clay because he hits it so flat, and movement for such a unit is more difficult. 

7.04pm BST
19:04

Back to Del Potro’s chances, I’m informed by a coach that the slice situation is more of a disadvantage on clay: on a hard court it skids, but on clay it sits up to be thwacked. On the other hand, it’s easier for Del Potro to run around it than on any other surface. 

7.02pm BST
19:02

Del Potro consolidates and quickly racks up two break points for 5-2. Mahut saves the first with an ace, then plays a fine point to account for the second. He has the survive another immediately afterwards, but eventually serves out. 

6.53pm BST
18:53

Del Potro has broken to love! He is flowing now, leading 3-2 and 2-1. And back to whether he can win this thing, I wonder if his backhand situation - he has to slice almost all the time - will matter least on clay. On the other hand, Nadal’s forehand is perfectly designed to attack it, so. Updated

Some turnaround on Suzanne-Lenglen. Juan Martin del Potro is having one of his Juan Martin del Potro moments. Having lost the first set 6-1 to Nicolas Mahut, and seemingly in no shape to make it a contest, he’s won the second set 6-1.

5.49pm BST
17:49

Del Potro has been struggling with a thigh injury, which explains that horror show of a first set, but he’s looking in fine nick now. He’s made a lightning start to the second set, breaking to lead 3-0 against Nicolas Mahut.

17:17

Serena Williams speaks! “She played really well. I don’t know how many aces there were. For every ace there’s money donated to a good cause. Two years has been a really long time since my last match on clay but I feel good. I trained hard. I’m just happy to have a won match here. I take it one day at a time.”

5.15pm BST
17:15

On the face of it Serena Williams winning a first-round match at a grand slam doesn’t seem like much of a story - until you remember that it’s her first competitive tennis since March, her first on clay in two years and her first match at a major since she gave birth to her first child. Her nerves at the end are no surprise. She butchers her first match point with a dreadful drop shot and then she has to wipe out three break points as Pliskova comes out swinging. But when she earns a second match point, Pliskov nets a forehand. That’s it. Williams holds her hands in the air to salute the crowd and then she walks back to her chair. All very contained.Updated

Serena Williams is broken at last. That tough end to the first set might have taken a toll on her and it’s Kristyna Pliskova who lands the first blow at the start of the second.

4.34pm BST

Serena Williams is having problems on serve in the second game of the second set. It’s been deuce for a while. Meanwhile Jack Sock leads 7-6, 2-6, 6-4 against Jurgen Zopp.

The sun’s out and the British No1 is through to the second round of the French Open after a controlled victory over his young Australian foe, who was too erratic to leave any lasting damage on the 22-year-old.

Dominic Thiem has taken a 6-2, 2-6, 6-4 lead against Stefanos Tsitispas on Court 18. Play’s been suspended there but the sun’s still shining in Paris. Just about. There might be time for Lucas Pouille to finish things off against Cameron Norrie. He leads by two sets and a break.

In darkening light Cameron Norrie gives himself some hope, breaking to 15 in the second game of the third set on Philippe-Chatrier. The advantage doesn’t last long, though, as Lucas Pouille breaks back in the very next game. The Frenchman leads 6-2, 6-4, 1-2 and is about to serve.

Pouille carves out three set points and seals the first with an ace out wide. The 16th seed is too strong for young Cameron Norrie, who surely won’t be coming back from this perilous position.

Lucas Pouille bangs an ace out of reach to lead 6-2, 5-3. Meanwhile Pauline Parmentier is running away with it on Suzanne-Lenglen, where she leads 6-7, 6-4, 4-0 against Alize Cornet. Quite the turnaround.

The world No 1, Simona Halep, collapsed spectacularly in her rematch with Elina Svitolina to hand the Ukrainian a second Italian Open title.It took the fourth seed just over an hour to dispose of her wounded foe, 6-0, 6-4, her fourth win over Halep in six meetings. Last year they battled for more than two hours and three sets in the final before Svitolina overpowered Halep. This time the one-way traffic started early.They head for Roland Garros encouraged by solid performances during the week here but Halep has cause for concern if, as seems likely, she has a back problem. The Romanian was not remotely in the contest in an opening set that sped by in 19 minutes and, after taking a medical timeout in the second, managed to make something of a fight of it.However, it was a disappointing spectacle for a showpiece event on Campo Centrale, which is normally a bearpit in big matches, with the Roman crowd craning forward from the steep seats baying for action as if it were the coliseum. The gladiatorial content was minimal on Sunday.Halep looked to be restricted in her sideways movement, although she was all smiles during the presentation, regretting that she could not have performed better when it mattered. Both finalists had reached the decider having dropped a single set.In the first frame Halep’s attack lacked all potency as she took only two points from 15 first serves and was constantly on the back foot in rallies, yet still managed to save two of five break points before succumbing. Svitolina dominated her with ball in hand, winning a phenomenal 86% of first serves.Halep left the court for a medical time out at 2-3 in the second and returned to engage in a fightback that finally spluttered into life in the seventh game, when she saved two break points to hold with an ace for 3-4. She threatened to break serve in the eighth game but Svitolina held her composure.Clearly still not properly coordinated in her movement, Halep struggled to stay in the contest, with the sympathy of the crowd countermanding the determination of her opponent. She fought to deuce, thrashing her forehand as hard as she could into the corners, and held with a scorching backhand down the line. But she looked far from happy as Svitolina stepped up to serve for the match just past the hour.Svitolina calmly worked the ball to either side, setting up two championship points with a forehand to the deuce corner, but slugged a backhand into the tramlines. Halep did the job for her, though, by dumping a tired backhand into the net.The champion’s celebrations were as low-key as the loser’s resignation was complete. It was not a great final.“It’s the second time, so I wish I will be in the final again next year and maybe win it,” Halep said.For Svitolina it was just “a very, very special day” to retain her trophy. She thanked the fans wholeheartedly, in the worn tradition of such gestures, but there will not have been many in the crowd who went away with fond memories of this one-sided affair."
tennis,"The French Open champion steadfastly sees the Serb, despite his struggles with injury, as ‘one of the candidates to win’

For all the inclination in some quarters to park Novak Djokovic in the past, given his slow recovery from injury, the rival who has played him most, Rafael Nadal, refuses to join the clamour.While the sans-culottes might be baying at the castle walls in Paris – Kyle Edmund and Cam Norrie under the British flag, alongside Alexander Zverev, Denis Shapovalov, Dominic Thiem, a wounded Nick Kyrgios and a handful of others – there is no strong evidence to suggest the 117th staging of the French Open will witness the total collapse of the ancient regime.“Novak is one of the best players in the history of this sport,” Nadal said on Friday as he prepares his bid to win an 11th title at Roland Garros.Their names fell on opposite sides of the draw on Thursday, so a 52nd meeting could happen only in the final, a collision that might require Nadal to get past Marin Cilic or Juan Martín del Potro (who is carrying a groin strain), while Djokovic has potential obstacles of varying difficulty in Grigor Dimitrov, Kyrgios and Zverev, who is seeded second in the absence of Roger Federer.Nadal starts against the eccentric Ukrainian hitter, Alexandr Dolgopolov, while Djokovic has drawn a qualifier, Rogério Dutra Silva, a battler who has toiled with minor distinction, mainly on South American clay, for 16 years and is ranked 132 in the world.Asked if he thought Djokovic could get back to his best, Nadal said: “My answer is he’s not coming back; he’s there always. Sometimes when you come back from injuries [it] is difficult to play that well from the beginning. But he played a great event in Rome and is no doubt one of the candidates to win here.“In Rome the Serb gave Nadal a high-level examination in two close sets in the semi-final of the Italian Open, which might have taken a slight edge off the Spaniard in the final, where he flirted with defeat before outlasting Zverev, the game’s rising star.The semi-final – and the tournament – was almost the perfect preparation for old friends whose first meeting was here in 2006, when Djokovic retired injured after two sets of their quarter-final.There is a good argument to be made that a refreshed and motivated Djokovic will be more dangerous here than Zverev, whose gathering aura at 21 needs the varnish of staying power for him to be a consistent threat over seven best-of-five matches in a two-week major championship.Nadal, of course, remains the raging favourite to lift another Coupe des Mousquetaires. To suggest otherwise is to entertain madness. He has won 79 and lost only two matches at Roland Garros since his debut in 2005, when he beat the Argentinian left-hander Mariano Puerta in the final, having seen off Federer in the semis. Nadal was 19. On Sunday week he turns 32. In that span he has endured more injuries than Bryan Robson.His views have rarely wavered. In his first recorded interview, at Monte Carlo in 2003, he batted away praise with all the certainty he brings to his famous forehand. “I’m [ranked] 100 now and I must work still a lot. Nothing comes easily. Things are very complicated and there are very good players out there.”On Friday, 15 years, 78 titles and nearly £65m ($86m) later, he said: “It is true I had a lot of success on clay during my career but every tournament is different. We are here to try our best.”But is it time for the new breed to make a definitive push in the majors?“There is a generation of players with a lot of talent and great potential to become big stars. Let’s see how things happens the next couple of months … or the next couple of years.”Edmund is on Nadal’s side of the draw and starts against the exciting young Australian wildcard, Alex de Minaur, who lit up his home major – as did Edmund, reaching the semi-final against Cilic before his hip gave up on him. Here he would have to beat Cilic in the quarters to have a shot at Nadal.Norrie, whose Scottish blood was nurtured in New Zealand, lurks outside the top 100 and had his best career result this week when he defeated world No10 John Isner to reach the Lyon semi-final. Gilles Simon beat him on Friday to reach the final, where he will play the German Peter Gojowczyk - who meets Norrie in the first round here."

Superheroes normally go to work in satin pants and a cape. Marco Trungelliti chose a rented car, packed with tennis rackets and hopes, as well as his wife, brother, mother and 88-year-old grandmother for a 500‑mile trip that ended on Monday afternoon in Paris with a heart-warming win against Bernard Tomic.True to the script of his career lassitude, “I’ve got millions” Bernie was later to Court No 9 than his opponent, who had driven for 10 hours from his home in Barcelona hoping to win some loose change as a lucky loser in the first round of the French Open.After nearly three hours on court the Argentinian, ranked 190 in the world, walked away with the victory by 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 and €99,000, nearly trebling his season’s earnings. And he was worth every cent, blowing Tomic away with 16 aces and 68 clear winners.Whatever happens now, he will cherish the moment. In 11 years striving on the tramlines, in singles and doubles from Alicante to Almaty and back, Trungelliti has averaged about $50,000 a year, before travelling and living expenses, in front of minuscule crowds. His pot here consists of half of the first-round money he had to split with Nick Kyrgios, as well as €79,000 for reaching the second round. He does not often earn that in one outing.INSÓLITO MOMENTO EN #RolandGarros. 😨🙏Marco #Trungelliti está viajando AHORA de Barcelona a París para jugar el draw como Lucky Loser. !Se bajaron 8 jugadores! DE LOCURAAA 🚗🚥🚨https://t.co/47TGzqNLfz pic.twitter.com/TMBDcBh0HzIt is a fairytale that might even linger past the second round. Trungelliti is good enough. Two years ago he put the world No 10, Marin Cilic, out in the first round on a rare visit to the main draw. On Wednesday he plays a kindred spirit in Marco Cecchinato, the world No 72 from Palermo, who spent three hours and 41 minutes beating the Romanian Marius Copil.Wearing a smile that refused to dim, Trungelliti explained the details of his odyssey. “We were at home with my family. My brother [Andre] and my grandma [Daphne] and my mamma [Susana] came from Argentina a week ago. They were going to come to Paris but I lost – so I [went home].“Then they rent a car to take a look at Barcelona and some other cities in Spain. We were preparing to go to the beach.“My coach told me: ‘Take a look at Mohamed Safwat [the Egyptian late replacement who lost to Grigor Dimitrov on Sunday]. He’s playing right now. Ask if you are going to get in.’ So I ask and somebody told me that I was the first alternate [to replace Kyrgios against Tomic]. Actually my grandma was in the shower and I told her: ‘OK, we go to Paris.’“There were many flights cancelled, so I didn’t trust too much. There was no train now in France so the best option was always just take the car. For us in Argentina, if you’re not living in Buenos Aires, then thousand kilometres is like nothing.”It was around 1pm when they left. Trungelliti had not even unpacked his kit from last week, when he was defeated in the qualifying tournament.Instagram images of the Trungelliti family roaring through Spain at an average speed of 70mph became an instant hit. “But it was good, no? It’s beautiful.”Within 10 hours they were at Roland Garros. Trungelliti says that after a light supper he got “five hours’ sleep, maximum” and was back at the club at 7.30am on Monday.He said his grandmother, whom he calls Abuelita, “has no idea what tennis is, really. She has no idea how to count it.” He added: “Actually she told me that she didn’t know that it was the end of the match until everybody was clapping. She’s amazing. She turns 89 in one month.”As for the future, he says: “Would be great to win, especially mentally for more than any other reasons. It doesn’t happen every day playing a second round in a grand slam.”Daphne will probably not be there, though. As Trungelliti says: “She believes in God very strongly, so she always puts candles to all the saints and it’s very rare that she would be on the court. I hope she’s OK. Well, I wouldn’t want her to die of stress.”Surrounded by Spanish-speaking journalists, he looked a little lost and said: “I never had a press conference with so many people. Not even when I played against Cilic two years ago.”If he beats Cecchinato, the hero from Barcelona will get another chance to share his charming tale."

A week ago, the only question in tennis that mattered was: can anyone beat Rafael Nadal on clay this summer? He was rampant as of old, fit and fired again with ambition to crush all-comers on his favourite surface.Nadal won again in Rome on Thursday – easily – and then the communal gaze switched to Alex Zverev. On Sunday he beat Dominic Thiem, who had beaten Nadal in the Madrid quarter-finals two days earlier. Nobody could have predicted the struggle he would have in extending his run of victories to 11 as Britain’s No 1, Kyle Edmund, took him down to the wire in the third round of the Italian Open.They traded blows of breathtaking power, Edmund saving seven match points before Zverev eked out the most dramatic of wins, 7-5, 7-6 (11). He now has every chance of still being there on Sunday, probably against Nadal, to defend the title he won a year ago.If Nadal reaches the final here, Edmund will automatically be seeded in the top 16 at the French Open, which starts on Sunday week. “I’ve not been a seed in any of the grand slams but I guess it avoids playing a top guy like Rafa or Novak [Djokovic],” he said. “And it’s good to see I’m going up the rankings.”Sunday’s final in Rome could be one to savour and Nadal, if he makes it, should have more in the tank than Zverev after dismissing Denis Shapovalov, 6-4, 6-1 in an hour and 22 minutes. But they are not the only actors in this play. Fabio Fognini, finally made the quarter-finals of his home tournament after beating the unseeded German, Peter Gojowczyk, 6-4, 6-4. His prize is … Nadal in the first match on Friday.The most thrills yesterday arrived when Zverev and Edmund brought their contrasting personalities together on the tournament’s glorious second court.Broken in the opening game, Edmund was back in business after several robust exchanges half an hour later, only to drop serve a second time. Zverev, whose serve frightens ballkids and dozing spectators, was banging them down at 128mph (207kph), 13mph faster than Edmund.Zverev, the world No 3, sealed the first set with a swinging ace down the T, his second, after 42 minutes.Edmund had to save three break points in the third game of the second set, but overcooked a crosscourt forehand. Zverev, getting ahead of himself, hit rashly on key points, then somehow rescued his serve for 3-1. Edmund would not lie down and, when his cause looked lost under a fusillade of booming serves, he doggedly got back to four-all.Two double-faults in the ninth game nearly scuppered his fightback but it was Zverev’s racket that was shaking more obviously and, after losing three games in a row, he found himself serving to stay in the set,With the court at his mercy on deuce, Edmund butchered a volley, but hung on to force set point as Zverev wobbled. Edmund made three astonishing gets in a row but could not reach Zverev’s clinching winner, and they were back on level terms. It was now a test of Edmund’s nerve and his serve. Both held.They went to the tie-break, where the drama intensified. Edmund saved for 11-all and a sixth match point. Zverev pushed him across the baseline for 12-11 and match point number seven. At the end of one final high-grade exchange, Edmund pushed a weary forehand just wide, and it was done.If they meet again in the French Open it would be reasonable to expect a repeat of these heroics. Both push themselves to the limit, Edmund with inscrutable calm, Zverev eyes bulging. Their rivalry is set. When Nadal, Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray do leave the stage, they will have a pair of excellent understudies in place.Johanna Konta leaves Rome for Paris mildly encouraged but also perhaps concerned after blowing a first-set lead against a top-10 player for the fourth time in a row when tJelena Ostapenko won their engrossing third-round match.Konta, who has slipped to 22 in the world looked to have put her early-season torpor behind her as she sought to build on decent wins this week over Magdalena Rybarikova and Hsieh Su-wei. However on a mild, overcast morning and coughing from a heavy cold, she found the step up beyond her to lose 6-2, 3-6,4-6.Konta broke her fingernail (on her bag) then Ostapenko’s serve in a bizarre opening to their second Tour encounter. After a brief delay to repair the digit, she was blasting the fifth seed off the court, and looked to be within sight of an early finish as her opponent complained of dizziness.Ostapenko got her first break point at the start of the second set – and Konta survived four deuces, saving a second break point with her fourth ace in the longest struggle of the match – but the world No 6 powered on to level at a set apiece.She held to love to stay in the match but Ostapenko’s shaky serve stood up and the 20-year-old forced a final wayward forehand out of Konta after two and a quarter hours."

A year after Alexander Zverev announced his arrival in the big time by crushing Novak Djokovic to win the Italian Open, the young German held his own but not his crown as Rafael Nadal outlasted him to win his eighth title on the Campo Centrale, 6-1, 1-6, 6-3 in two hours and nine minutes with two rain breaks.When it was put to him that the rain was not his friend Zverev smiled and nodded. “No, it’s not. But it happens. Nothing you can do about it. He came out way faster, played way more aggressive than I did. It took me a long time to get activated again. I ran out of time. The break took my momentum away.”Asked how he might convert his good run of three-setters to the much different challenge of a slam, he said: “I will try to play the same way over a longer period of time. But I don’t even want to think about tennis the next few days, then to Paris, where Rafa will be the favourite, no doubt about it.”Nadal was asked why Zverev has yet to convert his three-set form into success in the slams [he has not got past the fourth round and twice has blown 2-1 leads] and he bridled a little. “Tennis is tennis – best of three, best of five. Five sets is best for the best players and Sacha is one of the best players.”Ten years separate them in age, there is a gap of $90m in career earnings and the Spaniard now has 70 more titles than the 21-year-old world No 3. But Zverev is here to stay. He is growing in power and confidence and, seeded second in Roger Federer’s absence, he will be a threat at the French Open, which starts on Sunday and where Nadal will reach for his 11th Coupe de Mousquetaires. They cannot meet until the final.The demands of winning seven best-of-five matches in a row is still a huge ask for Zverev – as it will be for Dominic Thiem, who stopped Nadal’s run of 50 clay sets in a row in Madrid 9 days ago, before losing in the final to Zverev.The rival most likely to stop Nadal at Roland Garros could still be the man he has played 51 times over 12 years, and whom he beat for the 25th time in the semi-final on Saturday. Djokovic provided an exhausting test of Nadal’s game from start to finish; this was a stop-start skirmish, because of the elements and the efforts of the combatants.The sharpness the German showed in pushing Kyle Edmund deep and wide in their close third-round battle was not quite there in the early exchanges. He had to take risks he could get away with against lesser players. From there, errors crept into his game.He had been 40-love up in the sixth game when a lazy forehand handed Nadal another break opportunity and he cashed, in when a return popped up off the net, to go 5-1 up after half an hour. He served out the set, untroubled.The match was then turned on its head. Zverev put his heart and soul into a fightback and he finally got a look on Nadal’s serve in the second game and forced Nadal wide enough to overstretch on his forehand for the break.Zverev held to love and, in the space of a few minutes, the complexion of the contest changed from walkover to engaging theatre to potential upset.The fourth game was pivotal – in the match and possibly in Zverev’s season. He got overexcited when he dumped a forehand when trying to pass Nadal at the net for a 4-0 lead, then lobbed long. He outfoxed him in an exchange of drop shots to grab another break point – this time sealing it with a devastating backhand down the line. His fist-pump to his box screamed defiance and resolve.The match was taking on an eerie familiarity for Nadal. In Buenos Aires 13 years ago, he beat Gastón Gaudio 0-6, 6-0, 6-1. There would be no bagel – nobody has done that to him since Roger Federer in Hamburg nine years ago – but he could not stop Zverev wrapping up the set 6-1 with another unreachable backhand.Zverev played a drop-shot to engineer the break at the start of the final frame – and, as the rain arrived, he held for 2-0. The gathering – including most of Nadal’s family – took in a gasp of warm, moist air. For Zverev, impatient to finish the job, a 22-minute pause to let the showers pass was a minor irritant. For Nadal, it allowed him time to regroup and when they resumed ever so briefly in a light drizzle he held for 2-3. Again, the rain held up the royal progress.Nadal was asking the more searching questions. His whipped forehand was down from a tournament average of 193kph to 167kph, yet he still bossed the important exchanges with angles and timing.Trailing in the serving cycle, Zverev struggled to control his temperament and his opponent. Another attacking lob drifted long and Nadal finished the job with a backhand drop shot that not even the fleet-footed Zverev could reach."

“You’re not really thinking about it. You’re in the zone, you’re in the match. You go into a place where you’re right in it, zoned in. The crowd is the crowd, a great atmosphere. If you could take yourself out of your body and look at the environment you’re playing in, it’s a special occasion playing on that court. It’s packed and you’re in a dogfight. But there’s no nerves. You’re just playing. You’re obviously aware of the situation but it wouldn’t help to get nervous. You have to keep going and believe in yourself.”Thus did Kyle Edmund describe his departure from the Italian Open in a tie-break against the defending champion, Alexander Zverev, that they stretched over 24 points, long, tense exchanges piling on top of each other like layers of too much chocolate cake melting in the afternoon sun. The fans, crammed on to the marble steps of Court Pietrangeli – an open‑air theatre of delights – were spent and sated. So, how could the players fail to engage?Yet the remarkable thing about Edmund was that, half an hour later, he had “turned the mixer off”, as builders say. He could describe what he had endured but it was gone, a score in the book. He has that rare ability to look at himself from the outside. The result and performance meant no more than a lot of other trials, except it lifted him to the level of his star-spangled opponent, a long-haired, flamboyant German of Russian descent whose adrenaline levels probably were still raging deep into the night.They have played three times now and Edmund is getting closer to beating him. In the years to come they will have many such matches, if we are lucky. Zverev – who beat Edmund in the quarter-finals of the boys’ championship at the French Open in 2012 – is 21 and No 3 in the world. He went on to take a set off Rafael Nadal in the final and, in the absence of Roger Federer, will be seeded No 2 – so they could meet again in the French Open final on Sunday fortnight. Edmund is 23 and will be seeded in the top 16 at Roland Garros, avoiding an early collision with the big beasts.In the Race to London for the ATP Finals at the O2 in November, Zverev leads the pack, 35 points ahead of Federer. Edmund is 11th but only 100 points or so outside the cut‑off. If Zverev is a meteor, Edmund is not blinded by his trail.Zverev, tunnel-visioned, does not often talk about his rivals but he respects and fears Edmund. “The last 18 months he’s improved his backhand a lot, his ground strokes a lot,” he said in Rome. “Every short ball that he gets, he tries to go for it – and he’s not missing much. Before, his backhand was unstable, which it isn’t now. He’s using it very well down the line. His forehand is massive, and he’s not scared to go for it. When he’s on, he’s definitely a top-10 player.”In the absence of Andy Murray – who is agonising about when to break his 11-month injury sabbatical – Edmund is Britain’s best tennis player. The public are wondering, still, if he can follow the Scot to victory in one of the four majors. So is he.Murray’s absence and Edmund’s rise invite the question: where will the latter eventually fit in the list of Britain’s best players of recent years? At 23 and with no titles to his name, he is some way behind Murray (indisputably first), Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski.Murray at that age, in 2010, was No 4 in the world. That year he won two titles, reached the Australian Open final, losing to Roger Federer, lost to Rafael Nadal in the Wimbledon semi-finals, beat Federer to win the Rogers Cup in Canada and went out in the third round of the US Open to Stan Wawrinka.Henman at 23 won two titles and 48 of 72 matches, against the likes of Goran Ivanisevic and Carlos Moya. His ranking for most of 1997 was in the top 20 – where Edmund, a semi-finalist at the Australian Open, finds himself now in arguably a tougher era.Rusedski at Edmund’s age, in 1996, had a season a little behind Henman’s a year later. He won 42 of 68 matches and one title, on carpet in Beijing – but his ranking slipped from 36 to 48 over the 12 months.So, comparing apples and oranges, Edmund is miles behind Murray at the same stage of their careers, could end up roughly on a par with Henman and maybe a little ahead of Rusedski.But he goes to Roland Garros with excellent form and decent history. He has already won more than $1m this season, along with 17 of 25 matches, and the French clay does not transfix him as it does some others. In three visits he has won four matches and lost only to world-class opponents in Kevin Anderson (2017), John Isner (2016) and Nick Kyrgios (on a walkover in 2015).The slower, adagio tempo of the red dirt suits his nature and his game. He has time to think, then strike. Few players hit their forehand harder. Not many serve bigger – excluding Zverev. But the younger prodigy, while capable of more spectacular tennis, does not have Edmund’s solidity.His calm exterior is no show. His agent, Lawrence Frankopan, says he has been a dream to handle. “He is real,” Frankopan says. “It would be crazy to try to change him. He is exactly as you see him: polite, quiet, thoughtful – and, away from the game, he’s got a great sense of humour.”Frankopan, who numbers among his tennis clients Wawrinka, Gaël Monfils and Donna Vekic – as well as Chris Evert – says marketing Edmund has been ridiculously straightforward. He first tapped into his northern background in Beverley with Yorkshire Tea and although the player does not enjoy travelling, he then brought British Airways on board. That is the sort of brand association that covers a range of perceptions.Edmund has an uncluttered vision of his career, picking his way through training options, adapting his game as his body and experience grow, and always aware that he needs to improve gradually rather than in a rush.Darren Chin, a former international sprinter who has worked with Usain Bolt, has been brought in to sharpen up Edmund’s footwork and acceleration and he says he has already seen an improvement in his linear mobility. He has always been good moving side to side but has lacked that spark to hunt down some of the subtle drop shots that are the hallmark of the clay-court game.“You have to adapt to a player’s physique,” Chin says. “We can all work on our flexibility, give ourselves a little bit more range. And that will be one of the things I’m hoping to work on with Kyle. You need that speed over five metres, to be explosive in those first two or three steps. We’re working on the reaction time as well.”Edmund observes: “It’s interesting for me to see what training sprinters do compared to us and interesting to see what the tennis world is like for him, compared to the athletics world. The first thing he commented on was the workload of what tennis players do, in terms of playing and travelling week after week. It is something he didn’t know. You only see tennis players when they’re playing on court. All the stuff that happens around it is something you don’t see.”And “all the stuff” is starting to come together. Edmund has been meticulous and methodical in his development. Nothing is hurried. He could have been a cricketer or a footballer but tennis is a good fit for his athleticism and natural power, which he has steadily added to with regular trips to join Murray at his winter training camp in Miami. Not many others have bothered – or been invited. Murray recognises in Edmund the same work ethic that helped change him from a runt into an imposing physical specimen.Edmund has the sculpted look and build, at 6ft 2in, that is ideal for modern tennis. The shoulders and levers are strong, the engine reliable. It was not always so. For a worryingly long time Edmund faded in five-setters he had looked like winning. Asked if he could have beaten Zverev if their match had been the best of five, rather than three, he smiled and said: “It’s never done till it’s done. So there’s always a chance you can win but I dunno … it’s a tough question.”With pleasing regularity, Edmund is finding the answers."

It is not often a player ranked 70 in the world gets to play on Court Philippe Chatrier – against someone ranked 381 points adrift of her. Nevertheless, there was no more fitting stage to welcome back the game’s most regal presence, Serena Williams, on a day that began under cloud and ended in uplifting sunshine as the American survived a searching examination of her credentials and resolve. She said later she fantasises about being “a warrior princess” and she was exactly that again, as she has been so many times.It made a nonsense, though, of the tournament’s decision to deny a former champion with such a distinguished pedigree a seeding, yet cash in on her celebrity by putting her and Kristyna Pliskova on the show court, packed on day three, with television ratings no doubt soaring by the point.Wallowing for now at 451 in the rankings after her long absence but leading Pliskova by 71 career titles and, after an hour and 45 minutes on a sultry afternoon, a winning score of 7-6 (4), 6-4, she showed she is back, at 36, a mother and an athlete ready to resume her day job.For how long and with what potency she will be a force in the game she has dominated for two decades we will not know until she scores a more emphatic win against a better opponent than Pliskova, or goes deep in a major – and maybe even adds to the 23 she has already accumulated, most recently last year in Melbourne when seven weeks pregnant.John McEnroe was not alone in thinking that a miracle will not occur in Paris this fortnight but observed: “If she’s hungry enough, she will win again.” She cannot play at anything less than full throttle but she was -adamant her priority is her young daughter, born last September.“I want to get home and see -Olympia, because I have been here all day. If I’m not practising, we’re hanging out. I’m concerned how that’s going to work out for me, because normally in grand slams, I do spend a lot of time at the site. She’s so young, I don’t really bring her. This is definitely going to be interesting.”There were more than a few eyes agog at her outfit on a warm afternoon, a skintight, Wakanda-style, black -catsuit, designed by Nike to capture the moment, but intended also to help her faltering blood circulation after a difficult childbirth.“The new version, 2.0, it’s cool. It’s really fun. We designed it way before the movie [Black Panther]. I feel like a warrior in it, like a warrior princess. I had a lot of problems with my blood clots. God, I don’t know how many I have had in the past 12 months. So there is definitely a little functionality to it. I have been wearing pants a lot when I play so I can keep the blood circulation going.”After Olympia and before Paris, there was Windsor and the royal wedding – and Williams was among the most prominent African-American guests there to celebrate with Meghan Markle and Harry. “It was exciting to see so much African-American culture impacted in the wedding,” she said. “I was really happy Meghan wanted to incorporate that into it. I think it was just a whole cultural shift and change. It was seeing how far African-Americans have come. I thought it was an incredibly inspiring and beautiful and really motivating thing.”As for the tennis, Williams played a little Fed Cup towards the end of last year, has won two of four Tour matches this season and withdrew from Madrid and Rome to ensure she was ready for a grand slam. So this was her proper comeback match, in a city where she always has felt comfortable with the language, the culture and the tennis.In an engrossing first set, Pliskova needed an ace – her 10th of 15 – to stay in the first set and was relieved when Williams hit long to take them to a tie-break but the Czech could not sustain her charge. The second set followed the pattern of the first until the 10th game. Serving for the match, Williams slipped and fell near the net at 30-all, got up smiling to grab match point, made a mess of a drop shot and had to save three break points before putting a seal on her glorious day when Pliskova dumped a forehand.Next up is the multisport -Australian phenomenon, Ashleigh Barty, who beat Natalia Vikhlyantseva 6-3, 6-1. Asked what she thought about playing Williams four years after losing to her in two quick sets at the -Australian Open, she said: “I’m in a very different place. I think Serena is also in a very different place. But what an opportunity. She’s a genuine champion. What she’s done to be able to get back – along with Vika [Azarenka] and a lot of the other girls who are coming back after pregnancy – is a pretty amazing thing.”"
tennis,"Novak Djokovic has admitted he is ‘not really satisfied’ with his performance against qualifier Jaume Munar in the French Open. The former champion, 31, posted a straight-sets win against the Spaniard, 21, to reach the third round of the Grand Slam, but was quick to point out that he needs to improve. Speaking after the match he said: ‘I feel like I need to go back to those days when I started playing tennis.’ Djokovic, who underwent right elbow surgery earlier this year, is the No 20 seed in Paris, his lowest Grand Slam seeding since the 2006 US OpenSource: SNTV

Twelve months after stepping on to the Tour as a full-time professional, with a strong left arm and no fear, Cameron Norrie is preparing to play the world No 16, Lucas Pouille, in front of the Frenchman’s home crowd on a show court at Roland Garros in the second round of the French Open.There are kids making pottery that have more experience with clay than the 22-year-old. However, if he was expected to be overawed on a muggy Monday afternoon against the world No 43, Peter Gojowczyk, he showed no signs of it, breezing past the German in 41 minutes.Gojowczyk, who is in excellent form having reached the Geneva Open final at the weekend, was down 1-6, 0-2 and 15-40 when he retired with a groin strain after Britain’s latest prodigy wrong-footed him with an artful and unreachable forehand.“I think that was the best tennis I have played in my life,” Norrie said, his New Zealand accent now masked by an international mix. “I was in the zone and not making any unforced errors, dictating play. I think if he’s winning, there’s no chance he’s retiring. I got my first win [in a major] with a retirement as well, so it would be nice actually to win a match. But I’ll take it.”As for his French adventure, he said, “I didn’t come here [last year] because I didn’t want to start my career with a loss on clay. I had never played [on it]. I headed straight to London and got ready for the grass. I was just taking it one step at a time.”Those steps have been huge ones for the son of a Scottish father and Welsh mother, who have been stalwart supporters of his development in their adopted country, then his move to London, and they backed his decision to quit college in Texas to pursue his career.The world No 10, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, stopped him in the first round at Wimbledon and he won a challenger in the United States before the wily Russian Dmitry Tursunov gave up on him in the first round at Flushing Meadows.Norrie’s learning curve steepened dramatically in Marbella in February when, against all expectations, he came from two sets down in his first Tour-level match on clay to beat Roberto Bautista Agut on his Davis Cup debut for Great Britain against Spain. Andy Murray described it as “one of the most amazing wins I have ever seen”.Norrie, who has worked his way assiduously from the 200s into the top 100, said: “This time last year I would be very excited to be ranked 85 in the world and in the second round of the French Open, that’s for sure. The thing about tennis is you always want more. You get to 85 and you want to be top 50.”He was on fire against the experienced Gojowczyk. The form he found to beat John Isner in Lyon last week, his first win against a top-10 player, remained in place as he polished off the first set in 24 minutes. Norrie placed his groundstrokes with care and force, with only two unforced errors, and served efficiently. He struck four aces and landed 21 of 31 first serves for a 71% win ratio, and was equally sound on second serve.Norrie has had the advantage of being a relatively unknown quantity in the locker room, although word of his Marbella heroics spread quickly, and his move to the UK is changing his profile. He may soon be exposed to the weight of further expectation, especially if he gives Pouille a convincing challenge on Wednesday.Pouille, two years older, announced his arrival two years ago in majors with a string of excellent wins against quality opposition. On Sunday, he conceded only nine games against the Russian Daniil Medvedev to reach the second round at his home major, where he has a 4-5 career record.Heather Watson, who broke a run of eight Tour defeats last week, continued her positive momentum at the French Open on Monday when she beat Océane Dodin 6-3, 6-0 in just over an hour on Court No 3.It was her sixth first-round win at Roland Garros, and she desperately wants to build on that on Wednesday. Having not won a set since 27 February before her redemptive win in Nuremberg, she struck nine aces and 18 clean winners while dominating the short rallies. She won 27 of 32 points on first serve. It kept her French opponent constantly guessing.“I started a little nervous,” Watson said courtside. “I was feeling really confident coming in, and loosened up. I played really, really well. It was tough to close it out. You could feel the rain coming. Throwing the ball up to serve I kept getting water in my eyes.“I was happy with my level throughout the whole match. Despite my season, I was feeling so confident coming into the match because I’ve done everything to prepare to the best of my ability.”Dodin played a curious first set, breaking at the start and throwing it away under quality pressure half an hour later. Watson remained calm after dropping serve and worked her way back into the contest, helped by the profligacy of her opponent, who served four double-faults, seven times in all, and converted only one of six break opportunities.Watson made the most of her early chances then blitzed Dodin in the second, despite a minor wobble in the final moments.

It is an inescapable fact that the native‑born content of British tennis at the highest level has been diluted over the years – the sort of anomaly to agitate Brexiters, perhaps, but happily irrelevant across the modern sporting landscape.Cameron Norrie – born in Johannesburg 22 years ago of Scottish parents, raised in New Zealand and adopted by the UK, where he has a home in London – nailed his colours to the Great Britain Davis Cup mast with an awesome debut in February, and he might inspire more pride and headlines in his third slam appearance here on Monday. “No one really knew who I was before that,” Norrie said on Sunday. “I hadn’t done anything on clay. Profile‑wise, it was great for me to get out there.”Coming off an excellent win against the world No 10 John Isner in Lyon last week to reach his first ATP semi‑final he plays the experienced and improving German Peter Gojowczyk, providing company, at least, for the British No 1, Kyle Edmund, who plays on Tuesday against Alex de Minaur. Alongside Johanna Konta and Heather Watson in the women’s draw, this constitutes one of the tiniest British contingents to invade France since the Scarlet Pimpernel and friends went underground to rescue aristocratic halfwits from the guillotine. If Norrie makes the cut in the first round, he will not be as surprised as some who are yet to catch up on his story; he gives every indication of becoming a valuable and interesting addition to the narrative, quietly confident and scared of no one.The most striking aspect of his imminent rise to 85 in the world has been his near-effortless embrace of clay: he had not played a Tour‑level match on the stuff until February, when he came from two sets down to stun the seasoned clay-courter Roberto Bautista Agut on the first day of the Davis Cup tie in Spain. The former captain John Lloyd called it “one of the most impressive debuts of all time”.If Norrie’s progress gathers pace this week, he will have so much of the stuff on his shoes he might wish he had never taken to it. “My coach [Facundo Lugones] is Argentinian,” Norrie says in an accent so neutral it might be computerised, “so I think that helps a little bit. Having the exposure at Davis Cup and getting to play against some of the best players in the world, the Spaniards, that helped.“My first time on clay was in juniors. Then I played a little on the futures circuit in the UK, like Bournemouth and Newcastle. Other than that, I never really played at all on clay and in college [in the US] I didn’t either.“I’ve gone in with quite low expectations and just tried to tactically use my forehand. I managed to practise a little bit with Kyle [Edmund] before this clay season. He is one of the best players in the world on clay. He’s helped me a lot. I’m pretty good endurance-wise. On clay the points are longer and it’s more physical. My game suits it well and I can only keep improving.”Stamina more than likely is in his genes. During his second slam appearance at the US Open last year – where he beat the tough Russian Dmitry Tursunov and gave the world No 19 Pablo Carreño Busta something to think about in three sets – his father, David, was cycling the route of the Tour de France. His mother, Helen, has run a 3hr 03min marathon, and her father was also a decent runner.Gojowczyk, who reached the final in Geneva on Saturday and has won more than he’s lost this year, could be in for a tough time on Monday."

World No 5 Karolina Pliskova lost her cool over a line call and bashed a hole into the umpire’s chair with her racket after suffering a 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 defeat by Maria Sakkari in the Italian Open second round. Pliskova had argued heatedly with umpire Marta Mrozinska after her smash was called out when serving at 30-30 and 5-5 in the final set, and her Greek opponent won the game before serving out the match. The Czech exchanged a brief word with Sakkari at the net before approaching Mrozinska with an outstretched hand before withdrawing it and repeatedly smashing the chair with her racket. Pliskova’s twin sister Kristyna, who also ranks in the world’s top 100, slammed Mrozinska on social media. “The worst i have ever seen @wta and i hope this lady Marta Mrozinska will never ever judge any match of me or Karolina again #blacklistforever,” the 26-year-old wrote on Twitter. Earlier in the day, top seed Simona Halep produced a ruthless display to see off Japan’s Naomi Osaka 6-1, 6-0. The Romanian was forced to save four break points in her opening service game but went on to claim 12 consecutive games to avenge her Indian Wells loss to eventual champion Osaka in March. The 20-year-old Osaka failed to convert any of her six break points before conceding the match in just under an hour. “I just tried to build my points, to build a little bit of space and open the court, and tried to make winners,” Halep said. “It’s tough to make winners on this court, for me, but it’s good when I can build the point. I just want to play like today.” Halep will next meet American Madison Keys, who clinched a 7-6 (2), 7-6 (0) win over Croatian qualifier Donna Vekic. World No 2 Caroline Wozniacki began her campaign with a comfortable 6-1, 6-4, victory over Belgian Alison van Uytvanck. The 27-year-old Dane, chasing her first claycourt title since 2011, will face 15th seed Anastasija Sevastova for a place in the quarter-finals. A decade after they last met in Rome, Maria Sharapova once again did enough to secure a victory over Dominika Cibulkova in three sets. Former world No 1 Sharapova struck 41 winners as she rallied back from a set down to edge her Slovakian opponent 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 in a thrilling two and a half hour contest. The 31-year-old Russian will next face Australia’s Daria Gavrilova for a place in the quarter-finals. Gavrilova recovered from 4-0 down in the third set to beat world number three Muguruza 5-7, 6-2 7-6 (6) in just over three hours. The victory means the 24-year-old Gavrilova recorded her first top 10 victory of the year, and her first back-to-back match wins since Acapulco in February."

As the sun set on the beautiful Foro Italico, the replica alabaster statues mute witnesses to a glorious past and an uncertain future, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic edged in front of their absent friends, Andy Murray and Roger Federer, a week before the French Open.Federer, who was creaking a little on the hard courts of America after his astounding performance at the Australian Open, where he beat Marin Cilic to win his 20th slam title, decided to rest rather than suffer the rigours of clay in anticipation of another tilt at Wimbledon glory. But, as he approaches his 37th birthday, even his remarkable longevity must surely soon be stretched to the point of incredulity.Whether Murray, who turned 31 this week, even makes it to the line at the All England Club is up for speculation again, with further locker-room talk this weekend that his recovery from hip surgery in January remains worryingly stalled. His chances of returning on the grass of Rosmalen in the Netherlands the day after the French Open final are rated “poor” to “marginal”, according to sources.Nadal, meanwhile, is rampant. He reaches for an eighth Italian Open title on Sunday, after beating Djokovic 7-6 (4), 6-3 in front of a packed Campo Centrale in just under two hours of some of the best tennis of the season. His aura on the dirt is undiminished – in fact, it is consolidated to the point that he is a raging favourite to win an 11th French Open.Victory in his 10th Rome final would put him back at No 1 in the world ahead of Federer, while Djokovic has surged again to somewhere near the form that won the Serb 12 grand slams, including the 2016 French Open. Regardless of the rankings, they are the two most dangerous players on clay at this moment.In the women’s final, the world No 1, Simona Halep – who outlasted Maria Sharapova over two hours and 23 minutes to win a brutal match 4-6, 6-1, 4-6 – will play the No 4 seed, Elina Svitolina, who turned away the reduced challenge of Anett Kontaveit, 6-4, 6-3, in a less demanding hour and a quarter in the first semi-final. Halep showed impressive resilience after a disturbing mid-match dip – and was soundly reminded of her responsibilities by her Australian coach, Darren Cahill – but there was still a great deal of fire to be seen in Sharapova’s game. Both will be threats at Roland Garros.Earlier, Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares got off to the perfect start in the first doubles semi-final, Robert Farah double-faulting on the first point and dropping his serve to love. However, the Colombian and his compatriot, Juan Sebastián Cabal, got on top of the Scotland-Brazil combination to take the first set and went on to win 7-6 (4), 3-6, 10-8.The focus of the day, though, remained fixed on Nadal and Djokovic. “I miss this feeling, I have to admit,” Djokovic said of the buzz he got from the high-quality contest, the crowd and his reinvigorated tennis. “I haven’t had that in a while. Looking back two or three months, this is the best that I’ve felt on the court, by far. But he was the better player. I don’t think that there was too much of a difference, which is great news for me, because Rafa is, of course, the best player ever to play tennis on clay. And he’s in great, great form.”Nadal celebrated his 25th win over Djokovic a year after the 50th meeting of their rivalry with glowing praise for the Serb, and no little empathy. “I don’t have any doubt that, if Novak wants to play, he will be back at his best,” he said when asked who he fears most in Paris. “He is too good to not be there.”Reflecting on Djokovic’s struggle with injury and his apparent tiredness towards the end of this match, he said: “We can’t forget that he came back from a long injury. And it’s difficult to be back. The first set was tough. It’s normal to be tired. And, when you are able to do things without thinking that much, then you are less tired. I think he’s ready for Roland Garros.”As for his own game, he is roaring again after the brief interruption of defeat by Dominic Thiem in Madrid last week, which snapped a remarkable record sequence of 50 unbeaten sets on clay. “I played with the right determination,” Nadal said. “The important moments later, in the tie-break, I think I played aggressive with my forehand. In the second set, in some important moments, too, [that] was the key.”As it has been for a couple of months. Nadal may not make any impact of note on the grass of Wimbledon but he remains peerless on clay. He now plays Alexander Zverev, the brilliant young German who beat Cilic 7-6 (13), 7-5 in the second semi in just over two hours – 26 minutes of which were in the tie-break. It should be some final. Zverev smashed one of his rackets to smithereens, energy he would be better advised reserving for his booming serve against Nadal."

It seems odd that Rafael Nadal’s domination on clay in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Paris has not been so evident in Rome, where he has a mere seven titles and last appeared in the semi-finals four years ago. Still, he will hardly complain and he will be mightily happy if he wins on Sunday as it will haul him back to No 1 in the world above the absent Roger Federer.The man he defeated 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 on Friday to reach the semi‑finals, Fabio Fognini, will afford the Spaniard little sympathy if he falls short. This was Fognini’s first quarter-final at his home tournament at the 13th attempt and he must have thought he could go further, or even all the way, when he came from 4-1 down in the first set to send Roman tennis fans into a frenzy on a perfect summer’s day.Last year Fognini defeated Andy Murray before the eventual champion, Alexander Zverev, put him out in the third round. But, at 30 and happily married to the retired 2015 US Open champion, Flavia Pennetta, he seems to have drained his game of the maddening inconsistencies that did for him so often in the past. Here it was Nadal’s forehand and a failing knee that stopped his bid.At 15-30 and 4-4 Nadal went behind for the first time after 53 minutes. Fognini, who had sprayed a dozen unforced errors around the Campo Centrale, was energised. He needed to hold serve to take only his 11th set off Nadal in 14 matches – and he did it right on the hour with a rasping forehand.The only man in tennis who puts his towel between his teeth had the bit there now but he knew retaliation would be swift. Nadal, roused from his slumber, opened up another 4-1 lead and this time levelled at a set apiece.Shaken by the counterattack Fognini resisted as best he could. This was an adagio, slow and drawn out, rather than the crescendo that Johanna Konta had referred to the previous day, describing that urge to finish a match in a rush. Fognini, limping, shoved a weary backhand wide and it was over after two and a quarter hours.“I made a couple of mistakes in the first set,” Nadal said. “I should not lose two serves in a row but he was taking the ball earlier than me and was able to control points from the baseline. Then I played a little more aggressive on my forehand.”It was the first time since Nadal returned to the Tour from injury that he had come from a set down to win. That pleased him immensely. “I had five months without completing a tournament. Since Shanghai until Monte Carlo I didn’t complete not one event. So the comeback has been great, no?”Yes, it has: it took Dominic Thiem on an inspired day in Madrid last week to snap his run of 50 sets on clay. He looks in the mood to resume his sequence. To reach the final, he has to beat Novak Djokovic, who showed grit to recover from an ordinary start against Kei Nishikori, winning 2-6, 6-1, 6-3 in two hours and 21 minutes.Following them on to the tournament’s cavernous showcourt on Friday Maria Sharapova found Konta’s conqueror, Jelena Ostapenko, a mirror image of bloodymindedness, the Latvian grinding her down to take the first set at the fifth attempt. Three hours and 10 minutes later it was the Russian who was smiling.She advanced to the semi‑finals with a fighting 6-7 (6), 6-4, 7-5 win that was engrossing, brutal and riddled with mistakes on both sides of the net: 21 double faults and 110 unforced errors.Ostapenko, behind in the serving cycle, needed to hold to stay on course for a two-set win, but Sharapova was equally determined. The former world No 1 was as emotionless as ever when a double-fault – Ostapenko’s 10th – handed her set point. She cashed in with a cracking two-fister at a sufficiently acute angle, and they went to a third after more than two hours of attrition.There was not a lot of it that was pretty but it was don’t-look-away tennis. Hitting like prizefighters, Sharapova moved 5-2 ahead, before Ostapenko, wincing with a foot injury, reduced her arrears to 5-4. The Latvian was ecstatic when Sharapova butchered her first match point, relieved when she netted the second. At 5-5 it looked like the match would never end but it was ultimately put to bed, under lengthening shadows, when Sharapova drove a backhand down the line."

Optimism laughs at the scoreboard at all levels of sport and, in different circumstances, Serena Williams and Johanna Konta took the concept to its outer edges on Monday, two weeks before the French Open.Williams, who is 36 and has played a handful of matches since winning the 2017 Australian Open when seven weeks pregnant, is a contender at Roland Garros, according to her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou.“Serena will play the French Open to win it,” he told the WTA’s website of her bid to lift a 24th grand slam title, despite pulling out of Madrid last week then Rome to build on her fitness at his academy in Nice. “Can she do it? Serena can achieve anything. After being her coach for six years I’m even more sure of that statement.”Konta’s forecast may not be so grand. She has yet to win a grand slam title and has not got out of the first round in Paris in three visits, losing last year to Hsieh Su-wei, a doubles specialist ranked 109 in the world at the time. However, she said: “I still maintain I have never not liked clay and I am really enjoying playing on the surface this year.”The evidence is not overwhelming. She lost to the world No 219 Fanny Stollar on the clay of Charleston last month, then the American qualifier Bernarda Pera (97) in Madrid. So the former top-tenner felt entitled to take heart from a tough but welcome victory over Magdalena Rybarikova at the Italian Open – her fourth on the spin in their rivalry.Konta also got the better of the Slovak in Madrid before losing to Pera and, despite hitting 40 unforced errors in one hour and 50 minutes to win 6-4, 6-3, she was smilingly upbeat.Having slipped out of the top 10 to 22 in the world, Konta undergoes further examination of her cheery resolve in the second round, when she plays either lucky loser Aryna Sabalenka or Hsieh.It is not a prospect that bothers her. “I seem to play the same people, so I wouldn’t be surprised if I play her,” she said, laughing.As for her quick rematch with Rybarikova, she said: “I knew going into the battle that it was going to be a lot of tough games, deuce games. That’s what we had last week as well. I’m just really happy I [handled] things well. I had a lot of break chances in the first three of her service games but I stayed tough, believing I was playing the right way. I was really pleased the way I was able to compete.”Rybarikova, a semi-finalist at Wimbledon last year, was bumped up in the seedings here when Petra Kvitova, Konta’s scheduled opponent, withdrew at the last minute, exhausted, after winning the Spanish title on Sunday.Four places ahead of Konta in the world rankings, Rybarikova stretched the first set to nearly an hour when Konta might have wrapped it up in half that time if overcooked backhands had not let her down in key moments. Nevertheless she maintained: “I felt good on both sides.”There could be no argument her killer forehand clicked pleasingly, however, and her first serve was on the money 66% of the time.In the peerless setting of Court Pietrangeli, Konta had five chances to break in the first set before crunching out nine points in a row on her opponent’s serve, then slowly found more rhythm in the second set.In all Rybarikova rescued her serve 11 of 16 times. On Konta’s second match point, a call went against her serve and, replaying the point, she looked relieved to force a closing mistake from her opponent.In Konta’s view there are way more positives than negatives. “I am moving well on the surface, I am a little clearer on how I want to play and also on how to keep my game as it is, because it is effective on the clay as it is on the grass and the hard. I am doing a better job this season to not really change something that doesn’t need to be changed.”She may prove to be right. There was at least evidence to suggest that, when her groundstrokes are flowing and she hits flat and hard to the corners, not many players can live with her. Her challenge this week and in Paris is to string enough of the good stuff together to go deep in the draw.Then, as she dissected her performance, she sniffled and said: “I’ve got a bit of a cold but all good. Wecrack on.”"

Andy Murray, still desperate to return to tennis in time for Wimbledon, has told his team he will delay his decision until the last minute.The two-times champion at the All England Club, who turns 31 on Tuesday, has abandoned tentative plans to make his comeback in the Loughborough Trophy, the new indoor hardcourt tournament which starts on Saturday.The aim is still to play on the grass, according to an insider, but “he doesn’t yet know if he’ll be 100% and will actually play – he won’t know exact plans until much closer to the time”.Murray, who has not played since losing in the Wimbledon quarter-finals last year and had surgery in Melbourne in January to correct a chronic hip complaint, is making a concerted effort to get his game in shape in time for a return in the Netherlands in a low-level grass tournament on 11 June, just after the French Open.He has also committed to play in the Championships at Queen’s Club, two weeks before Wimbledon, which starts on 2 July – although he is yet to discuss his usual promotional activities for a tournament he has won six times.Murray’s intensive rehab over the past five months, which gave him cause for optimism soon after he returned from Australia, has not produced the expected results and his on‑court preparation has stalled.His mother, Judy, tried to allay fears that Murray’s career is in jeopardy when she spoke to the BBC during the week. “I don’t think so,” she said. “He’s still got a lot of things he wants to achieve in the game.“His goal was always to be ready for the grass-court season and, fingers crossed, that will happen. I’m sure when he’s got some news he will share that. The strength and depth of men’s tennis is so great that I don’t think anybody would want to come back into that environment unless you are 100%.”"

Kyle Edmund, the absurdly quiet man of tennis, might be ready to make some noise but solely with the “thwap” of his racket strings as he unleashes another withering forehand here this week and perhaps at the French Open starting on Sunday week. Even beating Novak Djokovic in Madrid a week ago to move into the top 20 for the first time failed to disturb his submarine‑level temperament. Unlike some others the young Yorkshireman has not had to learn quietude.Born in Johannesburg, nurtured in the East Ridings and residing comfortably in the Bahamas, he oozes calm. Efforts to get Edmund to find his inner Andy Murray have failed miserably.“It’s another win,” Edmund says of defeating Djokovic, without a trace of arrogance. “That’s my job: to win tennis matches. So, it’s not like I go crazy about it. But I respect the win in terms of who Novak is. He’s a legend in the game and in history.”Edmund has an acute appreciation of where he has come from and where he might be heading. He played his first clay match in Goole as a 12-year-old and has steadily fallen in love with a surface that, for many players outside Spain and France, appears on their radar with the menace of quicksand. If there is to be a surprise winner – or even finalist – in Roland Garros, it could be Edmund.While he knows he is British No 1 because of the absence of the recuperating Murray, Edmund is also aware that he is worth his place among the young contenders who are gathering to nudge aside the game’s long-time masters.“To be able to be on court, first of all, is sometimes a bit surreal when you are growing up,” he says. “But, as I’ve been on the Tour a lot more, you have to try and beat these guys – because that’s your job. It’s nice to be able to go on court with Novak and know you are able to beat him. It gives you confidence, for sure.”He will take plenty of that into the second round here on Wednesday, when he plays Lucas Pouille, who beat Andreas Seppi in three sets. If Edmund wins, he will almost certainly meet the defending champion, Alexander Zverev, on Thursday – and there could hardly be a greater contrast in temperaments. The German with the Russian genes is loud, explosive and dangerous.Zverev, who dismantled Djokovic in the final last year, opens his account on Wednesday against the Italian wildcard Matteo Berrettini, who shocked the rising American Frances Tiafoe.Edmund, meanwhile, is reluctant to tamper with his game – an uncomplicated expression of flat power on both wings, behind a big if temperamental serve – and says: “In terms of what you do, that doesn’t really change. You have the same thought process and work on the same stuff. It’s not like you suddenly change as a person, either.”He has won $1m this year and 16 of his 24 matches but should have lifted his first Tour title when he reached the final in Marrakech last month. But he could not get past the world No 355, Pablo Andujar, and was deeply disappointed. But unlike in the past there was no spirit-dip: three days after winning a doubles title with Cameron Norrie in Estoril Edmund beat Djokovic – then the world No 10, David Goffin.Here he dropped a set against the 34-year-old Tunisian Malek Jaziri but impressed with a strong finish. To guard against the possibility of future upsets against outsiders Edmund has brought in a former international sprinter, Darren Chin, to supplement the training regime of Ian Prangley.Chin worked with Usain Bolt in Jamaica for two years and will fill in when Prangley cannot tour. He has noticed areas where the player can improve his movement, identifying, “acceleration and body positioning”. Chin adds: “The way you lift your feet, being light on your feet, Kyle tends to hit the ground quite heavy. Over time we will try to get it lighter, and the stretching as well.”As for Edmund’s brief problems with his hip, when pain there stopped his progress in the semi-finals at the Australian Open, Chin says: “We definitely keep on top of his hips. That’s the thing with tennis: because you are playing pretty much every day, it is hard to get the quality training in.”None of which will faze Edmund. Although he recognises that the wider media pack is circling with each big win, he never forgets that tennis is his job. “I know that’s going to happen so, when it comes, it’s not I guess a massive surprise,” he says.“That’s just going to happen, I’ll just get on and do it, have my time training and preparing and trying to get myself in a good place and meet the requirements off the court. I guess that’s part of being a professional.”"
